Members of the Welsh Assembly worried about 'passing for puppets'
Welsh lawmakers are dismayed by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment to the name of the assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of mockery.
A Labour official said his group is concerned that the acronym “rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crap.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (puppet), the distance is close.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the English letter u of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the name change, stated that “the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly rests with the members of the Assembly”.
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission is in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Welsh prefer MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove to be a real headache for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on the name change in the coming weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include further amendments concerning the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the question of the name during the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
Athens has long insisted that the name Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its neighbour's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said he would not take into account the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in trouble, Saint Martin bells silenced
“The elderly people I’ve talked to say that traditionally, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams says.
“There are no more today at all.”
In his opinion, it is normal that the bars have become rarer.
Today, “we don’t date in the same way anymore,” he explains.
“Before, we used to go to the bar as we did to our neighbor’s house, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out long before what the officials imagine and this worries him: “sooner or later, they will return to square one”.
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
“The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be white people who will rush the closure of all churches, as they are unlikely to become members,” he worries.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which blacks struggled to get hired or to get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new chime,
Father Johnson’s son and successor to the head of St. Martin’s Church, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the “poor people’s bells.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
She also mentions that this is the first chime in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, sat in front of the largest chime at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, there has been a lot of talk about the stirring of architects and contractors, caused by the secular elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay leaders, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wanted to impose on it the costs incurred, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old boy injured by shark during lobster fishing game
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while practicing lobster fishing in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the boy was shouting for joy at having a catch, then he realized that in reality he was having a catch.
had been bitten.
Upon approaching the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
“I was screaming for everyone to come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark,’” Chad said.
The boy was evacuated to Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
At a news conference, Chief Rescue Officer Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's Offensive Plans in the UK Aesthetics Market
Sainsbury's made low hand on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and lined them with supermarket-like shelves, filled with cosmetics and cosmetics and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn UK aesthetics market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home items are falling, more extensive beauty product shelves will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Supermarkets today are investing in the beauty market with the aim of reusing the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which for the first time will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket leaders have to dig their heads to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to shop online and head to local stores for everyday food.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened several Habitat stores since the two chains were purchased two years ago, which the group says has boosted sales of everyday consumer goods and made acquisitions profitable.
Previous attempts to restructure the British chain's pharmaceutical and cosmetics shelves had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it came to an end after a controversy over the distribution of profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, three years ago that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skincare brands to 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, sales director at Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of the beauty shelves has been modified to improve the customer experience.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer informed advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any type of need and, thanks to the embellishment of our shelves and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undeniable and changes shopping habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones's anger over Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Anger from Dragon's Den star Peter Jones following the announcement of host Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract for her home decor brand, to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to take care of the brand of interior decoration and accessories Truly.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is retiring.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their successful textile and interior design business at the last minute to devote herself to her new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the beloved TV kid revealed, during a tense meeting at the Dragon's Den star's commercial empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, no longer allowed her to look after Truly, their home decor brand and accessories.
The Truly brand has been equated with actress Gwyneth Paltrow's, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the host's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped on her private jet to join one of her second homes outside of Britain.
According to a source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's top priorities.
and in the process of securing its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could have imagined what would happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is filled with ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning host, who is among Britain’s most bankable celebrities, could cause millions to be lost to society, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones owned 40% of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity at ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but in the end we loved each other
Trump mocked the media that criticized him because of his comment that some consider “unworthy of a president,” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He laughed, taking the voice of a TV reporter.
“I haven’t given up anything at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un was in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump called the first meeting, which took place in Singapore in June, a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no “corresponding response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure exerted.
In his rally speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic outlook.
“Everything is fine with North Korea,” he said.
We have come close to the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of American military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, there are barely more than 200 people standing in front of me,” he said, pointing to the crowd.
Tsunami: A devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the help of foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok was scattered, but no state of national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for the initiation of international assistance.
“Unfortunately, many times they made it clear that they didn’t want international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether fieldwork will be allowed.
The spokesman for the national disaster management agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant upheavals, the country is severely lacking the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Shelters have been established in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm sirens sounded in Palu, which likely contributed to the loss of life.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed dilapidated infrastructure reform at the centre of his election campaign and has spent considerable sums to rehabilitate roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, undermined Mr. Joko's government, which is expected to run in front of voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure due to the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative manner.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes amid clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Premier League loss at Liverpool to Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 yards from Chelsea, and his team was led 1–0.
He shot into the ball on his left, before escaping a shot towards the second post.
The ball flew above the repair surface before heading to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended its route at the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to get in, grab the ball, but players like Shaq are always shooting as far as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching to control and without really much thought I decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward skipped a pass to Mateo Kovacic, before fleeing to midfield and sprinting to Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick back and forth in midfield,
Then he made a magnificent deep shot that took Hazard to the surface.
Hazard overtook the defense and finished his run in the net of the second post, with a left-footed shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Neapolitans in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Tsunami death toll rises to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami had killed 832 people.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the town of Palu was dotted with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the stabbed 44-year-old woman was discovered on John de Grayson Mews Street and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging residents who have seen or heard anything to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In particular, I appeal to taxi drivers, who could have captured something on their dashcam, and ask them to provide us with any information crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found on a Birkenhead property where she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they were informing relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene,
Repeating, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and one outside.
Several officers were guarding the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crime Failure Agency at 0800 555 111, as recorded in Registry 247 of September 30.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the latest victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural assets of England, committed by its puritanical supporters, such as the fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society found Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it a "revisionist attempt".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "Given the current debate over the removal of statues, it was clear that Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor conducted iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The superb depiction of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the esteem that was held for him in the nineteenth century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than he is today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, I mean monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the seventeenth century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated.”
China: A pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pigsty was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Wu, the rancher’s cousin, said that “his legs were crushed and covered in blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig behind Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid further incidents and allow police to gather evidence.
The rancher's family, Mr. Yuan, and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, attacks by pigs against people have already been reported.
In 2016, on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig assaulted a wife and her husband, seriously injuring the latter.
Ten years ago, a 295 kg pig trapped a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away from it.
In 2012, when a farmer in Oregon had just been eaten by his pigs, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that it was not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They’re pretty playful animals.
Very curious kids... they have no intention of doing any harm.
All you have to do is show them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause showers in northeastern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Winds were blowing at 135 km/h (Category 1 hurricane) from 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows east to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a storm, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical moisture to flow north into the southwestern United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous flash floods, debris runoff and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to rain between 5 and 10 cm in areas of the southwest, including much of Arizona.
Widespread tropical rains are likely to cause sudden flooding and a rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into wild rivers and thunderstorms will produce gusts of wind and dust whirlwinds in places.
The approaching depression will give rise to abundant local rainfall in some southern parts of the country, on the Californian coastline.
The rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause weak debris flows and make the road slippery.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall across the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected in October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropics' climate will remain warm.
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer from considerable temperature variations on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will attempt to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other regions of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
Several-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television channels on Thursday, the startling hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political stalemate continues, broadcasters have interrupted their usual Friday schedule to announce a showdown: an agreement devised by Jeff Flake, the Arizona Senator, to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford said she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had engaged in touching himself and had tried to remove his clothes during a high school night.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, said he was also 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people who watch TV at the office.
By way of comparison, the trial drew as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most watched channel on auditions day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC ranked second with an audience of 3.26 million.
Following were CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52), according to Nielsen.
The interest did not wane once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was being played on Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is taken aback by protesters as he tries to take the elevator to the judicial commission hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, as CNN broadcasted the sequence of the interpellation live.
“Don’t look away, look at me,” said one of the women.
“Do you really think he’s telling the truth?
You are in power when so many women are in need.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office issued a statement and would say more at the committee session.
All cable and broadcast networks covered the session live a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's nomination by the entire Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the allegations made against the candidate, which the minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was partly persuaded by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination without a prior inquiry.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault allegations.
May Accuses Brexit Opponents of ‘Little Politics’
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union, of making "little politics" at the expense of Britain's future and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a picture of Theresa May on the cover, its former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was “properly ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, has been jailed and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the scene of the crime, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, which determines that the death was caused by a bullet wound that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service acknowledges the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated and in shock" after news of Wayde's passing.
“We fear this kind of event all the time,” Wade said.
Mexico City: volcano spits out ashes
From the ash escaping from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Reduction recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after registering a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored several rumblings and tremors from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the level of the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: Clashes between police and separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being pushed back by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating clouds of dust in the streets, which usually do not displease tourists.
Clashes also erupted later in the day, while police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “neither forget nor forgive” faced unionists shouting “long live Spain.”
14 protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
One year after the October 1 referendum, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favor of separation, tensions remain strong in the independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with opponents of secession largely boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped on Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
This one was still there, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was taking part with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he had no hope of independence for Catalonia.
“We witnessed a great moment last year.
My parents were crying for joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are at a dead end,” he said.
Despite their capital victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on both sides.
“The tension is only rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to nominate his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
"This is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government," he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly breaking into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also shot with an arrow.
Livingston wins 1-0 game against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's win
The Livingston team recently climbed the ranks and surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to be in 2nd position in the standings, tied with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of an away victory in the Premiership league this season, and must face the Hearts team on Sunday, which leads by 8 points.
But first, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
As for Livingston, they are extending their undefeated career in the division by six games, and their head coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, can boast of not having lost a single game yet.
Livingston Missed Opportunity Against Stumped Opponents
Holt's team could have gotten ahead well before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson attempted to break but was stuck in front of the opponent's goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a header pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing that it could hamper them through elaborate tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied to catch Menga, who took a touchdown and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but faced impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half saw the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped a strike from Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to thwart one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston goalkeeper pushed back all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation against Glenn Middleton and the other for a foul.
The “phenomenon” of Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this upward slope.
Their style and the composition of the team have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the credit goes largely to Holt for having motivated a team since his arrival.
There are a lot of great players.
Captain Halkett’s defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes for the duration of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they have not lived up to their past talent.
They missed one last chance and only managed to pierce the opposing side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues were discussed, such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
On security grounds, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering outside the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of mostly Kurdish anti-Erdogan protesters have made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into his country.
The cleavage that emerges from the protests reflects Erdogan’s dual vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and described as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies following a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. local time near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescue arrived on the scene, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police said officers were making every effort to identify the individual and warn his loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus detours have been put in place. It is advisable for motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison officers were injured in a riot.
The riot began at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and is still out of control.
Specialist riot officers were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a wing of the prison.
At the scene, officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison management spokesperson said: "Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police officers were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City threatened by flash floods (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression hits Arizona, but that is likely to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading for the southwestern desert with what's left of its energy. This area could be hit by sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with predictable rains as early as Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the depression or tropical storm stage within a 300-kilometer perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm in places in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to experience 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with total isolated measurements of up to 10 cm.
The Rosa rains could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of sudden flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least one extreme category drought, the second most severe category.
Hurricane Rosa begins its path on the coast, in the peninsula of Baja California.
Still of great power on Sunday morning and generating winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located at 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane on Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, the rainfall could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Lower California northwest of Sonora and may reach up to 25 cm,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, crossing Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
“Torrent rains are expected in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These precipitations are expected to result in life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted homicide after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton, Saturday at about 4 a.m. local time.
He's been sent to the hospital, and his condition is currently stable.
Police in Avon and Sommerset said they had arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) overnight on the side of Radstock.
Officers appealed to people who may have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Has Been Victimized by Democrats’ Wickedness and Anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous methods,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the wickedness and anger of Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke to Congress on Thursday, denying with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of sexually assaulting her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” to this day.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he told the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a Republican party aide's statement to CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds, toll continues to rise
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them driven by huge waves that hit the beaches as an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when six-meter-high waves overwhelmed the beach at dusk, taking many lives and destroying everything in their path.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake preceded the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't happen alone, it drove cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and stores, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she said.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said human and material losses could be greater on the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the earthquake’s epicenter.
Communications were “completely paralyzed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could well get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to disseminate information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man upstairs in a building frantically shouting to passers-by on the street that a tsunami is approaching.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun delivering aid via cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuees are still in great need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia: Tsunami casualties are on the rise, with more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
Donggala World Vision staff arrived safely in Palu, where they found shelter in tarpaulin shelters in the backyard of their offices, and along the way discovered scenes of devastation, said Doseba.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a tragedy.
When relief groups began providing relief to the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami hit Palu, relatives of the missing people were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near her mother's body.
Indonesia's national paragliding team coach, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Others of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi added.
“As an alumnus in the discipline of paragliding, I have experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
Within hours of the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
His messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 when recharging a vending machine
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging a vending machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a vending machine in the entertainment complex and preparing to power it, said Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the vending machine.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities is requested to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now known as Ye.
Announcing the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before heading to Saturday Night Live, where he is due to present his new album, Yandhi.
Its participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for “emotional reasons,” explained the show’s creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current pseudo-professional, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, evoking the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“Then I am you, I am us.
I went from Kanye, which means “the one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West isn't the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the hyphen and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO declares that he will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly 50 years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly stipends to students and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people to join criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the United States is expected to double its funding for artificial intelligence research, according to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made announcements related to AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubting the funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are one step ahead of the U.S., and we’re looking for the next big discovery in AI,” says Lee.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of AI comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, then joined Microsoft Research's management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has previously participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that is taking over academic leaders, it’s business,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited big academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers,” he says.
The State Council of China unveiled its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academy partners, while the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, meanwhile, is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, the US legislation that works to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians made their voices heard in a referendum on changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of Macedonia’s majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum turnout of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The referendum question was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. It means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote was not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16%, when it reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which mobilized 66% of registered voters at the end of the election.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open the voice for NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small stage and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, accession to NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after filing his ballot.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published on Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected turnout rate.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of those intending to vote said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50% of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton’s defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the match 2-0 Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine scorer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender before knocking out the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took the opportunity to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to the Skyblues in the Premier League game,
from the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly from Brighton.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second post.
The forward of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before slipping out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer Wants to Play Trouble Parties Against the Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the play-offs, there was no reason to embark on a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of a playoff match for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Even if this game isn’t on the line, we want to walk the field in Denver, with that atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level that I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but would be inclined to give way to Scherzer in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will start on his usual day off on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with an average of 2.53 points and 300 withdrawals on 220-steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's Interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation generated by his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“All of our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I'm fighting on all fronts for great candidates," he said.
“You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see it over the last four days,” he added, before calling the Democrats “angry, mean and liars.”
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which resulted in him being booed by the public.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm expecting one. It was very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it once was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from my local party’s Momentum movement voted to censor me, it came as no surprise.
After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs who are considered unwelcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received equal treatment because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
As for me, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, these are topics for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said, “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
This is exactly what the Friday evening general assemblies were like during my eight years as a Labour Party parliamentarian.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many rallies and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It has become clear that opposing opinions are no longer tolerated within the party; each opinion is judged on its acceptability by party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy took power, and colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political vision began to expect me to turn my jacket around and take positions that are the opposite of my beliefs, whether it is about national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive tirade on social media, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the center, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were political in nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a surge of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current policy is the standardization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that great community and the party is restricted by the motions of no confidence and changes to the selection rules.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years: look down, don’t express my ideas so loudly, and everything would go well.
But it is not to act as I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy because the negligence of the Thatcher government had caused my classroom to collapse, and since then I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and utilities. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes that I stand for, which are your interests at all.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains undefeated
Two late trials may have distorted the final result, but no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day game of the Scottish Rugby Championship.
The team now occupies the top of the rankings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this match.
“Until now, we have been tested, but we remain undefeated, so I have to consider myself happy!” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “Congratulations to them, they were more effective than us and were able to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's test in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish squadron Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just at halftime. He scored and turned a solo try to go up the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
This was followed by a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher. During the recovery, Ayr took the lead again with a test of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's acting captain, was then given a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an unprocessed attempt by Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team took over and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for kicking Climo when he didn't have the ball, since the penalty kick, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's maul, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the restart, after Kyle Rowe rounded up David Armstrong's box kick and sent wingman Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth home run.
The star of Still Game launches in the catering
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, has decided to make a career in catering. The comedian has been appointed director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-animates with his longtime partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series to arrive will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source at the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant environment".
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol an armored boat in the naval headquarters of La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: “The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout the blockade of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still very much present, as is the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades, for Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of the Bolivian request. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who is facing a controversial re-election fight next year), also has much to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Chile, and that little would change, even if the decision were positive.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even harmed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ bellicose rhetoric undermined all remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to trade, but after that it will be very difficult to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision-making was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales – who remains to this day one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would not give up its nuclear weapons until it had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri says it is "chimeric" to think that maintaining sanctions and US opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean War will bend the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness in renouncing an arsenal that the country considers the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows unveil the latest trends in headgear, which may soon be available in your stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun 100%, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of oversize hats during a PE19 show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Hats all more extravagant than each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delusional pieces into the runway shows.
Valentino's flagship piece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a wide edge evoking a feather, which engulfed the heads of the models.
Other oversize accessories included jewellery-embellished watermelons, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple, but these pieces weren't designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had their lips sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than Haute Couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, with snorkeling and glasses, while another resembled a molten ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you are in luck.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come all the way to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow in the wake of the "Bomba", the wide-board straw hat that the stars tear off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that sells this hardly portable hat that has flooded social networks has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the centerpiece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus fashion show during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags coming to stores next summer. The designer has so impressed the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they have chosen and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector able to design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
If we look at the excellent results in the exams this year, we find that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates among independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages scored the highest grade, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of students scored the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as did the 72% of students who studied German, the 69% of students who studied French and the 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and youth in the future.
Now, languages as subjects are organized just like science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey found that of the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates, 17% are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job openings requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of their career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this lasting skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the UK, 75% of them did not have sufficient command of a foreign language to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking multiple languages, including those in emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on contemporary classical languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the 2020s, including Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that today, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Saturday
The wait is almost over for fans watching LeBron James’ debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still don’t know how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few limited minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need any pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump campaign in West Virginia (YouTube channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stopovers, notably in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the confirmation vote for the vacancy in the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections and preventing Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia meeting tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault hearings this week, and Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed for up to a week during the FBI's investigation.
But this series of rallies is primarily aimed at helping Republicans gain ground ahead of the November elections.
According to Reuters, the U.S. president said in his campaign that the five rallies were intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an essential part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of this busy election campaign,” a spokesman for the Trump team told Reuters, who declined to be named.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight’s meeting, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media.”
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who lags behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to revive him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team ready to fight for hope as Sunday's singles approach
After three singles, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes may well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swing movement is a sporting concept invented from scratch but which players sincerely believe in, and more than ever in tournaments like this one.
Where would they find the momentum now?
“They were leading with six points and now four, so it gives us a little bit of wings,” Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a bit of the wind in the back and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can boast of having each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has proven to be terribly effective from tee to green and is setting an example.
The energetic shouts of joy intensified as his game progressed, and a crucial putt allowed him to equalize in the fourth part while Thomas and he were led two downs after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game in the 15th hole, aroused a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team still in the game.
“You really have to stay determined and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by Ryder Cup history.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four matches and is not entitled to the mistake.
Not only were “Moliwood” the only ones not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the delusional crowd appoints them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets over the National Golf Course.
Preferably, both at the same time to different holes.
But talking about European glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated morning fourball hero Sergio Garcia as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and Swede into a hole they could never get out of.
On Sundays, no one is there to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don’t, and how a strategy can flip in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a considerable lead over the last day, but this foursome session has also proven that the Americans have the courage to fight, which was doubted by some, especially at home.
Europe lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 over the United States in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a distressed Tiger Woods, scoring four points so far.
Determined to keep the title she lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by winning 3-1 in the morning fourballs, against a messy American team.
The United States demonstrated greater resilience in the foursomes and won two victories, but they failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight points out of 12 on Sunday in the singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a crushing weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they beat the pair composed of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through Saturday's two games, shone a few times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, under a cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes as they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a team has recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, only has to draw to keep its trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says that disarmament cannot be done “under any circumstances” unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that continuing sanctions strengthened its distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the world body, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While reiterating North Korea’s well-known criticisms of Washington’s opposition to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it gradually took action, his statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work toward a “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea first proceed with denuclearization and accentuates the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even opposing the "declaration of the end of war".
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us fall don’t know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our distrust.”
Ri made no comment about the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted before the United Nations by the American leader earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: “If the party concerned by the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s, when he declared before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after the “evil” President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened at the United Nations last year to “totally destroy” North Korea, did not laud this year the courage with which Kim applied measures towards disarmament, but added that much remained to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set. “It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the application of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would travel again to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced his “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has put in place a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fights against the growing macho trend of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
A professor has noticed that most students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of themselves
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is according to him the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him.
At the end, a student came up to me and said, "Why am I only told that in the last year?"
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
Taught for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general manager of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The class time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map featuring interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not instantly change students’ behavior.
However, in our view, they have the right to know this information – in the same way that you have the right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the pride culture of “sleeping at night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having enough and good quality sleep should be students' "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, making them starving permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and pushed him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar program of study before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for both bedtime and wake-up times, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another blow away, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disjointed team in Livingston to a 1-0 loss.
The Ibrox team had hoped to record their first away win since their 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team adrift, eight points behind the Ladbroke Premiership-leading Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers are now dropping to sixth place, Livingston is in third place, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, referee Calum Spence having to be treated for a head injury following the throw of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, meanwhile, picked the same Livi 11 who snatched a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team suffocating his opponents every round.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored at two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but defending teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second post
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have received a penalty after the free kick when Steven Lawless and he collided but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a shot from Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's opening score in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' stopped kick.
Scott Arfield didn’t react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for a straightforward finish.
Gerrard reacted to the halftime by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the trade almost had an immediate impact when the wingman showed up in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston still continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls over long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the last few moments, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while battling Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COMPUTER TOURNE... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that later gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado,” starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man asks, “What is this?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, we use it to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
“Thanks to these headphones, we can actually hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “Tell me, it’s definitely jumping out there!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
New Cancer Vaccine Allows the Immune System to ‘Detect’ Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Allows the Immune System to ‘Detect’ Cancer Cells and Kill Them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “causes an increase in several types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
A similar approach, which involves taking immune cells to “teach” them to target cancer cells, has been proven to be effective in treating a type of leukemia.
Wearing a MAGA cap, Kanye West embarked on a Pro-Trump diatribe after his move to the SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was booed on set after a wild performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for election in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang while wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump?
“Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock was going to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I’m in a ditch,” he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see him, the abyss?" and claimed that he would wear his superman cloak, because no one can dictate his actions.
Try the love.”
His comments were booed at least twice by the public, and members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. A person on the scene told the magazine: "A deadly silence has fallen on the entire set."
West had been called in at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West upset a lot of people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of TPUSA Conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR KEEPING THE HEAD OF THE Crowd."
But Karen Hunter, the show's host, tweeted that West was simply "loyal to himself, and it's absolutely wonderful."
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying their music, their clothes, or by supporting their art) who, in my opinion, adopts and dumps an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He was not the first artist to change his name and followed in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg bore the name of Snoop Lion and of course the legendary firefighter Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Charged With Attempted Murder After Knife Attack At Restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the series Game of Thrones, attacks the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this type of role on screen often leads young boys to pretend to be tough to cook to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes “something is wrong” and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of <0x23>MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, confessed that he was “firmly” keen to tackle this issue.
“Personally, I think deeply that we have mistreated masculinity.”
“What teachings have we given young men who are becoming adults, in relation to the problem that arises now?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been instilled?
What do television and the street teach young boys that they have to behave like that to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There’s obviously something wrong.”
In the interview, he also confessed that he would not make prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming to have finished with "the battlefields and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a cover of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this show, so she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients have been contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in parts of the country following transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been practically reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
In the Chinese LGBT community, HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee leaked senator data, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were supported by experts and "far-right" websites.
"Lies, lies, and more infamous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the information leaked included addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by a stranger on Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, the White House's former press secretary.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not call into question the accuser's motives.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' seat in the midterm election, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the relevant law enforcement authorities and services” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts to all members of my team.”
Johnny English strikes again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, under-gifted spy
It has now become a tradition to look for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this reprise of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction about the obviousness of our insignificance represent our country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent, fluffy-eyed, rubber-faced Johnny English has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicates above all that it is a great comedic creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charmer, possesses a little Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean, and a good dose of the guy who runs a little note in The Fire Carts at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was also inspired by the traveler and man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves compose confidently with comedy.
The humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and to me Johnny English’s freakish misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s silent film gags in the character of Bean.
The ever-present premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of agents on duty - a role unfortunately of small scale for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the verge of crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to get under the tooth in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy being compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means disturbing Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a fancy school as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice jokes here, as English offers a Rock Academy-like spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his longtime partner, again encamped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are creating big trouble for Her Majesty's secret services, return to the action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the grip of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of farcical jokes: under the disguise of waiters, they set fire to a blazing French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking on the luxurious sailboat of Volta; and English triggers a veritable anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are insured for this last sequence, but in spite of everything, there is a lot of stuff for the children in all this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, as with the other Johnny English films: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan for the British to be able to work four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week – but be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while still earning the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to orient the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.”
“It won’t be done overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back into the hands of "anonymous directors" and "profiteers" in public utilities.
The deputy chancellor's plans also provide that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their stakes as the Labour government may make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed his plan to integrate workers on company boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the private company capital to employees, who will pocket up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview Sunday, Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“On my way to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when those allegations were made, and I asked him, “Did you do this?”
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous.”
However, Graham’s vote seems engraved in stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she names couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old business.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of stars and invested in an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clickivism” — a situation where people really think they can make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped spur global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies worth more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and executives who are committed to “helping children reach their full potential”, while promising <0xC2><0xA3>35 million in aid to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition program ambassador, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on her website, “What makes you think it’s possible to end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: “The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will animate the show.
U.S. could call on Navy to create ‘blockade’ to hinder Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can “if necessary” call on the U.S. Navy, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – especially where it operates at the request of the legitimate government – is a pretext for it to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East for the purpose of negotiating energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this situation.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not put on the market," he added.
Zinke was speaking to attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a not-for-profit organization that defines itself as the "Speaker of Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “more than a rope to its arc” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has pledged to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Trump says makes the city of Berlin “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a September speech in Moscow following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said “I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The U.S. position provoked negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to get involved in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for president following the midterm election.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she says, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to the poll by the University of Suffolk and the Boston Globe’s Center for Political Research, 58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other prominent Democrats named for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to The Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin discusses Track Palin PTSD during Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged as part of a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is feeling right now, what he is feeling on the way home, I can connect him to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a “taboo subject” and said about his son and other veterans that “they come back a little bit different, hardened, wondering if they respect what their comrades and air force members, and every other military, have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon.
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a memorandum in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum claims in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Council that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be considered according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said in its memorandum.
The lawyers also argued in the brief that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
“Asylum was never designed to alleviate every problem – even the most serious ones – that people face every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts at Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her feverish little boy in Palu, at an evacuation center in the empty city.
“At every moment, an ambulance is bringing bodies back.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen walking into their destroyed homes, picking up soaked goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who was suffering from a fractured back and shoulders, rested outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Intimidation' Through 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page advertisement touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. parliamentary election, an accusation China denies.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to meddle in the U.S. election, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, at the press office in Beijing, you will find few protesting voices and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have on the disturbing Chinese economic trajectory, because the media firmly obeys the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China has avoided publishing" his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating voters ahead of midterms due to Kavanaugh debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding this affair have been extremely lively, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they want the vote to take place.
In a Sept. 29 article in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said "we can't go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation were enough to calm voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” in the hallway of the Senate as Republicans running the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be out of proportion,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But that could be even higher, especially among suburban voters and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even though they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public deposition detailing allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction would likely be lively if Republicans pushed forward with confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier last week that “It has become a confusing mess for the GOP.”
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the nomination of Kavanaugh, it's also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it," Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, said in a statement.
As a result of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, however, Americans seem to be divided about the credibility of both sides, with a small majority leaning towards Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that leverages Berners-Lee’s free Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is authorized to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was aimed at “dominating the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and business tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company brings the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not yet in talks with “Facebook and Google” about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely upended in an instant.
“We are not asking for their permission.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a World War I clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was however killed by a sniper four days later and did not know that he had been awarded the highest British military distinction.
Her two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's feat.
According to the London Gazatte, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent fire of field guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with "greatest bravery", guided the line before blowing up a field gun on his own and knocking out three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something that I will never be at, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Vann said he felt "very honored to be part of the show" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent all night watching a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, including six on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were astonished when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to have stayed awake until the early hours of the morning especially for combat.
A supporter on Twitter described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad joke.”
Speaking about the transmission, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said: “The government regulation states that at 6 a.m., this content was not suitable, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said they would be working on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, that is Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee you it won't happen next time.
We’ll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried to give more to the fans and we screwed it up.
This is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘lower’ in sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he did not realize before going to high school that “everyone [was] not like me.”
As part of the first show of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's regular host, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
Appearing as a shipwreck on Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, “Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a well-known LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give “hope” back to others.
The triple world champion said he “didn’t expect” to fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, his 20-year-old eldest, but he said age difference had never been a problem.
"When you see so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says confided that it was difficult to find a person of the same age having experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole outlook" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I was just thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are things more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be seated in the front row.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘Dad, you won’t be there to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I was holding him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he had to die before I could finally recognize that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I've dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which had accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 a.m., BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record this Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to straighten up to avoid an unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who was competing in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was beaten by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time grand champion has divided his day between the role of supporter and the refinement of his game at the stand in order to remedy his ailments.
He has never been the greatest leader, even at the top of his career. At 48 years old, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough systematically punishes the missed strokes.
And as if the course was not fearsome enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four downs early in the 12 singles games, make a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn’t say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a slap in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two games.
I was anticipating more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room.”
“I think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He does more than just play.”
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the Ryder Cup final day singles can easily turn into a difficult course.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep remembering that we were leading widely in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but just right," Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 Ranking win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go all the way tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until we have the points on the board.
We have a goal, to try to win this trophy, and that’s what we have to stay focused on.
I have always claimed to focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side – they are the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's a completely different pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performances that will be presented and it is quite different.
It’s great to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there on your own, you’re put to the test of your full ability as a golfer.
That’s the message for the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players perform better individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of those last day turns, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the "Miracle of Medina", where Europe snatched the victory.
“I remember every word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to get his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should do, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the whole course,” Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg frigates, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery jeopardized the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as certain stealth technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years outside the home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the relentless delays mean that the forward-thinking warships – which should allow Germany to project its overseas force – will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly significant as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half the crews of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which decreases its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs twice as much as the similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the price of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to 2.2 billion at the outset.
Problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is decreasing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact “short of ships able to deploy.”
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were declassified but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland researchers' study will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special registration devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld sensors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat screams as well as the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect perches and lead to the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-killing papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight path.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave site in Dumfries-et-Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there’s still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before maintaining the properties, because by unintentionally destroying a single maternity nest, it can cause the death of 400 females and young, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or destroy their perches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations right now.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him “false information,” and claimed that people “want to make themselves known” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep her silent about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram just hours after the allegations aired, Ronaldo, 33, called the information “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called an “inadmissible denunciation of privacy suspicions.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel-casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape allegedly occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "good guy" at "99%" but that he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they were consenting.
Mayorga also said she went to police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently agreed to an amicable settlement because she felt “terrified by reprisals” and feared “suffering public humiliation.”
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to rescind this rule as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged assault, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve as part of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “regret forever” the departure of the car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State in charge of Trade, the United Kingdom “would regret it forever” if it were to lose its status as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director in Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade works.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are about what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated in "tensioned flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disturbances at the border that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We need an agreement, we want to have the best deal that, as I said, will not only take advantage of the current success, but also seize this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The obvious, not just from Toyota but other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
While Toyota was not able to specify how long production would be stopped, it warned that in the longer term, the extra costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the union coordinator for Unite at the plant and who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston, said its members were increasingly worried: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
White House Announces Trump and Rosenstein's Meeting May Be Further Delayed
According to the announcement made Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred by a week", while the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser tasked with investigating Russian interference in the elections, the ties between Trump’s collaborators and Russia, and possible obstructions to justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone in order to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, on Monday, he ran for the White House as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set for that, it could be this week, I could see if we pushed it another week given all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I like to keep the press informed.”
The claim would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of lectures was not due to an aversion to "demagogic" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they amaze the gallery."
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing any evidence, she added that “the president participates in more Q&A sessions than any president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
There will always be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to question the president of the United States directly, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do that frequently, as you’ve seen in recent weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare for him to hold solo press conferences there.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times a bizarre appearance before the assembled journalists.
On Brexit fears, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal have continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to result in decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
According to Tennessee State’s Mike Organ, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers’ second baseman, had an emergency surgery after a head injury Saturday during the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 loss.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him through another exam.
A Tennessee state representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris said there were "no details yet on the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student athlete, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee following his transfer from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative regimes.
This move will undo the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy property in the UK - the extra money will go to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used to strengthen the government’s efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purchases - could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of London’s new buildings are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which drives up prices and prevents first-time buyers from gaining a place in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large construction companies of keeping property prices high by hoarding land without using it, he called on May to waive quotas on affordable housing in an effort to address the “real estate misfortune” plaguing the UK.
Corbyn presented an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and the elimination of “no fault” evictions.
He also wants to give councils more extensive powers to build new housing.
May said: “Last year, I said I would dedicate my post as prime minister to the rebirth of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the UK, as for foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hard-working British residents.
For far too many people, the dream of accessing property has become remote and the misery of the homeless remains too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is delighted to face the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in Ligue 1, three points from the leader.
He rallied to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching the Scottish games at Hampden with my father and that’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity would only present itself, on the other hand, if I succeed in the management of the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coaches are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he has not hesitated to rank behind such iconic names in such a big club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in light of the question ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably only consider myself a success here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross has only three years as a coach, after a stint as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa rebound from a relegation to the third division and turned St Mirren, who was on the brink of relegation, into a big championship winner the following season.
Ross felt more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa's care "was probably a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I really thought being a coach was better than playing.
It seems strange because I did well, I made a good living and I enjoyed some appreciable peaks.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to be worked out each week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is fine with me.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I’ve ever felt in my entire adult life.”

The summer heatwave has pushed up the revenues of struggling British pubs, but has added pressure on restaurant chains.
Figures indicate that bar and pubs groups posted a 2.7 percent increase in their sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, which compiled the data, said: “Permanent sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed the June model, where bars had seen a 2.8% increase, except for restaurants, which suffered an even greater shock.
The 1.8 percent decline in the catering sector in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most in vogue, with more points of resemblance than restaurants that are down.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM Hospitality and Recreation Analyst, said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decline in annual average sales of 4.8% is particularly painful, in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less opportune for food operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide a well-deserved respite.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in implementation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry standard established.
On social media, one in five children have secret accounts they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news has accentuated concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – opens a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “Insta fake accounts” — a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has accentuated concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported running a cleaned “main” account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who happened upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who incited others to “rape me.”
According to a study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11- to 18-year-olds have a double profile, with half of students admitting to having private accounts.
MSC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teens are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the sport’s leaders to leverage their extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from his participation on the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and lead this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200m and 400m at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover or how well.
It was a challenging job, but I recovered completely, I relearned to walk and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Online, an advertisement on the breast pump that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertisement for a milk pump company compares nursing mothers to cows when milking.
To mark the launch of what’s known as “the world’s first silent breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched a bold music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom its new breast pump offers breastfeeding women.
In a hay-filled cow's barn, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: "Yes, I treat myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice, it's my breasts, not breasts."
The refrain goes on: “Pump it, pump it, I feed babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help women milking.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the dairy industry’s “horrors.”
“A poor decision than to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them in the days after they are born,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “This is an understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are babysitting?”
Someone else added, “An ad so disconnected.”
Others defended the advertisement, for example a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious".
“I think it’s an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a fun advertisement for moms who are pumping their milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It's not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discreet breast pumps hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, without wires or pipes, and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, Partner and DPE at Mother commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between lactating mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast milk extraction and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new breast pump will provide.
This isn't the first time milk pump Elvie has made headlines.
During fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium of the designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently settled in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because the Trump administration’s harsh speeches and policies have made it difficult for children to be placed with respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants and they feared compromising their own ability to stay in the country by going to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their household should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
“Nearly 80 per cent of respondents or their family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people,” Albence said.
According to the shelters' stakeholders, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their case regarding their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible will be expelled quickly.
According to stakeholders and reports presented in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempted escapes.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be overlooked because of their size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have a hard time dealing with.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be “treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Mualem said the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, as more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” of both terrorist groups and any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem said of the refugees that conditions were favorable for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that dissuaded refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have said that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war is concluded.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib's last rebel fortress has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that the military measures will target jihadists, especially Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Mualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the group’s work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution,” and issued a warning against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers doubtless hope, impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
This would be “the most spectacular final of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, rush hour odds have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at prime time, is the first cable television channel.
“It’s a case that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, host of ABC’s drama series Designated Survivor, about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedian and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about sneaking into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She recalls taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike everything that happens on television, Washington’s scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade affair, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts debate how Bob Woodward used “deep know-how” for his book “Fear,” on Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket.
I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
“If part of what he’s doing feels like watching a reality show, it’s because he’s making you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s changing teams and day-to-day turnarounds (fighting with the NFL, congratulations Kim-Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees at his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was lurking inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not break away, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the days when we animated all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from outside invades the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania was flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of the ridings of Congress that allowed two incumbents to compete for the same seat.
This suburban district of Pittsburgh, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another riding in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is matched by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district kicked off a clash regarding the financing of election campaigns between the major branches of party financing, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win last March in a very popular special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then backed down
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington opposed little.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization leadership.
State Department officials decided to convene the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only foreseen against El Salvador, which received an estimated US$ 140 million in aid in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, seen as a breakthrough in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now speaking at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their remarks were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying History
The next tile could be special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mueller would also focus his investigation on the issue of a collusion of Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself held accountable to that body as he prepares to represent himself before voters and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
These are many “ifs,” and I’m not claiming that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divisions and the inescapable march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these divides.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since the newspaper reported last year that he offered to secretly record the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we say if the FBI’s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite sexual assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump to account?
If we fail these tests, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table wearing the swastika.
With this legacy, I can’t help but be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienne on Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a solid position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first appearance of the season until the 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to achieve feats.
"It was a positive for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," commented the 31-year-old striker.
“We came into the game thinking we could get something and we left with a point.
We might have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European night.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they did a good result in their last match, however I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
“Last year was really tough, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is of quality.
Let’s hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind and triumph.”
Women can no longer find sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings
While the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be taken care of, few people discussed the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they told their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not doing what it takes to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you figure out how to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a redemption value to help you cover those expenses, or other insurance on your assets - provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles by the way.
Provide a health care power of attorney that will allow you to appoint a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think of the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put that plan in place.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the toll is expected to increase.
With communications paralyzed, rescue services could not receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that runs more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, particularly the Donggala Coastal Region.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic fire circle of the Pacific and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on 26 December on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake shook the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Significant earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, in violation of a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone of a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Pre-trial Detention Center and is being held on unsecured bail of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, pleading "not guilty, that's for sure" when his plea was asked, the network announced.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor B offence, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His wife said he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the toll of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck just off central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu at the time the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Claim Rare Death Penalty for Person Suspected of Terrorist Attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who killed eight people — a rare sentence that has not been applied in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing pedestrians and a cyclist on his road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to apply for the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “careful preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling Saipov’s method “odious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not demanded the death penalty as part of prosecutions for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was later sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal New York case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for engaging in acts of conspiracy and espionage for the USSR in the two years following the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he was instigated to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the Daesh flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” with the decision to prosecute.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and sentence him to life imprisonment with no possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
The team defending Saipov had already asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to “mobilize the People’s Army” during a demonstration at the Conservatives conference.
The former UK Independence Party leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested, he should be tasked with negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK "would have already been freed" if Mr Farage had been secretary for Brexit.
But the dilemma May faces to reconcile her deeply divided troops has been highlighted by conservatives in favor of staying in the Union who joined an isolated anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its agenda and “chaos.”
Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of Chequers.”
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have gone out already,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We did not engage in world wars to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely wrong.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who is in favour of leaving, was also present at the march to tell reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, this is also the case of our party and our activists who roam the streets and make us elect above all.
Give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Ms May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should be made to “feel the pressure” if they were about to betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They’re trying to cheat Brexit and we’re telling them today, “We’re not going to let you get away with it.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I wish you would make the pressure felt on our political class who is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has allowed us to win the Brexit victory and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters marched through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved anti-Brexit Conservative banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives because of security concerns about the party's enforcement at the start of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a real farce.
A good Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider running for president
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future Saturday at a public assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, runs for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the GOP’s representative in the states, who was co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as part of a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington in order to repair our broken government, which involves having a woman head of state.”
Arrest during the shooting death of Sims from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department was involved in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man who appeared on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims received a bullet wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 Sports on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a gun, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2-meter-high who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads for world title after team directives allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team’s instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas took a good start and brushed Hamilton on the sidelines as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and left Hamilton to get into the turmoil at the tail of the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the pits one lap later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside at the risk of resisting after a double-defense attempt in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first lap to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated a large part of the race while keeping his tyres to aim for a fast finish and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He eventually made it to the pits on lap 44, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen finishing fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a one-two,” said Hamilton.
It was very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but argued that the events in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate these last few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“Seeing the disclosures and the leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I did not disclose anything.”
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak information... No, we didn't leak information," he added, thinking of the senator's impression.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I have not concealed Dr. Ford’s allegations, I have not disclosed his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: “I’ll tell you, it was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that Democrats were using those allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the pettiness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars erased Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return game at Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer gave the Giants the lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, securing them victory.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast, after being overtaken.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt went on to serve Cownie at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team came together and Bouchard tied again with a goal giving a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal midway through.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board an airplane to escape the quake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area and large numbers of people are trapped under rubble in the town of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his post in the violently shaken tower at Palu’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained on site to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken to learn this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The toll would continue to increase as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have ravaged Palu who will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after a plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline that handled the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew evacuated the sinking plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it has not been able to track down a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were involved in rescuing other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes says.
Jaynes said he and the others could have slipped into the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
l claimed that the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to upgrade a wharf had also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people to dry land before the plane sinks into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst presents chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its case Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that indicated Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers's when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "[lying] because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’s text messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by impregnating its music with positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York nanny sues couple for firing her after 'racist' text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message mistakenly transmitted by the mother who complained that she was “still a Black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, and equates the prosecution with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay when she found out in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yet instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, after understanding his “uncomfortable” misstep, dismissed Ms. Maurice, telling her that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipina instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day’s work, then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Mauritius is suing the couple for compensation for their dismissal and is seeking compensation of $350 a day for the six-month home service for which they were initially hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do that kind of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to terminate Mauritius' employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after harming him.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Calling the trial “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
“Would you chase someone like that?
It’s not a very pleasant thing to do,” the business banker added.
While the case is still pending, the public opinion court did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, new letter unveils
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s a lot of fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a "bitter-sweet" flavor after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” and adds that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a fairly calm man, and he wasn't a pretentious man," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds at something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect her to get away with it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him to maintain his heart rate were slowly running out of steam and coming out of his system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the ordeal she was going through.
“No one was aware,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning drop postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, from Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any room.
However, he gave up his job before dying, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler’s brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid there's a trigger."
Davis created the maps “to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if they’re friends.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his attitude change.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day — when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t have eye contact with them or anything.”
She said her death had been a huge trauma for them, but they have to get through it: “It’s heartbreaking for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for — a time-limited investigation, limited in scope — we might be able to bring some unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “collapse” into a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans score poorly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters ‘falling’ under Kim’s leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions had taken place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and increased tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters will ultimately be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of talks centered on the denuclearization negotiations that had hitherto remained pending.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly, to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we will be the first to conduct unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh "Hysterical" and Says He's Unfit to Sit on Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, they would have called her "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and choked himself by referring to his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling his allegations a “grotesque and coordinated assassination” by Liberals disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, since he showed he was against Democrats.
“I think he’s discrediting himself with these statements and the way he’s dealt with the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also unfit to sit in the court where he currently sits,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation of charges hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh evaded the issue of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, do you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to say to the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried, ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with inexpressible rage, was that I was seized by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always terrified me a little - who dragged me down a staircase.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re delighted because they’ve had you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic MP for Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the running, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Somebody called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was very advanced, she was delayed in raising funds, and therefore swore that she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters, who usually donated $1,000 to men, only intended to give her $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions — the gratitude for the people who had supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sexism — that she felt dizzy.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled of the media’s reaction to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my gravestone.
“She cried?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The first bursts of the trade war between the United States and China have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs affecting items worth US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing has responded in kind, hitting tariffs of 5-10% on $60 billion of US goods.
China is committed to matching the U.S., and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to falter anytime soon.
To push back Washington is to give in to demands, but to give in publicly to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually much more dangerous than what observers have previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the 14.5-point mark needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who found himself in trouble for most of the tournament, pushed his start into the water in the 16th hole in a par-3, ceding his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5-4 by the European team's lowest-ranked player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top golfer, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain’s Sergio Garcia became the all-time European champion with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was a turbulent year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help him,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passed the torch to fellow golfer John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in the singles on Sunday.
“I feel an incredible pride, to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost his four games in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who has won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We’re going to come together, I’m going to collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we’re going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We have to bow down.
We overcame ourselves.”
Red Tide Info Point: Decline in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota Concentrations
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - leading to fears of declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
There are islets about 10 miles (16 km) off Hillsborough County, but at fewer sites than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at the bottom of Sarasota County or offshore, medium concentrations off Charlotte County and low concentrations off the bottom of this county.
Respiratory irritation persists in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation was reported in northwest Florida during the past week.
