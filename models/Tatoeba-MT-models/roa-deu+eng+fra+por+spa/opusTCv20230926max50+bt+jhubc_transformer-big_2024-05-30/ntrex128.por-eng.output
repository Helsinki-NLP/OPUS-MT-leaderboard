Members of the Welsh Assembly fear "passing through Hammers"
There is consternation on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) over the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Men of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy lies in plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, coming from all political backgrounds, fear that this will make them ridiculous.
A Labour MP said the group is concerned that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and "pwp" means "excrement".
An AM of Plaid said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a similar pronunciation to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave its assembly the powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received widespread support for the proposal to designate the assembly as the "Welsh Parliament".
On the question of the title of the MAs, the Commission favoured "Mrs of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the MAs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather consensus could be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way in which the Assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of MAs and the configuration of the commission system.
When debating the legislation, MAs will have the final say on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians vote to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which integrates a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a complaint about its territory, and has repeatedly objected to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite over the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no more than the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's Bells Shut Down as Harlem's Churches Fight for Survival
“From a historical perspective, the elderly people I spoke to told me that there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly head to.”
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of heritage will not last as long as the leaders hope "and that sooner or later everything will return exactly to the starting point".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the remaining neighborhood sanctuaries.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so this will hasten the day when these churches will all close, as most of those who move into these complexes are unlikely to join these congregations.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later taken over by a black congregation that held its services in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promoting black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, however, when plans were made for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the chime "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the chime in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
That expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said it was the first chime in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger chime at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin’s in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought in by the church’s lay leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it would "seek to pass on the costs" to it, despite the fact that it was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old At Lobster Dive In California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunting dive in California on the first day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy shouting for help, and then rowed toward him with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel stated that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but that he later realized that the boy was screaming "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The entire clavicle area was torn apart, Hammel described what he observed when he reached the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style cosmetics sections, supported by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn share in the UK cosmetics market, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion apparel and household goods decline, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out in more stores next year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the supermarkets’ search for ways to use the exhibition space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its range of beauty products by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also gain more space with brand areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products obey vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. The second, in Birmingham's Selly Oak, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and the shift from grocery shopping habits to small daily quantities in convenience stores have led supermarkets to now have to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the stores will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to battle discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores, and has also installed a number of Habitats since acquiring both chains two years ago, saying it has boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from health care stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more enjoyable environment.
We also invest in specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to adapt to every need. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible beauty outlet that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby quit <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby left an 11-million-pound deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's homeware and accessories brand.
Their business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she would be leaving the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons Den star Peter Jones livid by leaving the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (which could amount to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) meant she would no longer have time to devote herself to her Truly brand of household items and accessories.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's highest priority.
It would mean solving your long-term future and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely amazed.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that leaving the This Morning host, who is among Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, given the company’s huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for additional launch delays.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we do not intend to comment on his business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
The US president mockingly mentioned criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so long?
Trump said, in his voice pretending to be a “newspaper pivot.”
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, saying it would be a major step in North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North sees no "corresponding response" from the US to the first steps toward disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is pursuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of U.S. military personnel.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been evicted, it was not declared a national catastrophe, a prerequisite for the channelling of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been clear that they are not requesting international aid, so it becomes a bit difficult," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the wraths of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite the validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, travelling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who has made decrepit infrastructure improvement a central piece of his election campaign, has spent huge amounts on roads and railroads.
However, funding shortages have plagued Mr. Joko’s executive at a time when he faces his re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge makes a long shot to draw goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, with his team losing 1-0.
He tapped to his left before making a shot towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to reach that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving as far forward as possible, so I was just winning as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched him and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won 1-0 at halftime after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In that move, the Blues forward gave Mateo Kovacic a back heel pass before breaking off near midfield and sprinting towards Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick pass to midfield.
Then he made a nice shot that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the wide area.
He overtook the defenders and scored the goal against the second-beam net with a left-footed shot that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster response agency said earlier on Sunday.
There are reports describing a large number of people trapped in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during Friday’s 7.5-magnitude quake, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing woman to death
A murder investigation was initiated after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 a.m. with sharp gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged the people in the area who may have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who witnessed something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images with dash cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us as they may have crucial information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the scene to inquire about where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are currently informing close relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to access his apartment, but was told by police that it is forbidden to enter or exit the building.
When he was told what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being informed that they will only be able to return to their homes in hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly says, "It's so horrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the area immediately outside.
A number of police officers were deployed inside the cordon to guard the apartment building.
We ask those who have information to contact by DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers through the number 0800 555 111 indicating the record 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament became the latest monument swallowed up by the contention of "historical revisionism"
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, reminiscent of that perpetrated by the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell near the Palace of Westminster would become a target to shoot down.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than he is today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, from the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an entirely accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety who represents one side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and commemoration."
Pig Killer Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname “Yuan,” was found dead, with an artery cut off and covered in blood, near a poodle at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reads Sunday’s South China Morning Post.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring slaughterhouse.
In that dungeon, he said, was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing 227 kilograms, had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and crushed,” said the cousin, referred to by his nickname “Wu,” according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent it from attacking other people while police collected evidence at the scene of the incident.
Reports state that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to frighten the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as a “stimulus.”
"They're just kidding.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
All we have to do is show them respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains throughout the Mexican north and southwest of the U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa caused a Category 1 hurricane gust of 137 km/h, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical moisture northward in the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that point, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain could cause dangerous flash flooding, flooding of debris, and possibly desert landslides.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions is possible due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is highly discouraged to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
The heavy rainfall can cause the gorges to turn into raging rivers and the thunderstorms will bring strong point winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring with it heavy precipitation over parts of Southern California’s coastline.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause small runoffs of debris and slippery roads.
This could be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some tropical showers will begin to occur in Arizona scattered late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more dispersed late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
The month of October can register strong temperature variations throughout the US territory as the Arctic cools. However, the tropical zones will remain fairly mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences across the central U.S. zone on Sunday.
There is an almost 11-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
Much of the central and eastern part of the U.S. is expected to experience a warm start to October, with widespread temperatures between 27 and 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could hit 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. until the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations yesterday the sweeping testimony of Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with stations disrupting regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while drunk and tried to strip her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, the number Nielsen found on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring audiences of those who watch programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of audiences similar to the final of a football game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh’s nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long audience, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being verbally attacked by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator to address a Judiciary Commission hearing.
The senator stood motionless looking at the floor while being criticized live on CNN cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that “you have power while so many women have no power at all.”
Flake stated that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission went to vote to make Kavanaugh's nomination proceed to a plenary vote in the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee during the next week, something the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, as it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘making politics’ with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicizing" Britain's future and harming the national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the front page of the paper, its former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the minister’s “Chequers Plan” for Brexit, stating that a proposal that provides for Britain and the EU to cover the other party’s tariffs is “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police claiming that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had fatally shot Wayde with a firearm.
A bond of $350,000 has been established, the lawyer said.
The forensic office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound to the head that extended to the neck.
The department said the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police action group, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and area residents who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU’s athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the area authorities for their “diligence and effort to obtain justice.”
Sims was 20.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what worries us permanently,” Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano have hit neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and intervention police, as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, locked up by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually packed with tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which police resorted to sticks to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups chanting “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive” confronted unionist protesters, who shouted “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-leaning region, a year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout had been low, with a majority boycott of those opposed.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block ongoing voting at polling stations across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it was held, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they were able to vote, but now we are blocked,” he said.
Despite winning a vital but tangential victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police with his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s becoming more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year’s elections.
"Applying as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have witnessed on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car crash into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have fired a beast at the car.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, astonished the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second loss of only two in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made all the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changed levels, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which remains without an away win in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders with eight more points on Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their run of division-loss games to six games, with head coach Holt not losing a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against dull visitors
Holt’s team should have been ahead of the game long before the goal, as the incisiveness of his game was causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense but let himself be dragged in front of the goal and then Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his effort away after sneaking to find Craig Halkett's header over the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in the stalled ball plays.
And that’s how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the wide area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another Livingston standoff.
Crossings to the Livingston wide area continued to come, which were successively resolved, and two major penalty claims, one after Halkett's onslaught on surrogate Glenn Middleton and the other after one hand, were turned down by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving their best throughout the game.
In any case, the Rangers showed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
Their final play was uninspired (only once they managed to open the home team), constituting a kind of warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Received Ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside its country.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters made a presence in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist was killed in a runaway collision on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the person and inform their relatives.
Barriers and detours were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The riots, which are still continuing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m.
“Tornado” special agents have been summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to a ward.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Services spokesperson said: "Specially trained teams were used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin hosts more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought-affected areas may benefit)
A tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but it’s exactly what’s predicted for early next week, when the remnant energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for areas in southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rainfall.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state within a 300km radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those unaffected by the risks of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall can be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most severe category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the landmass crossing the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still hurricane-force Sunday morning, with winds at top speeds of 137 km/h, lies 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to hit the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at nightfall on Monday.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, raising a significant risk of flooding.
"Total precipitation of 8 to 10 mm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 25 mm," the website weather.com reported.
The Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then heading south into Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or its remnants is very high precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce sudden flooding and flooding of debris in the deserts, with risk of life, and flooding in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with sharp gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, near 4 a.m.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Agents have appealed to anyone who may have cellphone footage of the incident to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh "was a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the Democratic Party’s relentless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "was a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A confirmation vote from Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote from one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred sideways to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not competing, but I’m actually competing,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates.”
Trump has argued that Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; number continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, many of them dragged by the gigantic waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves up to six meters high slammed into the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation in their path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, having been victims of what happened," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman for mitigating the effect of the Indonesian disasters (BNPB), said in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not move on its own: it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive quake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings were found, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications "were totally incapacitated and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arose at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage posted on social media, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to the people down the street.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water crashed into the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuees still desperately need food and other staples.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the Palau evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is growing exponentially to more than 800.
It's really bad.
Although he managed to safely reach the town of Palu, where staff are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, Donggala’s World Vision staff went through scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even as relief groups began to begin the grim work of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign financing, supplies and personnel can only access the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still at a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says 'OK, this is a national catastrophe' we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist."
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that dampen the gloomy headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paraglider, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began circulating among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the Palu athletes, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark, rather than a pair of blues.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take USD 26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man “runned out behind the Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money that was destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West Changes Name to Ye
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The move comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons", said the creator of the show.
Being at the same time an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has for him a religious meaning, according to West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year when commenting on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"Therefore, I am you, I am us, it is us.
It comes from Kanye, which means “the one,” to just Ye – being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphens and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to resort to military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has pledged not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza “never to use the army to repress the Mexican people.”
The military fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a death toll that may have amounted to 300 as leftist student movements spread throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who study and opening more public universities.
The president said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. to double funding for artificial intelligence
At a time when China is stepping up its AI activity, the U.S. is expected to double research spending on AI, said investor and AI professional Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made announcements related to AI, even though the country does not have a formal global AI strategy.
In the meantime, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to lead AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubting the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so behind the US and we are on the lookout for the new AI revolution,” Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances of the next big success of AI being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello's top-ranked American player. Later, he held executive positions at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's China branch.
Lee credited previous U.S. government technology competitions as the Defense Department Agency’s Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. investigators often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is robbing academic leaders; it’s the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaires to work on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. give impetus to its AI efforts.
“I am of the opinion that green cards should automatically be awarded to AI doctorates,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States, however, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not progressed in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia," an initiative that would settle a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a complaint about its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether turnout will be enough to meet the 50% needed for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the admission efforts in bodies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The national election commission said there had been no records of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
“I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on changing the country's name, which would open the doors for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and putting chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up and not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
According to him, a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the necessary turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be greater than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major dilemma in the pro-Western government’s policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero crosses Brighton's entire defense towards goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling obliterated Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward was given a midfield pass at the start of the game.
He made a sprint between Brighton's three defenses before cutting to hit open ground.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He faked a defense before neutralizing in the race more others on the outskirts of Brighton's large area.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the wide area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with his right boot, defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with some foot problems,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League match.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball right in Brighton's territory on that play.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This one gave a few taps before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field.
City face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life harder for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there was not much reason to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final for the Rockies, who hold a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still have plans to secure their first division title.
“Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can get on the pitch knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level that I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in those conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting pitcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the pitches in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, made a session at the bullpen on Thursday and would pitch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right-hander from Washington goes with 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president referred sideways to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big...I’m not running, but I’m running and so I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates.”
Trump continued, “You’re seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re seeing it happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They don’t care who they attack, who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
“And they’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “aggressive, bad, sordid and liars.”
The president referred by name to Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, having received loud booing from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did it cause the document to leak?
Uh, uh, what?
No, um, no, I, wait, a--that was even bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant of those who openly give their opinion.
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it wasn’t a surprise to me.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour Members in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague Joan Ryan has been treated similarly because she has resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday mentioned that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were just that.
Unfortunately, today it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of “kinder and gentler” politics has long been forgotten, if ever come true.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because the colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political outlook began to expect me to take a turn and take positions that I would never agree with - whether they were on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn’t really matter what I say), there’s a torrent of insults on social media calling for “dismissal,” denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just me going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a dam of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back down in front of them.
One of the things that disappoints me most in this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or change of the selection rules the party narrows its views.
I have received countless advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, so as not to be so expressive, and that it would "be all right" for me.
But that's not why I came here to do politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my comprehensive school classroom literally in rubble, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as mayor or as minister in government.
I have never hidden my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused as to my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country heads for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow biased the result, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent’s Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without losses.
In the end, it was superior defense and better risk management that made the home team take the lead, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "The credit goes to Ayr. They handled the risks better than we do."
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a big penalty, before, just before halftime, he had scored and then converted a solo practice to put the score at 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long break followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was transported by stretcher to the outside and after the restart, Ayr reinforced the lead with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's incumbent captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted rehearsal by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense onslaught of pressure.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for taking down Climo without the ball, on the penalty kick, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind Ayr's progressing maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent the Gregor Henry wing to the fifth home team rehearsal.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the catering business
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game, looks set to enter the catering industry after being named director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, to be released soon, will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a source at the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan was intending to get involved in the "thriving Glasgow restoration business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a country devoid of coastline, hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rope-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings carry a navy blue flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes are perhaps at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the pronouncement of the ICJ’s sentence on giant screens scattered across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of their country’s claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday’s sentence.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” were the president’s votes last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even if it did not.
The U.N. body, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ sentence is handed down just six months after hearing the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have hurt it.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined some residual Chilean goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to deliver on the promises it made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival countries.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "impossible dream" to consider that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration putting an end to the Korean war would ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington fears accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant first steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are planning a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably views as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the runway a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which amazed the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide feather-like flap that flooded the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewellery-screened watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time for carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with a tube and glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue this immense fashion statement, you are in luck.
Styling observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent in the path of "La Bomba", the 61 cm-winged straw hat that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that spread through social networks sent another great creation to the runways: a beach bag in straw almost as big as the model in a swimsuit that carried it.
The rafia bag in burnt orange, adorned with rafia fringes and with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ spring-summer 2019 La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and beach bags hit stores next summer. Since the designer had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, and this trend continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further study and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a bespoke school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can get into his heart.”
This quote reminds us that we can’t just rely on English when it comes to building relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of recent exams this year, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum A rating.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of the students obtained the maximum grade of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will undeniably serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and beyond.
A survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that, among the reasons for employers’ difficulty filling vacancies, 17% related to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit ratio, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for children today.
Proficiency in several languages, particularly those in developing countries, will give children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Independent Scottish schools are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect this in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron starts for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is ending for fans who want to see LeBron James get his start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will participate in Sunday’s pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump begins a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the conformation vote on hold for his nominee for the Supreme Court seat, Trump intends to bolster support for the midterm elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week’s hearings to Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate’s planned confirmation vote will be on hold for a week as the FBI proceeds with investigations.
However, the main goal of this torrent of rallies is to help Republicans, who face a difficult election in November, gain some momentum.
President Trump’s campaign officials said the five rallies next week were intended to “energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and enlarge the majorities they hold in the Senate and House,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so fundamental to the president’s agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the campaign season’s turmoil,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening’s rally could attract supporters “from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get media coverage from the Pittsburgh area,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a hand in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday's singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of momentum is a totally invented sporting concept, but it is one that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is coming now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we're looking at that as a little bit of momentum, I'd say," Spieth said as he left the field at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those festive guttural screams were getting louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt that won the 15th match produced a similar scream, of the kind that reveals that he still believes that the American team remains in the competition.
“We just need to focus and worry about our own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, is four in four and can’t go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow to and from this turbulent crowd, it consolidates the idea that they are the players to hit on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated fourball hero Sergio Garcia this morning when teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine shoved the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close due to the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this session of foursomes also demonstrated that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a loose lead after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods struggling to make it to the four-point Le Golf National standings so far.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, struggling to retain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance on the foursomes with two games won, but failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points when he and Molinari, who were given the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are just the only duet to win four points in their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a powerless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, revealed occasional bouts of genius, but has already lost 19 of his fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always take the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the major men's tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duo scored a courageous 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team reversed a four-point draw before singles, although the title-holder Furyk team only needs to draw to retain the trophy.
After two days in second position, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says 'not to think' of unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were exacerbating distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons under the circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing center and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
“However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way we can disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri has recycled well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded as it takes gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant in that they do not reject unilateral denuclearization in a first place, in contrast to Pyongyang’s previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearizing the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, opposing until the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream for people who don’t know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of the sanctions is aggravating our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the interested party in this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that steering North Korea’s rockets toward U.S. territory was inevitable after “Bad President” Trump called Kim the “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a timetable for it, saying “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to strangle funding for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later declared that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, although North Korea later denounced him for “making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States “takes corresponding measures.”
Pompeo said Kim had told him the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were Trump’s security assurances in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the sexist culture of studying in caffeinated "directs".
One professor concluded that the students of this university at the top of the world rankings often did not have the slightest idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?'
The young woman stated that no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as we all have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “making direct” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we get enough sleep with quality should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid getting fat, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical biology and chemistry, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a campus-wide course, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program of study before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm when going to bed, as well as waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate the circadian rhythm and lead to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of grief away from home when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to lose 1-0 at Livingston Stadium.
The Ibrox team were looking to score their first win on the road since their 1-0 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up inflicting Gerrard's second loss in 18 games, leaving their team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the Scottish First Division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and the Rangers collective, devoid of inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With Rangers now dropping to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, and just behind Hibernian by the goal difference.
And even more trouble could arise for the Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence received treatment for a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that overtook Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, meanwhile, used the same Livingston eleven that stole a point from Hearts last week, and will have been delighted by the way his well-oiled team choked opponents every move.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored in the first two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his great opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot out towards the second beam.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have been given a big quarter-hour penalty with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused the Colombian’s appeals.
The Rangers only scored two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly’s header and Ovie Ejaria’s weaker shot.
Although Livingston’s 34th minute goal may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, let alone for its tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers could not cope with a long-stopped ball play by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the forward moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to effect the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long pass behind long pass.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the finals, but McGregor held up well, defending against Jacobs before Lithgow kicked out on the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton again claimed a major penalty when he got stuck on Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: On September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old and still counts ... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as a Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When we put these headphones on, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity on minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's really crackling now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that gave it its name still stands.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to ‘See’ Harmful Cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of various cancers", including those of the breast, ovary, lungs and also colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach that involves removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe in support of Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, stating that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began a brawl against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white man and he says, 'How can you like Trump? He's racist!'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star teased Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the scene of West's bravado was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They intimidated me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go over there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I’m marginalized,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying, "I would put on my superman cape, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try the love."
His comments provoked boobs from the audience and SNL attendees appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with someone from the show telling the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love It disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a show of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: "To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FACEING THE TURB."
However, talk show host Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying West was simply "being what it is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is welcoming and propagating ideologies harmful to the community.
He's free.
And we too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "the one formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg once used the name Snoop Lion, and of course the defunct music legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his fencing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, stating that such roles on screen make boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he has a "quite strong stance" on addressing the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal position right now: What went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he said, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, noting that for him, the "battlefields and the horses" are over.
Starting in November, Kit will participate in a reissue of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple tied the knot in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a shift from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual year-on-year variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90% of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised since 2003 universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leak of Republican senators by her colleague and attacks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information of three members of the U.S. Senate on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the charges were being promoted by opinion leaders and "ultra-right" websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with Waters’s office and published the data of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie," Waters said.
“My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by virtue of these fraudulent and false allegations, has had no responsibility in this leak.
This unsubstantiated accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is wrathful,” Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a Congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not his responsibility, he cannot get angry.
You can't take a challenging stance.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
It must reveal calm and serenity."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will run for Waters’ place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
“We assure that the culprits will be revealed and will be held legally accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Review Back to Attack - Poor Spy Movie Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavour, and this in fact seems to apply to the new edition in the comedy-action film series Johnny English, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satisfaction about the theme of being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his blunt eyes and an overly elastic expression obtained his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, above all, that it is a comprehensive comic creation aimed at non-English-speaking film lovers.
He is, of course, the dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to soft glamour, has a bit of cloiseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the movie "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the TV commercials for Barclaycard, which left chaos in its wake.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a chime against the helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for comedy is evident, but the humor sounds faint and strangely superfluous, especially considering that editions of “serious” films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that the humor is aimed at children and not adults, and in my opinion Johnny English’s bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film numbers in Bean’s character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the dismay of the service agent, a woefully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicted figure, already suffering a total outburst of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Her secret service advisers inform her that once all the agents in the asset have been compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
And that someone is the clumsy Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a fancy school, but giving unofficial lessons on how to be an undercover spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his long-suffering auxiliary Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, an insidious character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Batman and Robin of the Catastrophe in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, taking on the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd clumsy acts: disguised as waiters, set fire to a showy French restaurant, create confusion by penetrating the luxury yacht of Volta as smugglers, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of the house of Volta.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but as friendly and stormy as it is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And just like in the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but ask: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to her talent?
Workers deny they are engendering a plan for Britons to work four days a week, but getting five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide Britons with a four-day workweek but five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants bosses to pass on savings with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by granting them an extra day off.
Workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping it in order.
Sources say the idea would “adjust” to the party’s economic program, which reorients the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day workweek got the backing of the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: “We look forward to announcing a policy review before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration adjusted to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, this aspiration is not currently favoured by the entire Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: “The four-day workweek is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of “faceless directors” and “speculators” of basic services firms.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the entire share of the current shareholders of water companies, given that the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illicit conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to put workers on the company’s boards of directors and create Inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the private companies’ share to employees, who can pocket dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their minds or not
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could figure out something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I was going to the hearing," he said, "I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unmistakable.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
“I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be necessary,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentioned couldn’t confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an extremely impressive roster of stars who will perform on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to Central Park’s Great Lawn, not only to attend performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) spectators had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful ways that contribute to raising awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of “clickivism” – do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters who have lobbied to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to world leaders having announced commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, with at least $10 billion of them already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which has pledged to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition ambassador, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions of pressure on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the site’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responds: “It’s been a long, tortuous path – sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy as 'Block' to Barrier Russia's Energy Exports - Home Secretary
“If necessary,” Washington can resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, particularly where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to intermediate energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability, with its navy, to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, to put in place blockades to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are indeed the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick magician" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to boost natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inadequate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream pipeline, intended to double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s zealous opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic motives, an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply examine" whether she can run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “deeply examine” the possibility of running for president following the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the ultimate leader,” she said.
"After November 6, I will look deeply into the possibility of running for president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s constituents themselves are not of the opinion that she should run for president in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe’s Center for Political Research.
32% support your candidacy.
The poll showed superior support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to The Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's post-traumatic stress at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through after I’m back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the wounds our soldiers do come back with,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "come back a little different, come back hardened, come back asking if there is this respect for what their comrades soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, have given to the country."
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence over a woman and possession of a gun while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district sent an amicus curiae statement on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy was not disclosed.
The person claimed that her partner “and her children, members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. authorities dismissed her asylum application on July 20.
The plaintiff was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Resource Council that allowed undocumented immigrants who had escaped domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle,” the statement reads.
The lawyers also argued in that statement that police banning immigrants from entering negatively affects the U.S. economy, noting that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “avail the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in a time trial to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, 35, mother of a feverish male baby, comforting him at an evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured his ribs and shoulder, rested outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to the strong aftershocks that continued.
His eyes were soaked in tears as he recounted how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Intimidation' with 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily’s paid supplement to the Des Moines Register, the state’s highest-rated newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 congressional elections, an accusation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in statements to Reuters, have designated as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish trade-promoting announcements, Beijing and Washington are now waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff waves on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliation tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now setting foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press.”
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s cherished tradition of free speech and the press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“On the other hand, in the stands here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinions that the Chinese may have about the worrying economic trajectory of their country, as the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterms with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many prominent Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this could elicit a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions surrounding the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward to a vote.
These things have no backwards,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in a paper published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Sen. Jeff Flake's last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is on the doorstep!” as they rallied in the Senate lobby as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move ahead with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will break all records,” said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation.
“People say she’s already tall; it’s true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge, it’s also about how Republicans handled the issue and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority aligning with the former.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41 percent of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh had likely or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI began an investigation into Ford’s allegations as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford reported under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually molested her as an alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court appointee exposed his genitals when the two were attending a party during their time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
It allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse,” or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data warehouse is that it is solely up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: tribute to cleric decorated with the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only clergyman in the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the decoration on 29 September 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren unlocked a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the feat that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns".
He then ran to the line of fire and, "with the utmost courage", led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shooting down three soldiers of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never match, but also a lesson in humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people".
Mixed martial arts fans waking up all night to see Bellator 206 watch instead Pig Peppa
Imagine this: you stay up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of stars and, in the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 fights, with six from the main group, and was being broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the showdown, spectators in the UK were amazed when the cover shifted to Porca Peppa.
Some were not impressed after being awake until dawn especially for combat.
A Twitter fan described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad-tasting joke.”
“Government regulation says the content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to another schedule,” said Dave Schwartz, an administrator with marketing and communications oversight, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pussy Peppa, yeah."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said the company would rectify the broadcast schedule to include UK spectators in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock on Sunday morning there and we won’t be able to solve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I’m not lying when I say that when the schedule changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem. We thought it was a technical error.
But it was not: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed fan expectations and we overreacted.
It is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'inferior' to his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley stated that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that this gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with Radio 4's first ever Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said she was in favor of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The show's longtime regular host, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
“Until today, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and strength to achieve success.”
His goal was to prove he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and has used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "took me by surprise."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, 20 years his senior, although he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When we go through so much when we are so young" - his first participation in the Olympics was at 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a child last year in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "their whole outlook" had changed.
“If they had asked me last year, all that mattered was winning a gold medal,” he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the London games in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you’re not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I was fully aware that that was what I had dreamed of my whole life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics... there was no better feeling,” he said.
All of this was also the inspiration for his first choice of song - Heather Small's "Proud" - with which he had identified during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson down on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to regain his form to stop the milestone from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record number of entries, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often been on the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the men’s main championships split the day between supporting and working in his game on the field, hoping to rectify what ails him.
Having never taken the right shots even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf Nacional course, where the long rough usually punishes the errant shots.
And if the field alone wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point draw to start the 12 singles matches, score a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said it would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a respected champion who has given so much to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably didn't expect to see him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to move on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matched the successes of your individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and witty, he likes to play with people and he’s a great person to have in the team room,” he said.
“I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to watch.
He gives so much more than just playing.”
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage could disappear in no time.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his loose lead on entering the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily become a rugged ride.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the nose with the narrowest of margins, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by little," Bjorn said in the image, after watching the 2018 Class win 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go in there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the scoreboard.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should stay.
I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is individual performance and that involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they’re going to abandon their partner and he has to go and do his best as well.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big turns on the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before finally losing when Europe took the "Miracle in Medinah" out of the hat.
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When that impetus is headed to one side, the pressure is very great in these midfield matches.
We organized our staff accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we’re going to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the ordering.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers the entire route,” Bjorn said of his singles choices.
New German warship postponed once again
The latest German navy frigate should have entered service in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships. However, it will have to wait at least until next year, due to fault-prone systems and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the navy in 2014, but disturbing post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the navy had ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance, which would allow the most recent frigates to be sent on missions lasting a maximum of two years away from their home ports.
However, continued delays have meant that with state-of-the-art warships, seen as a way for Germany to project power across borders, they will already be outdated when they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a number of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would render the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the contingent required in the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the navy’s ability to install additional functionality in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, an increase from the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems plaguing the most recent frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being deployed.
The politician stated that the problem grew exponentially over time, as older ships were put out of service without vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had been able to join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research is underway on a property in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as long-eared browns and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations scattered throughout the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland breeding, as well as how best to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development works that affect the dormitories and make the habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning are also a threat, along with fly killer papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo tracking technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly carry out studies, inspections of dormitories and sometimes rescues.
He also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have an excellent bat area,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there’s still a lot about bats that we don’t know about, so the work we’ve done here and on the other properties will help us know more about what they need to bloom.”
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance on the properties, because the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their dorms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to attend to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don’t know how their populations are getting revenge.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "fake news", claiming that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he then paid $375 000 to the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, reads Friday's Der Spiegel.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, characterized the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy home and it’s okay,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they characterized as “an inadmissible account of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
"Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99%" "a good guy", hurt by the "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also alleges that she addressed police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to enter into an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now says she intends to cancel the deal as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged assault. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘would regret forever’ losing car manufacturers
Britain would “repent forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stoppages at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border transactions work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what the manufacturers claim are the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU, for cars manufactured to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disturbances at the border, which the sector says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said May's "Chequers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the seizure by us of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Although it could not give an estimate of downtime, Toyota said that, in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and could sooner or later lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union there, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed another week" as there is still no understanding as to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The fact that Trump may be preparing to fire the deputy attorney general, thus putting Mueller’s independence at risk, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of covertly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not to fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it may also be postponed for another week, in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
We'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with such a statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonism."
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president has more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We've looked at these numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this often and they have seen that we have done it in the last few weeks. The fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences, while receiving foreign representatives.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way before the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to fund applications for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, with decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this moment how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Tigers' Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ said.
Tennessee coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
"He approached the sideline and practically fainted," Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff put Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before lying him on a stretcher and transporting him for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type/severity of the injury" and that the team is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
A higher stamp tax will be levied on foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp duty on foreign buyers acquiring properties in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract younger voters
The seal tax hike will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher seal tax rate will be levied on foreign buyers acquiring properties in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract younger voters, with promises to provide more affordable housing and tax higher incomes.
The seal tax hike will hit people and businesses that are not taxed in the UK, with additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to offer a roof over the homeless.
The surcharge — added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and lease purchases — could amount to three percent.
The Finance Ministry expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are acquired by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a seal tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by hoarding land they do not use, demanding that Mrs May abandon quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “housing misfortune.”
Mr. Corbyn announced an eye-catching package of housing reform proposals, including rent checks and an end to “unjustified” evictions.
It also wants to give the municipalities extended powers for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I stated that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy homes for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for resident British workers.
For too many people the dream of owning their home has become too distant, and the shame of sleeping in the shadows remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his "last-ditch ambition" is to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old Scot has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the Northeastern club, currently third in the First League, three points from the lead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after coaching St. Mirren on their return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got one B internationalization,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound program.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my dad and these are some of my best memories.
But that opportunity will only arise if he succeeds in managing clubs.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he was not afraid to succeed such established names at such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, at the moment the success comes down to ‘can I bring the club back to the Premier League?’
"Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League."
"It will not be easy to take the club back, but I will only consider that I have been successful here when I reach that goal."
Ross' coaching career is only three years old, after a stint as an assistant coach for Dumbarton and 15 months on the technical team for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of relegation to the championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself more in the role of a coach than in the role of a player.
It seems strange because it went well, I made a living as a player and had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressures of the position, but I feel very good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heatwave filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Catering groups posted a 2.7 percent growth in sales in July, but restaurant occupancy fell 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: “The continuation of England’s good weather and career at the World Cup, longer than expected, caused the June standard, when pubs saw 2.8% growth in sales, to repeat itself in July, but restaurants saw a decline.
The 1.8% drop in catering sales in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with the beverage-based business performed by far the best, with a year-on-year growth that more than offset the decline in restaurants.
Pubs with the meal-based business also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of catering operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent over the month, with meals down 3 percent.
Paul Newman of RSM, an analyst in the leisure and catering sectors, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events remain the main factors influencing the sales of the out-of-home food market.
It is not surprising that restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is especially damaging when added to the prolonged cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators with the meal-based business. Only time will tell if the milder temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desired relief."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral sales indicator for British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hides secret social media accounts from their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts they hide from parents and teachers, a study has found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of “fake” pages on Instagram
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students said they own a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — create social media accounts they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake” accounts on the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they own an innocuous “main” account to show their parents while simultaneously owning private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found that the teenager incited others to “rape” her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of whom admitted to owning private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘voice of the athletes’ at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the Regulator's annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland’s most medal-winning athletic practitioner. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sport regulators to leverage her vast international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletics will have much to gain from her presence on the Council,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and I hope I can truly contribute to helping guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic stroke.
As he wrote on Twitter: “Today it’s been a month since I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk anymore.
The doctors said only time would tell if he could recover and to what extent.
It has been a painful job but I have achieved a total recovery, relearned to walk and even do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Milk pump ad compares mothers to cows, splitting opinions online
A dairy pump company has split opinions online with an ad comparing mothers who nurse cows in milking.
To mark the launch of what’s described as the “first portable silent milk pump,” consumer tech company Elvie has released an ironic ad inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom the new pump confers on mothers who pump milk.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled vacancy to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The refrain goes on: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, I'm milking my girls."
However, the announcement posted on the company’s Facebook page has sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it alleviates the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born.”

Another commented: “Understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise an extraction pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad as a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but it makes perfect sense.
This product is brilliant,” one of the women wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump milk (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like “cows.”
It’s not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who pump milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies and even leave the house while they are pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative release.
By drawing a parallel between women who pump milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of pumping milk, while presenting it in a fun way that people can identify with the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new pump.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Discreetly Displaced to a Texas Border Camp
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most "godfathers" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults in their households would have to register their fingerprints, and the data was shared with immigration regulators.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the service detained dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
“About 80% of the godparents or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals," Albence said.
Seeking to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to report to court within one month of the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, according to officials at the shelters.
Many are present by videoconference, and not in person, to defend their claim for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for aid shall be expelled promptly.
The longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to staff at the shelters and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the large size contributes to children’s signs of disturbance being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria Demands Immediate Withdrawal of US, French and Turkish 'Occupation Forces'
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s war in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, in a war that still left millions displaced.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions for their return were secure, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led to refugees staying abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement set "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, setting the stage for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the impeachment and scandals end his presidency early.
In what would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from the spectators.
Since 2014, prime time audiences more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"This is a strong appeal to people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor," about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He recalls once calling a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Naturally, unlike television shows, stories from Washington could determine the future of abortion legislation, the right of immigrants to family reunification, and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, it’s more than just being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of an expert debate about Bob Woodward’s use of “in-depth knowledge” sources in his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment full of insolence,” as the Washington Post has pointed out) and the implications of the President’s...
I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of what he’s done feels like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s dynamic cast and the daily twists of the plot.
We can't miss a single episode or we're left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was not distracted by television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate Justice Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all."

Significant external funding in the midterm elections for the House of Representatives
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th Circle is experiencing an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of electoral circles that left two incumbents running for the same spot.
The recent readjustment of Pittsburgh suburban circles put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb runs against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that old circles favored Republicans unconstitutionally.
The race for the 17th circle sparked a bitter campaign funding dispute between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely contested March Extraordinary Elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That place had been occupied for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to the Democrats.
U.S. Considers Penalizing El Salvador for Supporting China
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from management.
State Department officials decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for controlling drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With the continuation of the internal meetings, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to move forward, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be dropped could be Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, about which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will allegedly be directing his investigation to ascertain whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to attack the election.
Should Congress change hands, Trump will face accountability from that body as he prepares to run again to voters and perhaps be tried by his peers.
It’s a lot of hypotheses, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – not even that of his European counterparts.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points such as this, at which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
Americans are currently facing several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the Times news is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s newly requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she had me light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of game with Vienna Rapid
The Rangers host the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will leave them in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until a two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use that result as a springboard for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We looked at the game with a positive mindset and won a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end but, overall, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first half but we turned around and dominated in the second half.
Thursday will be another great European night.
It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure that we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year has been very tough, with all my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success.”
Women Are Losing Sleep Afraid of This Savings-Retirement Account
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they want to receive, few people have spoken to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children on the same subject.
“People want a family member to look after them, but they’re not having that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you let them know your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your continued care funding choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid monetary valuation policy to help cover those expenses, or funding using your own savings, as long as you have those amounts available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney, choosing a person of your trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the constitution of a power of attorney over your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for you, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you know how to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan.”
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure on his way home from a night in the city.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries were not life-threatening and police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications interrupted, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with lower administrative status than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude quake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a Wasilla, Alaska resident, was detained on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took away her phone.
Palin is in pre-trial detention in Mat-Su, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three Class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B felony, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a gun under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans’ associations for associating her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died in the aftermath of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake hit the Central Sulawesi region, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social networks showing the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York
The New York Public Prosecutor’s Office is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack that killed eight people in the city — a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a bike lane on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and inflicted "intentionally" serious injuries, according to the death penalty notice, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punishable by the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder in the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “considerable planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed him as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South Zone of New York hasn't asked for the death penalty for an indictment in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had been inspired to carry out the attack after seeing videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s defense lawyers, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life imprisonment confession with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the accusers not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit talks
Nigel Farage has vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at the Conservatives’ congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Rear-level Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK “would have left already” if Farage had been Brexit minister.
But May’s challenge to reconcile her deeply divided coreligionists has been underscored by the Conservatives who have organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been debating whether to stick to her compromise plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, supporters of permanence and the EU.
Allies insist she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan."
Bone suggested that responsibilities should have been assigned to Farage in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have left by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.”
Reinforcing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone has rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to remain is totally out of place.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the rally, telling reporters: “I’m just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular with our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Only prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are prepared to betray the decision taken out of the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want to put pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing United Kingdom.”
However, supporters of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A crowd of activists held up banners with the message "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticised the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
“It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology ready for ‘Canada more’, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete hoax.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren Plans to ‘Seriously Ponder’ Possible Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously weigh the candidacy for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that he may face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump’s inauguration.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time "for women to go to Washington to fix our government's problems and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims of the LSU Tigers
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to his presence at the scene, wielding a gun, acknowledging that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-metre junior raised in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and started 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 wins per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following orders from the team
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first at the pits and caused Hamilton to have to face traffic from the end of the peloton, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track free, at risk of disqualification after a double correction of trajectory to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left the last row of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap, on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tires too late, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the pits on lap 44 but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman, letting me overtake him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions,” Hamilton said.
Bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she failed to reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, instead commenting that what’s going on in the Senate shows that people are “bad, malicious and false.”
“Look at the beautiful thing that’s going on in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, look at how bad and malicious and false people are,” Trump said.
“When we see the leaks and the press releases and when they say ‘oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape come from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no, no, no.
The escape did not leave me.'
Well, wait a minute.
The escape left us... No, it wasn’t us,” she added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "You know what, that was bad body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges in his favor.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see evil, malice, it doesn’t matter who they can hit, who they have to step on to take power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from Friday's loss in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second leg 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants had an initial two-goal lead with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald secured the team's victory.
It was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had managed a turnaround on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frantic first period, Sullivan put the home team back into play at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt tied Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants reached the first lead break, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after dying by ensuring a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to plague the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the town of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post while the control tower was shaking violently at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained focused to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower in the face of the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television network ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
However, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, the country's disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing as there are many bodies buried in the rubble that we have not yet been able to rescue," Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
Lack of drinking water.
Minimarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces at the site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Earlier this year, the Indonesian island of Lombok was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports now that there is a man missing after plane crash in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after it reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had not been able to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The company said it was collaborating with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all with a stable clinical condition.
It is not yet known for certain what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the runway and docked in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had left the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming too low.
“It was the best thing that ever happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others had been able to crawl the water around their waist and get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on a nearby dock upgrade also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst Explains Chronology of Events of the Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
The indictment concluded its allegations on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cellphone records to reconstruct the movements of the 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several cell phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting statements she had previously made.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency in Tellis's testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Cell records indicated they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“You wiped her out of your life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin filing its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be reviewed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip hop has strayed from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to those roots and return the popularity to conscientious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent revival in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York nanny sues couple for firing via 'racist' text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received an SMS message from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denied accusations of racism, saying the lawsuit was an act of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed some fear when she discovered that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she showed up for her first day at work in 2016.
“I CAN’T BELIEVE... ANOTHER BLACK,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she noticed her gaffe, an "embarrassed" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice alleging the poor performance of the previous African-American nanny and that she was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one-day job and sent home from Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and asking for a dismissal compensation of $350/day for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
“I want to show them that they can’t go unpunished,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent him something she didn't really want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would your children entrust someone they've treated badly, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
Nicknamed the “extortion” process, Plasco said his wife had been a mother for only two months and had to deal with “a very difficult situation.”
"Are you going to chase someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
While the legal process proceeds, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun to find out now, after Paddington has been so successful.”
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little toy bear writing the children's book, would not have taken it to heart if the book had been rejected, adding that the publication's 60th anniversary had a bittersweet taste given his passing last year.
About Paddington, who described him as "a very important member of our family," he said his father was very proud of the success he had achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to boastfulness," he said.
“But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we were proud even when the feat is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Although it was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on my phone.
Shortly after landing, the daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“Nad would often call to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
"So Nad called and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medicines that doctors had given him to keep his heart working were slowly ceasing to work and leaving his system.
He had been dead for some time and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stand there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers outside the trial she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
"I always cried with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning post cards on bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide fight to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to get support.
Sharon Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to have to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, a Lydney resident, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it would light up the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had "immersed himself in darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible repercussion."
Sharon Davis created the postcards “so they know there are people who are available to help and who they can talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't shut yourself up. You have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after her mother-in-law died.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a rag. When the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "It wrecks a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as FBI investigation begins
“I thought that if we looked like what I asked for — an investigation with a time and scope set — we could get closer together,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “collapsing” in the face of a deep-rooted partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is a merely temporal matter.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, Republicans fail, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court thwarted.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to launch the tiebreaker vote and confirm his place on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean Deserters Declines During Kim's Regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defections last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as people smugglers asking for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public statement.
As a rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean defectors.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the defectors to be illegal emigrants and not refugees, and it is frequent to repatriate them.
Relations between North and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the deadlocked denuclearization talks.
The talks came after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed to broadly collaborate on the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in the House, said Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would soon be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations of sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotionally open statement, sometimes in a loud, sobbing voice, about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly accused the committee’s Democrats, dubbing the allegations made against him of “grotesque and conspiratorial murder” by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he is ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court given his biased behavior against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's effective nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you are not eligible to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. District Relations Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she feared potential opinions from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given his reputation as a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the possibility of overturning certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision,” Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control their emotions.
It’s a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and you can’t vent without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
A woman with an executive position in some company helped me a lot. She told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she had created a technique. When she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it went on.
And I thought to myself... it’s brilliant,” Ms. Steinem continued.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in a male-dominated office where I cried with inexpressible anger, being grabbed by the neck by an older woman - an unfriendly manager who terrified me a little - and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they’ve been able to affect you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and resigned his candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder didn’t see why she couldn’t run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who nicknamed the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late entry, the fundraising was below desirable and he swore that he would only enter the race if he managed to raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, even though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
“Do you think I’m entitled to a discount?” he asked.
When she announced she wasn’t going to enter a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top — gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and getting the message out to voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism — and tears popped up.
“She even seemed to be depressed,” Patricia Schroeder recalled as she spoke of the media’s reaction.
“I would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
What would you write on my epitaph?
"She cried?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Benefit Beijing
The first salvo of the trade war between the U.S. and China has been deafening, and while the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of experts, the separation of the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week saw a significant worsening of the situation with new taxes affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods shipped by China to the U.S.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 percent to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to falter in the near future.
To push Washington back would mean succumbing to demands, but to show public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“In reality, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could have ever anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Ready for Refugee Return
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European national team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive losses on European soil since the last time it won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is once again victorious after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who has shown to have serious difficulties during most of the tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst-ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain’s Sergio Garcia became the most awarded European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit to cry, but today I couldn’t contain myself.
It's been a tough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said after Europe’s victory.
Pass the word to compatriot Jon Rham who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in the singles on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high caliber performance throughout the tournament, the rest of the U.S. national team struggled to make it to the fairway.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear in Europe.
We fought.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and I will collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like a lot of these 12 players and I’m proud to be their captain.
I have to take my hat off to the other team.
They were better."
Red Tide Update: Concentrations Decline in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
