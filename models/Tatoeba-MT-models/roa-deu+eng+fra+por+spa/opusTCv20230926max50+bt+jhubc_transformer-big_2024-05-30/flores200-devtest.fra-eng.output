The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the Olympic family’s absolute need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization rather than revoking accreditation.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal’s plumage was brownish on the top and pale in color or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also makes it possible to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, called the spine, but nevertheless show other characteristics specific to feathers – beards and beards – the researchers deduced that the spine was probably a later evolutionary development to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for regulating or displaying temperature.The researchers suggested that even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists say it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and consists of a large number of small particles.

“They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.”
“Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the planet’s large caves that maintain a constant temperature, but they resemble each other in that they are deep holes in the earth,” said Glen Cushing, a crew member at the USGS and staff at the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a booth, putting in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each step of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

In the category of women in seated skiing, four skiers failed to finish their course; as for the giant slalom, 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in this race failed to rank.
Police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop.”
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said the accused had their faces concealed when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The lane where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been indicted for the murder of her son by Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised as her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have found the publication of photos to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that “journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects.”
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a five-year term.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Head of Park and Heritage Conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were duly trained and trained in safety guidelines.
Martelly inducted a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at putting the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly’s response to the vast protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of defective iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to these aircraft.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as “non-serious.”
The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six of them have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his spare time.
Her research has shown that if a hormone is given, it will accelerate the baby’s lung maturation.
The Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or “black boxes”) on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... even more so... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections found that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, which were prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors “political gossip and nonsense.”
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technologies, not previously used ground-based radar systems, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transportation is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and relay parks are not available on the ground.
Fear of the lack of transport created the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the fans of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the genesis of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following breeding between an endemic Darwin’s finch, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-billed immigrant finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be drawn in fine yarn, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued on another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in the pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women met.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought us is to have made transportation much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are more medium-sized felines that eat also medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-living pet cats) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lion cubs.
Women are usually very close to each other, their family being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Troops of lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes hard), swim, jump large distances, and tow with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the broad roar of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be screams and roars.
Ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to the scientists, ocelots track and find the animals to eat (preys) by smell, sniffing their path on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots chase their prey by melting in their environment before throwing themselves on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothing from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing except the other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were endowed with more than 70 sharp razor blade teeth, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had a split tongue, his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not of any stature against him.
Although the Romans consumed food that we know of, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails as well as laurel, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the dwelling of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary that only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street; the houses were built of stone.
As there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and named it so — by traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Treasure of the Templars, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" can be found at the bottom of the document, backwards.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (measuring about 29 inches three-quarters by 24 inches) was rolled into storage.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting him.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term “civilization” is derived from the Latin word “civilis”, which means civil and is related to the Latin words “civis”, which means citizen, and “civitas”, which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or those on customs duties between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended, and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and it won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators who passed through it mentioned it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Hall.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the photographic sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it is quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (family of APS formats, for example) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The very ill-treated and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple directive that promotes dynamism while at the same time offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s money funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international law and codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire sea areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic aroused only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction in the face of its boundless submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wished to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable age of divided provinces; the best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era which took place for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of Chinese Antiquity. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues that went beyond the framework of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not at all easy to find, even if you know it exists. When you enter the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above, you can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Cheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The “push” symbol resembles a V and the “pull” symbol resembles a staple or square with the lower side missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the up (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow up generally produces a softer sound, while a bow down is louder and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to register your own marks in pencil, but do not forget that the printed bow marks are for a musical reason, and that they must therefore generally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of saleswomen.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd held up the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental advantages of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe running from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the Upper Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense whereby the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself proceeds according to a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care techniques for treating bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography would have appeared, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders came back loaded with gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries.
In the beginning, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western modes could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the era, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a severe intellectual or physical impairment of the child.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When fully bred by non-human species, wild children exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical disposition) almost identical to those of the animals that bred them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a way to help learners who are discovering a new teaching such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone of Microsoft Office is one too.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult for the student alone to manage.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Host family placement is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered major factors in promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President’s Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain injury are nonetheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities for interpreting human behavior may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of the expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination cause variations between the two basins to alternate with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth impairment, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” a bit in the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent alarm clock, so that you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known to be diuretic), forcing you to wake up to urinate.
A person’s degree of inner peace opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real clashes, through alternative armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and assets, while interfering with your enemy’s ability to move his people and assets.
One of the most notable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans attempted to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by goats who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the better known term shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were simply parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and pull higher loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The crossings were introduced early enough to keep the runways in place, but it was gradually realized that the runways would be more effective if they were fitted with an iron strip on top.
This has become common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans started walking on their feet two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even militate in order to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment, however, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away, to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July, and a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document; the original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have scaled legs and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects very suitable for parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs, like bed bugs, are nidicoles, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in that of the child, to take care of the upbringing of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but that also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people wishing to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of activities on site.
For example, you can go to see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns by car to go to their workplace and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a passenger car-based transport system and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability that has sustained human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers can not be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape their enemies and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City draws up its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since ancient times, peoples have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was about the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that the latter are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys are also found which comprise a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing modes has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb operates on the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's like climbing a hill on a heavy cart, splitting the core again, then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "the right buddy" (or the right girlfriend).
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting assessments, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she has to change everything the group has created so far and do things his/her way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to dissensions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can come together based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members is accountable. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to impose the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization’s functional services, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer’s need.
Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the scope of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, tumors and trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and hardware to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted as science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research aims at the automation by machines of tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the problems of daily life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been put into place in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is brought by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at antique objects from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but older versions are kept online as an album.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often try to experience blogging with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "compels students to learn more about the world around them" and the need to engage the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used appropriately, blogs ""can help students build their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and present their own views on specific topics"" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and boasts a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings which possess unspoilt natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners see as Canada's quintessence.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a population comparison that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent in itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not seem too valuable.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider harassment, as it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing male advances, and don’t be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and christened it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and trinkets of all kinds, but that’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma needs to be researched to understand the state of the fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for mountain gorilla trail treks among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates's "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, from Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, which is divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific fauna.
It is one of the best known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It can be advantageous to get a Wild Card that gives access to certain South African parks, as well as all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draw the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon waterfront located opposite.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the landfills of the north shore.
This is the place that the British settlers invested, so it seems to me to be a good place to start, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only made up of mangrove swamps; they also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered with water/swamp areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a cable-stayed bridge overlooking the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay, once nicknamed “the giant province of the Indies”, was born from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo courts.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only island bank located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currencies may be. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands money outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Montevideo being located in the south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than the thermometer says.
There are not really “rainy” and “dry” seasons: rainfall is roughly constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, the bison, moose, elk, bear, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular ones are in three zones.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow for safe bathing, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the “Number One”, a fairly ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the “Manta”.
There are plenty of French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips on the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay special attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries, and can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would stray away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is found in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport shuttle service or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They may also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or get you other necessary documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests must, however, be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the music event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed campsite.
Remember that even though the music shows are finished on the main stages, other music shows can continue until late at night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed huts.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are rarely found there, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment in order to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them on the spot.
On some sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone travelling by car to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall in a very short time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or dust, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most striking moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion to African land, and in particular to the savannah, with the aim of witnessing the striking spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called “bushwalking”, “pedestrian safari” or “jogging”) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can make it easier to dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if there aren't any in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you find one.
Avoid not letting the fabric overheat (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil the water for one minute; in others, it must be done for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they do not know about in their region of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are pretty good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common here: apples are cooked and baked in pastry all year round, while cherries and plums point the tip of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of tight coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be “solid” or “liquid,” depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands in Indonesia, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without other qualifiers, it tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors that Javanese prefer being peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the feet of the rider, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: indeed, the user's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth, fairly narrow heel and sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – Chile’s top climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the tops of the mountains, the panoramas of the mountains are breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new paths that can be made on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called “ski bums”, who organize their entire holidays based on skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings showing skiers date back to 5,000 BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski hiking: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine-type hiking skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to travel distances a little longer than on foot – but you’ll rarely reach cross-country ski speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, so under conventional circumstances, travelling across multiple countries requires multiple visa applications and multiple passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the space, which saves time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition for whether a manufactured object is an antique; some tax agencies define property over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on where you are located; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than that in Europe.
Craft products can be considered antiques, even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer farming is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Samis were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, they lived on fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as traction animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.

Opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and overly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social upheaval or loss of life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea thunderstorms and cyclones.
Extreme regional and seasonal weather events include cold storms, snow storms with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to inquire about the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination region, knowing that this may have an impact on the itineraries they are considering.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An internet search for "Course in hostile environment" will likely provide the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues covered here in much more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
Training normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning a sex change operation abroad must ensure that they have valid documents in their possession for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue non-sex passports (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
Security checkpoint searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Transgender people in the preoperative phase should not expect to pass the scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Ripping currents are currents that return from waves that break on the beach, often on a rock or equivalent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid current to the deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, getting back to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be caught again. It is also possible, that depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for rescue.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have struggled to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to re-adapt to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
At first, when you were traveling abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country have to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, we always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, and King George Island, along with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: the island of Livingston and the Deception, where the caldera flooded by a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountain Range, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, comprises the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote places, without a cellular network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, because you have to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local carrier should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this possibility.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, because it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, taking sabbatical courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your country.
As a rule, you have to pay a registration fee to follow these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don’t necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually big enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the seashore and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
We should not be ashamed of it: it is no different from the personal fears and fears that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Transport companies are well-paid for fast deliveries, and often, in urgent repairs, the issue of timeliness is crucial for related documents, merchandise or spare parts.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to pass unloading and customs.
The only way to get it to you faster was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that is where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better yet, ask your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no need to seek discounts for business class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that they can rely on a certain type of traveller who is willing to pay dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their rates in an informed manner.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no member country of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Remember that you are visiting essentially a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still many living women and men who have survived their stay here, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as the law states that it is the first official language.

Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.

As light pollution in their time was not as worrying as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the nearby aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even “one.”
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, taking “specimens” will also get you expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive.

All the animals that arrived on these islands originally did so by water, swimming or aboard floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance that separates them from the mainland, mammals have not been able to get to the end of the trip, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to admire the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day.
As the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than the one to which Westerners may be accustomed.
Costumes are classic work outfits, and employees are called by family name or function.
