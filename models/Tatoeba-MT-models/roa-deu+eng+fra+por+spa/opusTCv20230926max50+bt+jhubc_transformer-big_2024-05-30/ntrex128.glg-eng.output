Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned "that they take them for puppets"
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, now called AM, over the suggestion that they should change their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose from plans to change the name of the assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly across the board fear being ridiculed.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "dumb" and "pwp" means "poop".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but pointed out that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed strong support for the designation of Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the AM title issue, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
The AMs seem to be suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could turn out to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules of disqualification of the MAs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when debating legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells remain silent as Harlem’s churches continue to fight
“The elders I spoke to said that before there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Today, neither one thing nor the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars had disappeared.
“People now socialize in different ways,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from asset sales will not last as long as the leaders expect, and "sooner or later they will go back to where they started".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of full owners of the kind of people who would not help keep neighborhoods sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of the people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white,” he declared, “and therefore will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of those churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took up the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the stores on 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street that resisted hiring and promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's customers made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who traded it for the major carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin during the last few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the body that governs the parish and is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing his concern that the latter "pretends to pass on the costs" to the board, even if it had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors that he sent to the diocese.
Some people complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark Injures Boy While Fishing for Lobster in California
Police said a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy Saturday while fishing for locusts in California on the first day of the crustacean season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying out for help, at which point he swam with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just excitement for fishing a lobster, but that he soon realized he was screaming "I was locked!
I was trapped!”
His collarbone was shattered." Hammel said he noticed it when he got to the boy.
“I shout to everyone out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The first responder, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that they had spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but had determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper torso.
The officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to launch an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty corridors similar to those of the large warehouses full of specialist helpers.
As part of the UK’s substantial <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion immersion in the beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home products fall, the biggest runners with beauty products will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country, and then switch to others next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product offering to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those you can see in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are vegan-friendly, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions in two Sainsbury’s establishments; the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a shift that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive chairman of Sainsbury's, said the establishments will increasingly resemble shopping malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl, with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat points of sale in hundreds of stores, as it bought both chains two years ago.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmacy revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was said to be involved in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We are transforming the image of our beauty runners to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that you can turn to for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit all needs and the attractive and practical locations mean we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby retires from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones walked away "furious" after television host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11-million-pound deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for his Truly brand of homewear and accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones throwing sparks as he withdrew from his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant that she no longer had time to devote to both of them's homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and it was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, turned to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It was to be his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all the people involved in the project astonished.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that leaving the host of This Morning is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and textiles for the home, and that it could further delay its launch.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host on ITV’s I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we should not comment on his business affairs."
It’s a long conversation, and then we’ll get married.”
He joked with the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unlike a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said by putting his voice of "newspaper presenter."
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in June in Singapore, which Trump sees as a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three pesos after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at Saturday's UN General Assembly that the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Things with North Korea are going well," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages, and returning the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this amphitheater, we’d have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said.
Earthquake and tsunami devastate Indonesian island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not going to ask for international aid, so it is a challenge,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly endures, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not commonly found on other coasts.
Although a warning had been issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of cases, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's deteriorated infrastructure, and lavishing money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is plagued by a major lack of funds in the final straight to next year’s re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of living the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of clashes in the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1–0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot at the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced towards the upper left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga that jumped into the air and entered the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize ourselves, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I came up to Kante and gave him a touch without thinking too much and I just shot.”
Chelsea won 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning close to the mid-change and running into Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful in-depth pass driving Hazard into the area.
Hazard overtook the defense and ended up on the second stick scoring with a left-handed shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool face Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the national disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday that caused waves of up to 6 meters, Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered in rubble from the demolished buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police asked people in the area who had seen or heard something to take a step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan stated: 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make an appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera on the dashboard to contact us, as they might have key information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a neighbor in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was that morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are in the process of informing the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police have informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that they will not be able to enter again for a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There is a woman on the scene crying.
He said, “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 citing record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
Their banning would be poetic justice for their Taliban destruction of so many of England's religious and cultural objects carried out by their fanatical and puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "foolish" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell located outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider still worthy of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than he is now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also deserving of celebration and commemoration."
A pig kills a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and murdered a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, identified only by his last name, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a barnyard at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer is preparing to put the vaccines to pigs in a barn on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to another adjacent courtyard.
He said there was a big male in the barn with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he was killed.
“My cousin had bloodied and broken legs,” his cousin, nicknamed “Wu,” told the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence on stage.
It appears that Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although not very common, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans previously.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig huddled a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don't usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger.
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... they have no intention of doing harm.
You just have to give them the respect they need,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy, widespread rain to the southwestern U.S.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it flies over the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. ET Sunday morning, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was about 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward, which will penetrate the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the valley will create abundant and widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause precipitation to approach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form canyons that could become floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally cracked winds and dust.
The valley will bring locally heavy rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause minor debris flow and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall spreads to late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature fluctuations in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the U.S.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high odds of above-average temperatures for the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate testimonies of Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual schedule for a Friday breaking news story: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is one hundred percent certain that Kavanaugh was drunk and that he tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company counted the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To get an idea, it is an audience similar to a football final or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all channels with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had $3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC $2.89 million, and CNN $2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement indicating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being slapped by protesters as he tried to enter an elevator on his way to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stared down for several minutes while being reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said, "You have the power while there are a lot of helpless women."
Flake said his office made a statement Flake, before the elevator had closed, adding that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable networks broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination before the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated allegations against the nominee the following week, which urged a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside his on the front page of the paper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs from the other side was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect in LSU Player's Death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
According to the Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on a second-degree murder charge.
Officers broadcast the video of the confrontation between The Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the stage and claimed they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said they admitted to being the shooter who killed Wayde.
The defense said he was on bail of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death is a bullet wound to the head that hit the neck.
The department commended the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Unit, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, Southern University Police for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 winger was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average for last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "abatted" and "shocked" by Wayde's passing.
“That’s what worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano drops ash over Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several thunders and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clash between Catalan police and separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia’s secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists contained by riot police threw eggs and powder paint that created dark dust clouds on the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
Later that same day, there were also fights with the police, who used the batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Neither forget nor forgive" confronted unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people had to be taken care of for minor injuries received in the protest, according to local media.
Tensions continue in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum held by the Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although turnout was low and opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place equally but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence rally with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would achieve independence.
“We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying for joy when I was able to vote, but now we’re tired,” she said.
Despite obtaining a narrow, if decisive, victory in the regional elections last December, this year the pro-independence Catalan parties struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained awaiting trial for their participation in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for European Parliament election the following year.
"To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Car Strikes House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry house on several occasions.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Police Investigation Inspector Bob Blemmings declared the fence and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It is also possible that a beast was shot at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise to a level after the Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, from which they separate eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remain undefeated in the division for the sixth consecutive game; head coach Holt has not yet known the loss since replacing Kenny Miler in the past.
The Livingston misses opportunities in front of weakened visitors
Holt's team must have been ahead of schedule long before they scored, as with their control they caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but his crossfire did not cross the goal threshold; then Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a header from Craig Halkett from across the goal.
The host team settled for letting the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger the visitors in the standstill plays.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston made a serve in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces to fix Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession but faced an impenetrable defense that avoided a lot of work for goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop by Kelly.
Rangers keeper Allan McGregor stopped a shot from Scott Pittman with his feet, and Lithgow kicked the ball off another play on Livingston's still ball.
Many cross passes were issued in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one per hand and one for a Halkett entry to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent, and they continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His style of play and players have hardly changed since he returned to the top tier, but part of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has pushed the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, superbly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave neither Connor Goldson nor Joe Worrall any respite throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's orders, on this occasion they did not reach that level.
They failed the last pass. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. An entire call to the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the latest day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to settle relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters flocked to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflect the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when colliding with a car
A cyclist has died in a collision in which a car was engulfed in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed in a runaway hit on Childers Street just over a mile from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in the high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The riot began at Worcestershire's HMP Long Lartin around 9:30 a.m. (British daylight saving time) on Sunday and continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which eight inmates who are contained in a pavilion are involved.
Officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "Prison staff specially trained to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin has been deployed.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was learned that the director of the penitentiary had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officers had to go to jail to calm down a riot in which staff were assaulted with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought-affected places could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and that the last hour of Monday will come with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a post on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones had maintained the state of depression or tropical storm within a 320-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread within a 64-kilometre radius of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Weather Service forecast 50 to 10 l/m2 of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 in the Arizona Mogollón Bordo.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin could reach up to 25 or 50 litres, with isolated totals of 100 l/m2 being possible.
For those out of danger of flash flooding, the rain from Rosa could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain could be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second largest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heads north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is encountering cold water in the Pacific and thus losing strength.
For this reason it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
It could rain heavily in some areas of Mexico, posing a significant flood risk.
"Total rainfall is expected to be between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 250 l/m2 possible," reports weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then continue to climb through Arizona and enter southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. Southwest Desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains can cause sudden waterspouts and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Assassination
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 04:00 GMT.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to somerset police, three 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old boys were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the cell phone of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the pettiness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial on his accusation.
The president said Saturday that that day "Americans" witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with a record of uncontaminated public service,” he said, addressing West Virginia’s crowd of fans.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
“It’s five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t do it, but I do,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates.”
Trump has argued that the Democrats’ mission is “to oppose and obstruct.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, an assistant Republican Party official told CNN.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami kills hundreds and numbers continue to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people had died, many of them swept away by giant waves that broke through the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters smashed the luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were killed," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it swept away cars, logs, homes, it swept away everything it found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traversed the high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many destroyed shops and buildings, twisted and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Appraisal and Application (BPPT) has stated that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, settled at the end of a long narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "heavy" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the casualties and damage could be greater along the north coast of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were "totally paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming frantically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people who were on the street.
In a matter of minutes the water crashes into the edge carrying buildings and cars forward.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that caused communications to be cut across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated are still in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has been reopened but only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's awful.
Along the way the World Vision staff got to the town of Palu, where employees shelter in canvas shelters raised in the backyard of their office, they watched scenes of utter devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's awful.
Even as the groups began the unpleasant task of launching disaster assistance, some complained that they were preventing foreign aid workers with great knowledge and experience from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the place of the calamity is declared a national catastrophic zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open up to international aid, but that time has not yet come.”
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of the missing clung to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that lightens the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was taken out of a sink.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional charge,” he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours following the news of the downing of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, only one gray mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he added.
They stole $26,750 while charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
In the press release, investigative officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cashier at the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money from him that he had to deliver.
According to the memo, witnesses saw several suspects left the stage, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about their identities, contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Being formerly known as Kanye West."
For some time now, West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said that same year as he spoke about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
I went from Kanye, which means the one, to Ye alone, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is another of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also managed to put on and off the script and use capital letters.
Obama vows not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians again as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students approaches.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he "would not use the military again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drags boys into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in A.I.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, a former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be the number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubting the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat American Othello's highest-scoring player and later became an executive at Microsoft Research of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government scholarships, Lee says.
“China is not leading academic leaders, it is leading companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired college geniuses to work in AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think they should offer residency cards to doctors in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not recorded movement for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece and block applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim to its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents allege that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot of the referendum was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for gaining admission to entities such as the EU or NATO from Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would abide by the result of the vote and that they would make it definitive.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of the parliament.
The state election commission stated that at 1 p.m. no irregularities had been recorded.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, our seat is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko deposited their vote for the Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country that would pave the way for its accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up for those who had boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our heads held high and not through the service door," Kavadarkov added.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said a positive outcome would be the "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the required.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May of last year.
See: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses the entire defense of Brighton and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling accounted for Brighton's 2-0 defence of Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the 65th minute goal.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenses before heading to the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He got rid of a defender before overtaking several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touchdown in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who struck Brighton guard Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems at the foot," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We’re going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were fortunate that he scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Celtics the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball at the depth of Brighton's pitch on that play.
He sent a beautiful hollow pass on the right side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several taps before driving Sterling to the opposing post.
The Celtics threw the ball into the goal before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to give the Rockies a party
With the Nationals out of the knockout match, there was not much reason to force another title.
But an ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still knockout implications for the Rockies, who bring a game of advantage to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League's West Division.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but continue to try to close their first division title.
“Although we didn’t play anything, we can at least play the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing probably at the highest level I’ve played this year.
“Why don’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the starter on Sunday, but it appears they are inclined to have Scherzer throw in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom his 34th start would be, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely release Sunday on his usual day off.
Washington's right is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the outcome in the midterm elections.
We did everything we did in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a big, big thing... I don’t compete, but I really do and that’s why I’m going everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what’s going on now.
And they are determined to regain power using any means necessary, wickedness, and pettiness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to pass over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control and we’re never going to give it to them.”
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and obstruct.”
“And they’ve seen that in the past four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, cocky, disgusting and liars.”
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, which received strong public outcry.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm..hey, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open.
They are not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, the truth is that I wasn’t too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she faced anti-Semitism decisively.
In my case, the no-confidence motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, incidentally issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for Friday’s Nottingham East Labour meeting indicated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, the Friday night committee meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "kinder and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten, if ever begun.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and it is judged whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues with whom he believed he shared a similar political vision began to expect me to portray and take positions with which I would never agree, both on matters of national security and the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly, and it really doesn’t matter a little bit what I say, there’s a tremendous uproar and social media attacks censoring center politics, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how insult levels have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every “untrustworthy” move or every change in the selection rules, the game becomes narrower in scope.
Over the past few years I have received many tips urging me to keep my head down, unless I’m so outspoken and then “everything would go well for me.”
I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago while still in school, driven by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had literally dropped my classroom, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and government minister.
I’ve never done anything wrong, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused with my political views and in which I do not agree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted Friday’s motion, all I would say is that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and utilities, I don’t understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat or political expediency will dissuade me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayr takes the lead
It is possible that the last two attempts altered the final result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this pleasant game of the Tenent's Premier League.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten.
Ultimately it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risk, that led the team to victory. And coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“So far we have been put to the test in our game and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "You have to admit that Ayr took advantage of the opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot got a wrong pitch.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of the day, he turned a solo shot, leaving the score 17-5 in Ayr's favor at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a prolonged stop due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher and, from the restart, Ayr advanced further through a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with a Bruce Colvine rehearsal that was not consumed, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for scoring Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored a rehearsal from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the pitch in the area from David Armstrong and sent it to third liner Gregor Henry to get the fifth home team rehearsal.
The protagonist of Still Game begins a new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears poised to enter the restaurant industry after being named director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the definitive, and it appears that Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a source at the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant business".
‘The Sea is Ours’: Inner Bolivia Expects Court to Road to Pacific
The sailors guarded a naval headquarters covered with aircraft in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are drowned with the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Perhaps those hopes are at their peak in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision of the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the IGC ruling on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate Bolivia’s concession of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday’s sentence.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia the reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the IJC sentence comes just six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", says Chilean expert in international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have been delayed.
“The issue of access to the sea has been blocked for a long time by the current Bolivian administration,” says Zárate.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill that remained in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually swift decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have “a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile”, and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit”.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using this theme for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong, has declared that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if it cannot rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a utopia" that continued U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War will double down on the North.
In Washington, they are reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump are looking forward to a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or cover yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the catwalk a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that stunned the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers brought their most amazing creations to the runway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide flap mimicking feathers that flooded the models' heads.
Among other large accessories were jeweled watermelons, a magician's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations looked like a complete dive gear, with the glasses and tube, and others a melted ice cone.
If you’re a big fan of fashion, you’re in luck.
Fashion connoisseurs predicted that giant hats could reach the stores.
The disproportionate hats come just after the “Bomb,” the straw hat with a 60-centimeter flap that carries everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that is behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought out another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag of straw almost as big as the model dressed in a swimsuit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the spring summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope the big hats and beach bags will hit stores next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level for pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a bespoke curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it comes to his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest pass rates in private schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who studied foreign languages scored excellently.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained honorary tuition in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are being given the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in private school programs of all kinds.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Training Commission in 2014 found that a lack of language skills accounts for 17% of the reasons why employers have a hard time filling vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will place a bilingual person directly at the top of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
This is why it is so important to invest in a language for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those in developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the language of instruction differs by school.
Some schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what the interests of your children are, private schools always have several languages to choose from and teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and staff with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
We cannot deny that right now, in a global business environment, languages are still vitally important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's head coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready,” he said.
Trump's Elections Arrive in Virginia on YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump’s five planned rallies next week, including stops in neighboring cities such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote paused for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, given that Republicans risk losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally following live on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week’s trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and holds the Senate confirmation vote for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November election with new momentum.
Therefore, these five rallies that Trump will hold next week are aimed at “dynamizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is as important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible ahead of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
This evening’s rally, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters of “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get Pittsburgh media coverage,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
“It’s not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come and support him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday's individual matches
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pulse swing pendulum is a totally invented sporting concept but in which athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I guess we took that as a bit of momentum,” Spieth said as he departed at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a little bit of wind in their favor and a lot to cheer for, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each has three points out of four.
Spieth has proved lethal from tee to green and is preaching by example.
Those guttural screams became stronger as his round progressed, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
On getting the putt that made them win the 15th game, he yelled similarly, the kind of scream he says he believes the American team isn't out yet.
“You just have to concentrate and worry about your game,” Spieth said.
It’s the only thing left for these players.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four out of four and can’t be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That route, and the way their energy seems to flow into and from the crowd, confirms them as the rivals to beat on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to get a win when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first run ended up with the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close by the interactions between couples, the tips given, the ones not and the way you can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and they have a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has the stamina to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods struggling to climb four points to the scoreboard at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, seeking to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but failed to cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they matched up to defeat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without penalty or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning fourballs, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning a loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2&1 win over Spaniard John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in Ryder Cup history when a team went up four points in the singles, although as the current holder of the trophy, Furyk's team only needs to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister on Saturday informed the United Nations that continued sanctions have increased its distrust of the United States and that the country would not surrender its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important steps to show its goodwill” last year, including stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test fields and committing to nuclear weapons and technology proliferation.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the US," he added.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first.”
As Ri resumed well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean peninsula while Trump ensured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted easing harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its coercive goal, and even opposes 'declaring the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other side of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after “evil president” Trump called Kim “a rocket man on a suicide mission.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in taking action for disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said Wednesday that there was no deadline for that, and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three or five months.”
China and Russia are discussing whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: “Compliance with the Security Council’s sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying he had made progress, just hours after North Korea denounced him for making "mafia claims."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took “corresponding measures.”
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was requesting were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of the male culture of studying all night long stimulated by caffeine.
One academic found that students at the world’s number one university often lack the basics about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you only telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basics about how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," Czeisler added.
The pride culture of staying up all night, he says, still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the growing pressure for students to fall asleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough sleep and good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, she points out. Even avoiding getting fat, since lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which makes you constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to request all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to go to bed, as well as to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team intended to record their first home win since the 4–1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team led Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager, which left his team eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a Rangers lineup with little inspiration never gave the feeling that he was going to draw.
While the Rangers descended to sixth place, Livingston rose to third place and is only behind Hibernian by one goal.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to have treated for a head injury after the alleged launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes from the team that ravaged Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same Livingston 11 who scored a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way their organized ensemble has stifled their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-half short pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed this great opportunity.
A potent free kick from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defenseman, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him in the second stick.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Undoubtedly, Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have to have struck a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only fired two shots at the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox guard Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pitched the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick Menga for a single shot.
Gerrard acted at halftime by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left-hander made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty by entangling with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and Counted... was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A mainstay of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earbuds, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Say, sure it's bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Defective Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Defective Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer and re-inject it
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer called HER2, and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "boosts the growth of various cancers", including those of the breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to address cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump speech while wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat following his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
The result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was slapped in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s a racist?’
If I had been concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault lawsuits.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded West's critical footage to social media.
It’s unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They came with me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They intimidated me!
And then they said I was going to die,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm doing?" He said, "I'm going to wear my superman cap, because it means you can't tell me what to do."
“Test with love.”
His comments stirred up stirrings in the audience at least twice and the SNL cast members seemed to be embarrassed, he told Variety magazine, with the following testimony that one person who was there gave to the publication: "The whole studio was left in absolute silence."
West had been nominated as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed with a performance of the song I love it, dressed like a Perrier water bottle.
West got the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FACEING THE MAFIA"
However, a talk show host, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "being who he is and that's completely wonderful".
“However, I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
It's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the latest music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted manslaughter at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor’s Office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his swordsmanship role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on screen translate into it looking like young people often have to be tough to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels “quite strong” to tackle the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. Where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity thanks to its highly masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it’s really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that "enough of horses and battlefields".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so in a way it provided me with my future family and my life from here on out,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, the health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to practically zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they claim that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from Republican senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the statements were being made by websites and "ultra-right" commentators.
"Lies, lies and more infamous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, the seat of the United States government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters department and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for the leakage of this information.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement prompted online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial was made with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“He has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they didn’t do, you shouldn’t get angry.
It should not be challenging.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to oust Waters in the midterm election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“Very strong if it were true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his department alerted "the law enforcement agencies and appropriate authorities to these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure we find the culprits as well as that they are held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team.”
Johnny English Strikes Again: The Powerless Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the Johnny English action comedy parody franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire about how obviously stupid we are become the nation’s new export opportunity?
Either way, Johnny English's incompetent, rubber-faced, lollipop-eyed character has renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comedic creation designed for non-English-speaking film territories.
Naturally, it is the silly secret agent who, despite his whimsical pretensions of flattering glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed a single note on the theme of Fire Carts at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television commercials, in which he sowed chaos in his wake.
There are a couple of good moments in Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor pitches make a brief bang against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy leaps to the fore, but it gives the impression that humor has little force and is oddly superfluous, especially when such "serious" films as 007 and Mission: Impossible already use comedy compellingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was aimed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s extravagant misadventures are not as ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson’s silent-film jokes in playing the character of Bean.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker infiltrates Britain’s top-secret web spy network and reveals the identities of all the British agents in the area, much to the distress of the agent on duty, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the culmination of a pompous and conflicting prime minister, who already suffers a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can not do much with the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since all active spies have been committed, she will need to get someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives unofficial classes on how to become an undercover agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the academy of spies to a rock school.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former and suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit lost.
So the Batman and Robin of His Majesty's Secret Service mistakes return to action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous falcatruadas: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; they create a riot that puts them illegally aboard the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the interior of the house of Volta.
Obviously, all the arrests come from that last sequence, but how kind and scandalous it is, it seems taken from a children's television show.
The result is fairly regular.
And, as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make Britons work four days a week, but pay for five.
Allegedly, the party wants employers to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "adjust" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four-day shifts a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to balancing the pro-worker economy as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At present, however, the Labour Party does not support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week does not fit into the party's policy and is not being considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply the possibility that the current shareholders of the water companies will not recover all their investment, since a Labour government could make "deductions" because of the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to hand over 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, who pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed by at least a week the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question is whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support for him.
On Sunday, in an interview broadcast, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I would go to the hearing. I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusation came out and asked him if he had done so.
It was firm, determined, resounding.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be immovable.
“My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened; but I know this: Brett has categorically denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive line-up of performing stars and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the attending public had to complete a number of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen 12 years after achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism,” people who think it makes a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its followers, driving a set of different goals.
These actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.2 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK society of investors and executors that has pledged to “help children develop to their full potential”, with a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as with the great anti-apartheid and civil rights movements that preceded us, we will achieve it, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to carry out a “blockade” to hinder Russia’s energy exports, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior announced
“In case it is necessary,” Washington can resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, said U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s engagement in Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
They have the means and the means to deal with it.
“The United States has the capacity, together with the navy, to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to market,” he said.
Zinke thus addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, bearing in mind that, in practice, it is the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to harness and replace fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “only one tactic” with an oil-dependent economy.
The statements were made while the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin Moscow’s “captive.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was established to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. stance garnered reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry-leading organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her candidacy for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her candidacy for president after the midterm election.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” she said.
“After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticisms of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented in a tweet “of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote.”
However, in a poll published on Thursday, it was shown that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator would not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk's Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent voted in favour of the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what’s happening again, I can see reflected in other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans "return different, hardened, wondering if there is any respect for what fellow militia and airmen, as well as other members of the army, have offered the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a lawsuit in connection with a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court-friendly report in Washington to support a policy-defying asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit of Sessions of Grace v. which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
Detained in Texas.
Lawyers in the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers for the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with criminal and domestic violence-related organizations.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be adjudicated according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle,” the court’s report said.
Prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy of refusing immigrant entry hurts the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they “provide labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and the violence of criminal organizations.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as casualties double in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
“The circumstances are very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby in the evacuation center of the demolished town of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in town.
“I heard my wife call for help and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or her family.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Abuse with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper proclaiming the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 U.S. Congressional elections, a fact China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials coined in Reuters as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to post commercial advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war witnessing the levelling of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the US, China’s countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to harm exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an opinion piece written by Branstad and published in Sunday's edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China "is intensifying this harassment campaign by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press."
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America’s cherished tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in the newspaper stand at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissenting voices and no real reflection is seen of the disparate views that the Chinese may have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He also claims that "one of the most important newspapers in China declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm which newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh's Disaster Makes Women's Republican Vote Lost Just Days Ahead of Midterm Elections
Although many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite varying allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a backlash, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans positioned themselves to move forward with the vote.
“These things can’t be undone,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, said in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last hour for an FBI investigation is enough to calm the moods of angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, opponents of the "November is Coming!" flu demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate, while the Republicans, under the control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The Democrats' motivation and enthusiasm will surpass any expectation," neutral political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site.
“It’s already high.
But it’s going to be even more so, especially among the undecided female voters in the suburbs or those between the ages of 18 and 29, who even though they don’t like the President, don’t usually go to the polls.”
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested it was possible to suffer a backlash if the Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
“This has become a disaster for the Republican Party,” former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote or whether or not Kavanaugh will sit on the bench. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that aids the election of Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing the testimony of Ford or that of Kavanaugh, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony entirely or probably, compared to 35% who support Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30% who think the same of Ford.
Following the pressure exerted by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her drunk when she was 17.
Instead, Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her the genitals at a college party while she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
“We have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or POD.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this store of personal data unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company describes this as “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s vision, according to its chairman John Bruce, is for the company to provide appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-owned security company, some contracted developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models overnight.
“We don’t need your permission.”
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann, cleric awarded the Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on 29 September 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were tasked with discovering a memorial in his honor at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather’s feat that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the yoke of intense machine gun fire".
Later he rushed to reach the line of fire and, with "great courage", steered the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and downed three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something he could never live with, but a lesson yet".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which headed the Imperial Brentwood youth band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of this genuine hero is demonstrated by the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts off MMA fans at the best of times
Imagine that you take all night awake to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when the best part comes something prevents you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 fights, six of which were major, and was being broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to meet, viewers in the UK were puzzled when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many hours awake waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a very tasteless joke".
“State regulations rule that that content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and that’s why it had to be switched to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will take UK viewers into account in future programming.
“I think we can fix it when we think about repetition,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. there, we can’t fix it until Sunday, which is already Monday for them.
But we are working to find a solution.
When the change occurred I began to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical error.
No, it was a government issue.
I promise it won’t happen again.
We will limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give our fans the most, but we passed and
We have a lot of anger.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, claims that he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims he did not realize that not everyone was like him until he arrived at high school.
Invited to the first broadcast of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he started talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this show, is on sick leave.
As a guest on the first show led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked boys and girls".
“To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what has driven me and given me the strength to succeed.”
I wanted to prove that I was “someone” so that people wouldn’t be disappointed to discover their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was quite a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20-year gap between them was never a problem.
“When you live so long in such a short time” (she was only 14 years old when she first participated in an Olympics and her father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone your age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth caused Daley to completely change her perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But now I know there are things much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley’s father didn’t accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son for were tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him I wouldn’t be here to occupy that front row,” Daley shared.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that very moment, at the moment of his death, that I realized that he wasn’t really invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
The choice of the song Proud by Heather Small is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on the tip.

A low-form Mickelson finished on the Ryder Cup bench this Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to improve his technique so that it does not become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed on the bench by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and could not participate in Saturday's fourball or foursomes.
Instead of being the center of action, as so many other times for America, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his moves.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of his career, at 48 years old he does not fit into the tight Le Golf National course, where the tall grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And as if that wasn’t enough, Mickelson faced in Sunday’s ninth game the precise Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points short at the start of the 12 individual games, start off on a good footing, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted her husband, though he couldn't say much more.
“He understood perfectly the role I was playing today, slapped me on the shoulder, slapped me in the arm and told me that tomorrow I would be ready,” Furyk said.
“He had complete confidence in himself.
He has a prominent spot in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think I’d play two games.
I thought I’d play more, but in the end that’s how things are and that’s how we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangibles to the team.
“He’s a funny, sarcastic person, with wit and he likes to mess with people, he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he said.
"I like to see how well the younger players have had it with him this week.
He’s a lot more than a good player.”
Europe’s captain, Thomas Bjorn, fears the loss of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage on the last Ryder Cup singles day can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Dane debuted in 1997 in a game at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the finish line with a minimal advantage winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You still think we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by little," reflects Bjorn, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for it all.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I’m focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted with the performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we'll meet the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner next to you when things are going well, but when you face things individually, then test your ability as a golfer to the fullest.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he too must make the best of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than his teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those last day spins, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but ending up losing after the European miracle at Medinah."
"I remember every damn word," he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players for the final day.
“We have 12 important games, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there’s a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We prepared our line-up with this in mind and put the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
“I decided on this order because I think it covers all the way,” Bjorn explained about his selection for the singles.
Germany's new warship postponed once more
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it will not arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and increasing cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ships, as well as with concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy younger frigates for up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit rightly points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and which will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the motives behind this return, but the German media spoke of "crucial defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half the personnel needed on the former Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total price of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it already reaches the astonishing amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the younger frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making waters.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships fit to deploy.
The officer claims that this problem is increasing, as the old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research being carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is making.
A habitat map will then be developed to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation advisor at NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating grasslands and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the past century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do traps with glue for flies, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks from domestic cats.
Bats are not blind,
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who periodically conduct surveys, inspections of children and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization even has Scotland's only and first bat reserve at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, manager of Estate, states that this is the ideal territory for them.
“In Threave we have a large area for bats,” he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we don’t yet know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the properties, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest could kill up to 400 females and young, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, or disturb them, as well as destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There is still a lot to learn about bats, and in the case of many of the species, we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo dismisses rape lawsuits and his lawyers prepare to sue the German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the rape allegations against him false, claiming that the only thing people want is to make themselves known using his name.
His lawyers will sue German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker has been accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375,000 to not say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel published on Friday.
Hours after its publication, Ronaldo, 33, called this news fake in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
“No, not a thousand times.
What was said today is false," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“People want to get to know each other by my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
I’m a happy and respectable man,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they describe as "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt down saying that he was 99% a knight, but that that 1% had betrayed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual intercourse consented to by both parties.
Mayorga also contends that she went to the police and that she had photographs of the injuries, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt terrified by the reprisals and was concerned about the public derision.
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to revoke the agreement while remaining traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers will leave the UK
The UK would forever regret the loss of its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had stated on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need to come to an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that in the event that Brexit did not come to an agreement, the impact of delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, we will be witnessing how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have also expressed fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW has confirmed that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car makers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very tight, every 37 minutes arrive parts from suppliers from the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and shortages of parts could result.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark states that Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls.”
"It is essential to have a deal. And we want it to be the best deal, so that we can enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year employee at Burnaston and union coordinator at Unite, said its members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they had presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House said the high-risk meeting of Donald Trump and Undersecretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed by a week because of the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Russia’s aides and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the President through the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accuse him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is still no fixed date, it could be this week or be a week late, given all that is happening in the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press to be informed.”
Some journalists have questioned that claim, as Sanders has not held a press conference since September 10.
When Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said the lack of news briefings was not due to an aversion to the grandiloquence of reporters, although she added that she will not be the one to deny that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, without citing any source to back up the data.
Sanders said: "If the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, that's much better than directing the questions to her.
You are witnesses to how we have been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can speak directly with the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, press conferences alone are scarce.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free and on rare occasions before the assembled journalists.
A letter from the health secretary to calm the moods in the face of Brexit
The Health Secretariat has sent a letter to EU workers in Scotland’s NHS expressing the country’s gratitude and expressing its wish that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal situation.
I know this is a time of trouble for all of us.
I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Partners in the European Union and beyond bring indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he fainted upon reaching the band line.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a stretcher for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He added that there are no details yet on the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year red-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five innings in total on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who purchase a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher bell tax when they buy a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The tax increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury hopes to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher bell tax when they buy a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on high-income people.
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will be used to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rental purchases, may be up to 3%.
The company expects the change to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which is driving up prices and making it harder for people who want to buy a home for the first time to gain access to the real estate market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the property transmission tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping house prices high by buying and not using land, and urged Mrs May to eliminate tax revenue percentages on moderately priced homes to fix Britain’s “housing shame.”
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of housing-related reform proposals, including rent control and a ban on deforestations where the tenant is not to blame.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it is necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as easy for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing as it is for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross stated that his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club from the northwest, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B team, and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my dad when I was a kid, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club.”
Ross's predecessors to Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic states that he felt no concern at all about the success of such established figures in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Will the success for me at this time depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly typical of a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task to get there, but I will probably only consider that I have succeeded here if I can return the club to the Premier League."
Ross has only spent three years as a coach after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months on the technical staff at Hearts.
In that period, he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and got St Mirren to move from being on the verge of relegation to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than he has ever been during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was probably at a real crossroads,” he recalled, about taking over the Alloa.
"I really thought that training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because it didn’t hurt me, I earned reasonably good life and enjoyed some successes.
Playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I continue to suffer from them in terms of stress and pressure at work, but I like training.
I’ve always enjoyed training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heatwave increased consumption in more difficult British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent growth during July, but restaurant consumption fell 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, member of the CGA commercial advisory, who compiled the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's longer-than-expected stay at the World Cup caused a similar pattern to June in July, in which pubs enjoyed a 2.8 percent increase in consumption, although restaurants suffered an even greater punishment.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant turnover during June worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specializing in beverages were the ones that had the best results with increases in consumption exceeding the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Meal-specialist pubs have also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It’s like people just want to go out and drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, consumption of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and consumption of meals decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, an employee at RSM’s leisure and hospitality analytics company, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a drop of 4.8 per cent annually will be especially painful if this is added to the continued increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering business and the weather will be in charge of saying whether the moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide much-needed respite for the sector.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined profits of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is considered the benchmark of the sector.

A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "Fake Insta" pages
This has led to an increase in fears of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "Fake Insta" accounts (referring to the social photo-sharing network Instagram).
This news has led to a growing fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a softened "main" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found a teenager asking for her to be “raped.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is alarming that there are so many teenagers tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the council of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from his membership," Beattie said in a statement.
Doyle said: "I am very eager to be a spokesperson for the athletes and I look forward to being able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics among a total of four Olympic golds and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from being able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered an apoplexy.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I currently do agility exercises.
“Thank you for the encouragement.”
An ad for a breast pump comparing women to cows divides public opinion in the networks
A breastfeeding company has divided public opinion on the web with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To announce the launch of the world’s first silent portable breast milk extractor, Elvie has released an ironic music video-style announcement to demonstrate the freedom that the new breast milk extractor offers mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of ugly cows to the rhythm of a song with lyrics like: "Yes, I move myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't realize, they're not udders, they're my breasts".
The chorus continues: “Muxe, muxe, I’m feeding the babies, muxe, muxe, I’m milking my friends.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that it highlighted the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we robbed their children days after giving birth.”
The Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly inside a maternal bra (Elvie/mother)
Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and baby.
But yes, why aren’t they used to advertise a breast pump for mothers who stay with their babies?”
Another viewer added the following: "What an announcement with so little tact".
Other viewers defended the ad, including a woman who said the song seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
The milk made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is a bit silly, but I interpreted it as a joke.
It’s a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump their milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their fasteners.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who pump their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be discreetly fitted into a maternal bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are pumping their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother commented: “The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative release.
In describing the parallelism between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of milk and all the challenges it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This isn’t the first time Elvis has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to assign godparents to the children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their households would have to send their fingerprints and that those data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who are godparents or who are part of their household are in the country illegally, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we will continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In order to prosecute the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require any of them to appear in court within a month of their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear by videoconference rather than in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be expelled.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escapes, according to shelter workers and system reports released over the past few months.
Lawyers said those fears increased in larger centers such as Tornillo, where there is a greater chance that symptoms of a child having a hard time will go unnoticed due to their size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were found on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “of any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem declared that the right conditions were in place for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "spreading of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
“We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian affair.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the three-million-person province.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions would target the jihadists, including the soldiers of the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem set out the conditions to guarantee the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the body's work should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
It would be “the most dramatic end of a presidency.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to reach 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to reach 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million from four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable channel's ratings with 3.5 million viewers during the major news nights.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama for ABC’s Designated Survivor, about a ministerial cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election?
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell said to me.
There is entertainment within chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the plots that emerge from Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether migrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Even so, it supposes something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours watching an expert panel debate Bob Woodward’s use of “anonymous” sources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin bomber jacket (“a garment full of arrogance,” Mr. Washington Pos stated) and the implications of the scabrition of the Scabritor.
I will never see Super Mario again.
“Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it’s giving you something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, a senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” a space that deals with the changes in characters and the daily plot twists of the Trump show (the conflict with the NFL, praise for Kim Jong-un...).

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and a temperature of 26 degrees outside my home on the north coast of Kauai, but I was locked in the house watching MSNBC while I was shooting CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back then and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Foreign money goes to hell to fund the candidacies for the House for the elections of half the legislature
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two acting representatives in the race to occupy the same post.
This newly reorganized district on the outskirts of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who secured his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb stands against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping over the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans had manipulated the constituency of the old districts in their favor.
The election race in the new 17th congressional district unleashed a campaign-funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieving a narrow victory in the March special elections for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, which enjoyed wide following.
That position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support for China and then backed down
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a pleasant meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to order the return of the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama “for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman for the country, in a statement released earlier this month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million of US aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, has been discussed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent people from emigrating to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions being applied to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance the administration attaches to it, the diplomats said.
The three American envoys returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal deliberations as long as participants remained anonymous.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was maintained.
Studying History
The next negative case could be special adviser Robert Mueller’s report on the case of possible obstruction of justice for Mr. Trump, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public archives.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are many unknowns and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, as is that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to carry out a coup against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy is either accelerated or reversed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points at this time.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying the water to his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that he was incapacitated for office.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that the Times information is not true.
“How are we going to respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unbiased or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that demands accountability from Mr. Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which was the headquarters of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Shabbat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain this month, would put them in a very favorable position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for more important things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal are a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something positive and we achieved a point.
We had a chance to win at the end, but overall, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were better.
Thursday is going to be another big night.
We hope to achieve all three points, but it will be difficult, because they got a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we can fight to get a positive result.
“Last year was tough between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the team, but there is an excellent atmosphere at the moment.
The team is good, the guys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the past season and succeed.”
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants were clear about how they wanted to be taken care of, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this Nationwide study said they talked to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about the issue.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes to them well in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to agree where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor will also be able to help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to designate a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure the professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider signing a power of attorney to manage your finances.
You will need to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down that information in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who treat it?” asked Martin.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Set up a plan.”
A man is shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked back home after leaving at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 British Summer Time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not serious and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Due to communications cuts, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that lies along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regency, an administrative region lower than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Belt of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, on December 26, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the regency of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily taken out.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence for preventing a complaint of domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, they took away her phone.
Palin remains in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, in which he pleaded "not guilty, of course" when asked, the jail reported.
Palin faces three Type A misdemeanor offences, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Type B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of drunken weapons in connection with the incident.
His wife accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to the PTSD syndrome she suffers after serving with the military in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are unavailable, and the death toll is expected to increase over the course of days.
The quake occurred just off Central Celebes, in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a rare death penalty to the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
New York state prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway, killing pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and that he caused them serious injuries "intentionally", according to the notification of intent to request the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "remarkable planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York has not prosecuted a death penalty case for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal New York case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, demonstrated lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos he viewed on his phone according to the indictment.
He also requested to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys ex officio charged with representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life imprisonment with no possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize a "people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party claimed that politicians had to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that she should handle negotiations with the EU.
Ordinary MEP Peter Bone told the Birmingham rally that the UK “would have already left” the EU if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by Ms May to reconcile the divided ranks of her party has become evident as the pro-EU Tories join an independent anti-Brexit protest held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the compromises of her Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated at the rally of Solihull's Leave Means Leave movement that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been relied on to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If I had given him the job, we would be out of the EU by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough Member of Parliament added the following: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan.”
He said: “We do not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false.”
Tories member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march, from which she told reporters: “All I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is not popular among the public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular among our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the rally that it is necessary to make politicians “uncomfortable” if they intend to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we are meeting today to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU held a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners with the message Tories Against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security concerns they suffered in a party application at the start of the conference.
“This is the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless border, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is an absolute farce.
The concept of good Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider her candidacy for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focus of speculation that she will be Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the council format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that it takes a woman in the post of president.”
An arrest has been made related to the deadly shooting of Sims, the LSU player
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference held at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man who was appearing in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
“Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of it,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2-meter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton reaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, starting from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel pitted first and let Hamilton run with traffic in the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
The Mercedes pitted one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after several wheel-to-wheel maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly release the interior at the risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver in turn three.
Max Verstappen set off from the last row of the starting grid and climbed back to seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to keeping his tyres to get to go faster in the final part and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually pitted on lap 44 but failed to advance any positions in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
Inadequate body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an event on Saturday for her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an event in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that people were "miserable, disgusting and liars".
“The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see that people are angry and that they are miserable, disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you see these posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't go."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make any leaks?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document?: "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't.
Wait a moment.
“No,” he said, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“I asked you to keep me confidential and you did what you asked me to do.”
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who remarked during Saturday night’s act: “I tell you that body language was not appropriate.
He may not have leaked it, but he used the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars remarked on Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5–3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored an early advantage with two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home side before Dwyer re-established the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard drew for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to rebound to beat Dundee 2–1 at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, with a balance of three wins before the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the 3:35 minute with an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later from Beauvillier following an assist from David Rutherford.
In a turbulent start period, Sullivan put the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to score the draw goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants overtook the score before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard tied the game again with a power play goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen overtake Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured victory by his team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of plane passengers can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller considered a hero after his death to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
The death toll is 800 and there are many missing after a major earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area and there are many people who are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his post at the control tower of Palu's violently swinging Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained at his post to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the departure runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said it was possible that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take you to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It breaks our hearts to find out,” he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands and the country’s disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The toll of victims is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the rubble and many of them could not be reached,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman, said in a statement.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing in bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
“People are looting the mini-markets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini claims there is one missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one missing after it previously claimed that the 47 passengers and crew had left the sinking plane without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were not able to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working together with authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Witnesses say the plane skipped the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, commented that he entered with very little height.
"That's an extremely positive thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers were able to advance between the water reaching their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working near the site on wharf improvement tasks also assisted in the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst Composes Chronology of the Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
The prosecution referred to the evidence on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that she received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis met Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his earlier claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When this data showed that his mobile phone was meeting Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the stand on Saturday and testified that that day was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records showed they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
“She was erased from her life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing remarks on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be settled by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is Hip Hop Consciousness?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and struggle against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get combative hip hop back to popularity.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York child caregiver sues couple after 'racist' message
A New York child caregiver is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from her mother complaining that she was "another black woman."
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, showed her anguish when she discovered that child caregiver Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER BLACK," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that the caregiver who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she expected a Filipina according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for the day’s work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice will sue the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for which she was initially hired even though there was no contract.
“Look, I want to show you that these things are not done,” he told the Post on Friday, adding later, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism by stating that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after offending her.
"My wife had sent him a message that I had no intention of sending him.
It's not racist.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it was due to a mistake?
Is your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the lawsuit to "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going for someone like that?”
That’s not very ethical,” the investment banker added.
While the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers had not identified themselves with a talking bear as can be concluded in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented about the letter: "It's hard to get in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s a lot of fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
After stating that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agrid" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom he describes as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
“He was a quiet man and not presumptuous,” he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you’re proud even if you didn’t really do it yourself.
I think I felt Paddington’s success a little bit that way.
Although it was a creation of his own and a product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors had given him to keep his heart beating were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
He had died a while before, and now he was dying.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to put up with it.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at that moment of mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
“Nobody noticed it,” he said.
I had my head down and tears were falling all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Postcards of afflicted women to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been placing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that can be called for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any room.”
However, he quit his job before dying and was "in a very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented, "I have continued concern that a side effect will occur."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day touched bottom (when the kids opened their presents, they didn’t make eye contact with them or anything).”
He claimed that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: "It tore the family apart.
We've been dismantled.
We have to move on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), it's possible that we could get a little unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "cracking out" due to supporters' paralysis.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Their reluctance is due to a question of deadlines.
If, as expected, the Republicans get poor results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they wish to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, putting pressure on them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently occupies 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea falls under Kim’s mandate
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections over the past year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people carrying people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the largest stretch of border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South (which technically continue to be at war) have improved remarkably over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work roughly to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security and, under those circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's inadequate for Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and assured that he was not suited by his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview conducted Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman ever behaved that way, they would call her hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost yelling and talking while describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputational killing" by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because it showed that he had prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he is confirmed in office and if Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“What I have to say is this: If you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then you’re not fit to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court you’re currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions Kavanaugh could make against the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and still expect us to say, ‘Look how good!’”
Women need to exercise.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and he cannot expel it without crying.
“We cried when we got angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that weird, right?”
She went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she also cried when she got angry, but who developed a technique that was that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then, it continued.
It seemed brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest recollections in one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I began to cry with an indescribable rage, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a distant superior who had always caused me a slight fear, and led me down the stairwell.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think that you are sad and that they will comfort you if they come to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an out-of-marriage adventure on a ship named Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he laughed 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Some call it "The White Sox and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was advancing, he was delayed in raising funds, so he swore that he would not run for the presidency unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to the male candidates would only give her $250.
"What do you think, I have a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not present a formal campaign, she was overcome by the emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported her, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates, and of anger over existing sexism) that left her speechless.
“You’d think she’d had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
“You’d think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"Did you cry?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and although the war is far from over, a distancing between countries could prove beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs affecting the equivalent of 200 billion dollars, recording half of the items that come to the United States from China.
Beijing counter-attacked each time in the same way, the most recent raising tariffs from five to ten percent on $60 billion in American products.
China has vowed to emulate U.S. measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will be immutable in the short term.
To get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to give in to its demands, but to bow publicly to the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually far more dangerous than previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centered researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the country's conditions are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it could receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he said he would not accept conditional aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located on the outskirts of Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. loss on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle offered during the tournament, sent the ball into the water in the 16th hole of par 3, losing his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all of his series, becoming one of only four players to score a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the European team's worst-ranked player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's first-place finisher, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter, who is likely to have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the European player with the most tournament wins, with 25.5 points.
“I don’t cry often, but today I can’t help it.
It was a hard year.
I am so thankful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so happy to have the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm happy to have been able to help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He passed the testimonial to fellow golfer John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday's singles game.
"It's amazing how proud I am today to have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
It is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winner of 14 majors, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled throughout the weekend to stay out of the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, for a moment, they put the Europeans in trouble.
We fight.
I took my hat off to Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to take off the hat.
They were superior.”
Red tide information: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report from the Florida Wildlife and Fisheries Conservation Commission, there is a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the commission, increasingly uneven outcrop conditions are being observed in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which may mean that concentrations are decreasing.
The red tide stretches approximately 210 km off the coast from the northern Pinellas counties to the southern Lee counties.
Concentrations can be found 16 km away from the coast of Hillsboro County, but in fewer places than last week.
The red tide was also found in Pasco County.
The presence of mid-level concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas County last week, background and elevated concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background and elevated concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, background and mid-level concentrations on Charlotte County, background and elevated concentrations on or off the coast of Collier County, background and elevated concentrations on or off the coast of Collier County has been reported.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, cases of respiratory irritation continue to occur.
No such cases have been reported in Northwest Florida for the past week.
