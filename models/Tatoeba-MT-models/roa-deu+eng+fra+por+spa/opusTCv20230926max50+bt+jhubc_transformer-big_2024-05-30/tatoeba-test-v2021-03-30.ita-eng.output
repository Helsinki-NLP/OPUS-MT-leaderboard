I don't drink alcohol.
Looks like there's no way out.
We fell asleep.
I was very annoyed by him.
Why should we help you?
I put the plan into practice.
He made a list.
For a while I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.
I think Tom's going around.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
Did you tell Tom why you want to go to Boston?
Tom and Mary are gone now.

These monks live inside the monastery.
I just have to find him.
Can I see this?
He is able to speak Japanese.
I might be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?
Tom will find a job soon enough.
Correct the underlined words.
Did you tell him you were joking?
Keep looking.
When the results are made public, I will let you know.
I wanted to go back to his village.
Tom is pleased with his success.

You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree with you 100%.
These flowers besides being beautiful also have a good smell.
He's in college now, isn't he?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember that.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you would mistake him for a Frenchman.
He came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was short.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's very unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
You're depressed.
You're wasting my time.
You're not Mary's husband?
It was all your imagination.
I'm not going to vote!
Why can't you do that?

What is the difference between real diamonds and imitations?
Could you call me later?
I would like two copies of each of these documents.
I expect I'll have to do it for Tom.
What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen more powerful than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We're all gonna die.
Tom continued to cry.
I can't do it yet.
George was out of his anger!
You misled me.
Are you willing to learn?
The poor are also people with feelings.
I'm sure Tom's just trying to help.
You smell so good.
I forgot everything about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm messy.
I know a good Italian restaurant.
We can't let him die.

What time do you leave from here?
I usually drink a lot of milk.
With a smile, anything is possible.

I never stole anything.
Tom tried to ignore Mary.
I got home late last night.
We ran out of gasoline in the middle of the desert.
Don't worry, I'll get home safe.
Ask Tom if he'll attend the meeting.
I can't run a business, it's too hard for me.
Are you learning French?
Is that your son?
Tom never asked why.
He was often up late.
I don't eat bananas often.
Get them out of here.
I've never seen them wear hats.
You know Tom?

Give me an ashtray, please.
Who found it?
What exactly did you say?
You have to go to the hospital.

You should have seen them run.
He and I were in the same camp at the time.
Tom doesn't know how much you love Mary.
I think I'm objective.
Tom hasn't heated his car yet.
I'll be happy to help.
How long will he stay?

I study at Hyogo University.
We will participate in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went smoothly.
Nobody wants to help us.
They talk very fast.
Tom was lucky at first.
It is urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He had no money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the cinema?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there a lot of sharks around here?
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
He's from Sweden.
He had no money to buy the farm.
You really believed that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with slugs.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't that funny, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20.
That's a nice picture.
I'll leave you alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom is not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom works here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I have no plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had a good time.
She's dishonest.
I read books often.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom was angry.
I'm old.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English in a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy some books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What is your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
All of you go.
Giant pandas only live in China.
I'm being followed.
You don't say things like that.
From bad to worse!
Jim is Canadian.
You did well here.
Where have all the others gone?
I'm relaxed.
The cattle were grazing in the field.
He interfered in his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom is still absent.
I ate the whole apple.
Roast the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare Uyghur food.
We're leaving Boston in the morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom played football.
Stop stuttering.
I know you.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I took that as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
You're good at this game, aren't you?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
You don't seem too surprised.
I don't go to school on Saturdays.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom is treacherous, isn't he?
Is this cage meant to protect against sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
You don't want a job?
I used to play the trombone when I was younger.
I am faithful.
Can you write in braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to become more active.
Tom and Mary are joking?
She broke the smoke.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What will he do this summer?
He became irritated.
Can you speak Shanghainese?
He narrowed it down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
He's still there with her, isn't he?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village had died after sunset.
What is your favorite female rapper?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's good to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why is he leaving early?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a conference.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who's the man playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income drinking.
Search harder on Google!
That's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does it sound familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
You're coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
You convinced the teacher.
When does your new novel come out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
He made a promise to write to me every week.
I was not born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a wealthy girl from Boston.
I forgot if he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50,000 for this statue. "Who will give more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up that way.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry up.
Tom hated them.
I miss it almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't spoken to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the car keys.
I don't really want to talk.
So it must be Argentinian.
I really like my job.
I would suggest you be more cautious.
She's shaken.
He should have done it yesterday.
I am a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
Nobody wants to help you.
It will clear up in the afternoon.
He went blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that painting?
How many are the continents of the world?
He's good at singing, isn't he?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
Your idea is superior to yours.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom's getting emotional.
I was just scared.
It's a party tomorrow.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I would like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy.
I appreciate your intuition.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drum.
It must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use the most?
Light the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German cars are among the best.
Call them.
Oh, that's cool.
Tom doesn't respect Mary's views.
You're gonna grow the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
You really think Tom's cute?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I may know someone who can help you.
Can you ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a model.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
The fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
You scoundrels!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue out.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want to do is go fishing.
Would you like to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose what you want.
I'm in the hospital, I was struck by lightning.
Did you call them?
Turn off the radio.
Why did you decide to become a teacher?
It was a really scary story.
He's in the van.
I don't introduce them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe it? We are in Europe!
I waited for a bus to arrive.
He found the bug.
You'll never guess where I am.
I didn't feel good.
You students are required to be diligent.
I won't be able to help them.
It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You are interested in politics.
Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I don't know how to drive very well.
I heard Tom's learning to drive.
You know I love you deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is, we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I cut down the branch with an axe.
Miniskirts are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least six o'clock.
I have a lot of work to do by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
You're Mary?
After dinner walk on the beach.
Why didn't you go with him?
He's two years older than him.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You got the wrong number.
Age is not a result, and youth is not a sin.
I have known him for more than ten years.
We are grateful for the music he left us.
It's not that the idea of putting an ammonia appliance in my house attracts me a lot.
Judy is a very smart student.
We knew that the dog would run after the cat.
I'm a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't I just buy her a hat?
I thought Tom would show up.
You're pale with bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom is my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like the mountains?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come on board.
You're charming.
Do people drink tea in your country?
I don't want to waste any more time.
We've lost sight of him.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Go wake them up.
Which tooth hurts?
You have to read between the lines.

I'm here to help him.
It is not easy to speak English well.
I don’t believe a word of what you say.
Get out of my way!
Only Naoko drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
You guys are vulgar.
Tom's getting better.
We can help you.
They called us.
I think Tom must be hungry.
The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
You again!
Why do these things always happen to me?
The birds are catching the ground.
The park is closed on Monday.
You haven't even updated the firmware?
I got a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do it now?
All my friends like them.
I like my language.
Why don't you answer me?
We're Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing.
Are you coming in?
Which way should I start?
Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution?
His horse had a heart attack.
It is worth visiting the ruins.
He should be ready for the worst.
Tom pulled the suitcases out of the trunk.
This reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember your license plate number?
He told us a lie.
She has seven children.
Let's listen to some music.
I think it's dangerous for kids to play in the pond.
You bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Bring it to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We have to postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't care either.
We were separated.
It's really early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
That's what happened to me.
He has many friends in America.
I wasn't living in Boston last year.
Are you reading this book tonight?
Does Tom have a car?
I'll be fine, don't worry.
Tom rarely laughs.
I can't forget his smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know any Canadians living in Australia?
Tom's boring, isn't he?
I am perfectly happy here.
You like it?
What exactly do you want Tom to do?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you wash the dishes, please?
Lunch was great.
You turned off the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered that.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
I felt the door close.
He got him drunk.
How do you feel today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You're stubborn.
I don't feel nervous.
You have a nice dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn’t even read Mary’s letter.
They were perfect.
What are you going to do this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the fox with its leap reached the quiet Fido.
Tom is engaged to my older sister.
My father is always in my private life.
Everyone wants something different.
Tom refused to carry out the order.
I know you don't like them.
I didn't know about your plan.
Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
How about going for a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Tom and Mary sing?
Are Tom and Mary okay?
Contracting is common in markets.
They shot him.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Tom was looking for his pen.
I don't want you to see this.
How many kidneys does a human have?
A dollar saved is a dollar earned.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
It went red.
Don't bother them.
We were good.
She started behaving strangely.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
I owe you money?
You want me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Tell us something.
You're random.
Please turn the music down.
I trained Tom for the job.
I watched him swim.
Who broke the vase?
You'd better go with him.
The Queen visited the museum.
Tom didn't go, and neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The children played together.
Say it again, please.
You're upsetting her.
Sami is not here to ruin your day.
I took off my shoes.
I'm learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Are those yours?
The woman drinks water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it will close soon if the food doesn’t taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free tonight.
You think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you blindfolded?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists.
You seem relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it in a second-hand shop.
Why don't you do it yourself?
It's finally here!
Tom thinks they'll all be here by noon.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It doesn't mean anything.
You're lying.
She helped him.
Everyone was talking about it.
You're telling me you're not busy?
He hates clubs.
You go home.
Tom told me Mary was busy.
Where's my money?
Nobody's seen her do it.

You're still inexperienced.
I have to go to work now.
You came too soon.
He is able to speak ten languages.
Come home before dark.
I got off the train at the wrong station.
I hated French in high school.
Shouldn't you be home with your mother?
She has blue eyes and blonde hair.
I can't understand that.
Tell him who you are.
My name sounds weird.
I will never forget that night.
Be cheerful! Add an exclamation point to all your sentences!
Can you see anything in there?
You're ready.
Why should I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.
They are traitors.
I'll stay.
I'm not always busy.
I'll assist you.
I got up before dawn.
I'll be right behind her.
How long did you live in Kobe?
We're getting closer.
Tom always says the same thing.
Did you talk to Tom?
Try to get some rest.
Do you have a Facebook account?
He asked how to cook the fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom is a golden boy.
You seem to be biased against ideas that come from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
She makes me puke.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock is broken.
I won't wait forever.
Just give the order.
Do you know any Canadians living in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom's not mad.
The rock was moved with dynamite.
Mary made breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?
He said he had to go.
You can keep them.
This smell is unbearable.
She became famous.
What are you pointing to?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
She's pointed the balloon.
We have to go.
Staying at home is no fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like your son to study more.
I opened an account in a nearby bank.
I didn't like that one.
Can you be sure?
I was glad to see you.
You don't have to worry.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He clearly wants to go.
I knew Tom was going to do something romantic.
How much paper do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom is talking to Mary on the phone.
Bring some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture in.
You are my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June is not that far away either.
Why does Tom hate it so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes got wet.
The key was left in the room.
You're gonna leave me?
You've always liked Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me some questions?
Don't make fun of Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I took risks.
Two people were killed in a car accident.
You know Tom, right?
It wasn't my idea to hire them.
Last night my grandmother passed away without suffering.
I know why you're mad at them.
You know Tom likes cars.
You passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.
I can easily read Spanish.
Should I use ink?
Don't fall off the chair.
Tom sent us some Christmas presents.
Tom can't swim?
Children usually get up early at Christmas.
I will be your guide.
How long do you study English every day?
Why does he look grumpy?
There's nothing I can do for you.
The father is good.
I think they're ready.
Tom will try it again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a board game.
Everyone believed him.
It means a huge increase in the use of air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.
I'm a drug addict.
Those are crocodile tears.
He might have said something earlier.
The work leaves traces on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I have pains every 30 minutes.
Tom is much older now.
Tom's better.
I think Tom is a pessimist.
You have to help them.
Sometimes I write to my mother.
Don't trust anyone.
I regret never being kind to him.
Get Tom to call me.
It hasn't changed anything.
You're not wearing your hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too soon.
I should have eaten more.
Of the twenty students, only one read the book.
To love someone is to see them as God intended them to be.
Don't lie to them.
They live with you?
I don't know how he did this.
I'm not sure George will like this idea.
They are afraid to say it publicly.
Please identify yourself.
You're leaving us.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I've lost him.
I almost dropped the plates.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom called 911.
We are brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
This week has been beautiful.
You want a tray with that?
You don't know me.
Nobody wants to work.
Please drive slower.
How do we fix it?
This is last month's magazine.
They haven't come back yet.
He's about your age, isn't he?
He's backwards.
We can't let them die.
It's a bundle of nerves.
Tom was late.
Tom stayed behind.
This point will be discussed tomorrow.
How did you spend your holidays?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved into the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary corrected it.
Have you ever spoken to him?
I don't think Tom will be able to do that.
When did you come back from London?
Tom is always in a good mood.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom leaned over to take a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking of getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It sounds so fake.
They're all dead.
I don't want you in my car.
A Morse Cobra Tom.
I don't care about you.
Don't say anything!
I think you're right.
He likes football.

Show them how to do it.
What is your favorite fruit?
Do you like golf?
What is your favorite type of pizza?

Bob has a lot of books in his room.
They followed Tom.

Obviously, you lied.
Something was going on.
Send it by mail.
It's interesting, isn't it?
Mary accidentally stumbled upon Tom.
I'm nobody's enemy.
I forgot your number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's an error in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to be frank?
What will you do?
Tom seems tired, bring him home, please.
May all your wishes come true!
He's already done it.
He is an expert with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, right?
Now let's talk.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit him in the head.
It'll be a lot of fun.
Tom told Mary what not to do.
Do your own business!
She was extremely scary.
I'm telling a story.
You're homesick, aren't you?
What will you eat tomorrow?
I've seen the movie before.
Sophie, who was hungry, ate everything she could get.
They're Tom and Mary?
There is no future in his employment.
Tom and I often study together.
Tom and Mary are very happy here.
Do you like to travel?
I want to go back to Tom's house.
It has strong principles.
He was buried in this cemetery.
Again, bye.
I'm so lucky to meet you here.
Are you waiting for someone?
You're an overly optimistic girl.
Is this your umbrella?
I don't know three languages.
Tom filed for bankruptcy.
We need some sleep.
We are in Calgary!
I'm strong.
The way he's doing it is wrong.
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
I speak English.
Tom and Mary are young and attractive.
I'm done watering the flowers.
Here's what to do.
Tom asked Mary out several times.
I tried to save her.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
This is my favorite song on the album.
I need to talk to him.

It is sickness to be obsessed with victory, it is sickness to be obsessed with the use of martial arts, and it is sickness to be obsessed with presenting all that you have learned. It is sickness to be obsessed with attack, and it is sickness also to be obsessed with getting rid of disease. Fixing the mind obsessively on anything is considered sickness.
We've booked seats for the performance.
These are Tom's books.
