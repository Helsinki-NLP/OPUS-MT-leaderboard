Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "making the clown figure"
There is some dismay among some members of the Assembly at the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of Parliament of Wales).
This proposal arose as a result of the plans to change the name of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly across the political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party is concerned that "it may rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who don’t live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means moron and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said he was "open" to the name change, but pointed out that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (clown).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The assembly committee, which is currently drafting the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what members of the assembly will be called will of course be a topic of debate for members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which registered broad support for the possibility of calling the Welsh Parliament Assembly.
As regards the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long said that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take into account the result of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shut while Harlem churches are in trouble
“The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“None of the two are here today.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people frequent regularly."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the estates will not last as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will go back where they started.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who won’t help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he says, “and for that reason they will hasten the time when these churches will shut down altogether because it is unlikely that much of the people who move into these apartments will become a member of these churches.”
Both churches were built by fellowships before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin’s was acquired by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem’s main shopping streets, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners planned its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin’s in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese was “trying to dump the costs” on the parish assembly even though the latter had not been involved in the hiring of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Man on Lobster Fishing Dive in California
Official sources say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving in search of lobsters in California on Saturday, the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam up to him along with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster but then "he realized the boy was screaming 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His entire collarbone was torn," he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Beachkeeper Captain Larry Giles said in a statement to the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to boost the UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with lanes dedicated to department store beauty products assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the significant push towards the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn UK beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household goods sectors decline, larger lanes dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and adopted in multiple stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are hunting for new ways to use the space on shelves once dedicated to televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of boutique makeup so that most products are vegan – a quality increasingly in demand from younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume reseller The Fragrance Shop will experience licensing at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a shift toward buying small amounts of food daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to work harder to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said retail outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain seeks to resist discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and that strategy has boosted food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to restore its beauty and pharmaceutical departments to enamel ended in failure.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets into supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, sales director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look of our beauty departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for beauty products, as opposed to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby breaks out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her trending brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for his Truly brand of household goods and accessories.
The couple's activity had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning has turned to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious after retiring from their lucrative last-minute trendy brand business to focus on her exceptional new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was “furious” when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts — worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — did not leave her enough time to devote to their Truly brand of household goods and accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and it was calculated that it would double Willoughby's estate, estimated at around <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his abandonment of Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his holiday residences.
According to a source, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It was to be her long-term future that would engage her for the next twenty years.
His decision to quit left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow Headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that leaving the host of This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions because of heavy investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and because of possible delays to the brand’s launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together and Jones owned a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity” program.
A source close to Jones said last night that he "does not wish to comment on his business affairs."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would judge “non-presidential” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "newspaper host".
"I haven't given up anything."
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first one in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not observe an “equivalent response” from the U.S. to North Korea’s first disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
“With North Korea, we are getting very good results,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the repatriation of the last U.S. military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's simple to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded camp, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, causing hundreds of deaths
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been displaced, a national emergency had not been declared, an essential requirement to activate international aid.
“In numerous cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it’s a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is still unsure whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is continually subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common structure on other coasts.
The obvious lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the alarm had been given, probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is heading to Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of Indonesia’s crumbling infrastructure at the heart of his campaign and has poured money into roads and railways.
But funding shortages have hit Joko’s administration as it prepares for re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of the religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands driven from their homes due to clashes on the roads between Christian and Muslim gangs, fighting using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge draws against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a point in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 yards from Chelsea's goal, with his team underneath 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second post.
The attempt passed high over the door frame as it turned towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga into the net.
"Just trying to get in position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I gave him a touch and I didn't think about it too much and I pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the 25th minute goal scored by Belgium star Eden Hazard.
The Blue’s forward passed Mateo Kovacic in heels before squirting away near the halfway point and shooting in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
So he made a beautiful pass that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and finished on the second pole with a left goal over Liverpool’s Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has reached 832, the country's disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Numerous people have been reported trapped in the rubble of buildings collapsed following the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and generated waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been sprinkled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people who may have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.

I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends claiming to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location of the discovery this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police said they are currently informing the victim’s family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."

Several agents were inside the delimited area checking the apartment building.
Anyone with information is invited to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating the record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "rewriting history"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many of England’s religious and cultural objects carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick’s proposal a “madness” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in light of the current debate over the removal of the statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, an advocate of parliament from outside pressures, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure who represents a part of such a fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector are to be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig Killer Smashes Chinese Farmer by Killing Him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pigsty at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs at a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province in China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door of a nearby pighouse was open.
He claimed that there was a large male pig with blood on its snout.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had shredded the farmer, according to the statements.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and jagged,” said the cousin identified with the surname “Wu,” as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people as police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer’s death.
Although they are rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They just want to play.
They are playful, very curious .... they do not want to hurt.
Just show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa Will Bring Extended Heavy Rains to the Southwest
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the coldest waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains over northern Mexico and the U.S. southwest coast in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 ET on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a rift is forming over the Pacific Ocean and it is moving eastwards towards the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push strong tropical moisture northwards in the southwestern part of the US.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day on Monday.
Thus, tropical moisture in contact with the approaching looting will create heavy and vast rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour in some places, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2.5-10 cm is expected in some areas of the southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions is possible due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rains could make the canyons of the rivers flood and the storms will bring wind puffs and raise dust.
The approaching looting will cause heavy rainfall locally on part of the southern California coast.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona toward the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more extensive at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will fall on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
There will be strong temperature fluctuations over the U.S. in October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain warm enough.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature variations over short distances.
An exceptional example of significant temperature differences in the central U.S. will occur on Sunday.
There will be a difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm start to October is expected for most of the central and eastern U.S., with 26 degrees Celsius from the Southern Plains to the northeastern areas.
In New York you can reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is a temperature of about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate high above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the compelling deposition of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for a last-minute turnaround on Friday: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford has informed the Senate Justice Committee that she is 100% certain that Kavanaugh groped her in a drunken state and tried to strip her off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during an inflammatory deposition, said he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the spectators who follow the programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, this is an audience similar to that for a football playoff game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS operators Friday morning as he was insulted by demonstrators as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for several minutes as he was scolded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think I'm telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have the power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued the statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters aired live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the allegations against the candidate over the next week, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of ‘Making Politics’ on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans of letting the European Union "make policy" with Britain's future and jeopardize national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside that with the prime minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit deal, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU must collect their respective tariffs is “absolutely ridiculous”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Suspect in Death of LSU Player Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson’s DNA on them, reports CBS affiliated WAFB television station.
After questioning Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The East Baton Rouge coroner’s office issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department acknowledged the merit of the task force for fugitives from the Louisiana state police, the police forensics laboratory, Southern University police, and the citizens of the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU Athletic Director thanked the local law enforcement for their commitment and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198-cm forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team is "shocked" and "under shock" at Wayde's death.
“That’s what you worry about at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano sprinkles with ash Mexico City
The ash leaking from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was checking the different rumbles and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash lining the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano that lies 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police teams and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists hampered by riot police targeted police officers with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
Further fighting took place during the day with police officers who resorted to batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, groups of independentists chanting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" confronted unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain high in the independentist region a year after the October 1 referendum, considered illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted by an overwhelming majority for independence, although the turnout was low, and Catalans opposed secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to halt the referendum that was taking place at polling stations across the region.
The pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer had any hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy over the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked,” she said.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement’s best-known leaders either in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest with his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in jail awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and the repression on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Crashing A House With Cars
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston marked victory
Livingston has left the Rangers stunned, relegating Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference as Gary Holt's team moved to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is therefore without a win away from home in the Premiership this season and will face next Sunday the first in the ranking Hearts, from which they separate 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continued their division win streak by remaining unbeaten for six games, with coach Holt still to see a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston squanders opportunity against incisive guests
Holt's team should have been ahead well before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow was only able to kick out of the door after entering to meet Craig Halkett's header on the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could put visitors in trouble with kicks placed.
And that’s how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a penalty kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, who was able to score from the center of the area.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated in ball possession but the host team’s defense had proven impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly hadn’t had to worry too much,
This pattern was maintained during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston game scheme.
The crosses were successive in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two penalties, after Halkett's contrast with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for foul of hand, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their playing style and collaborators have changed very little since their return to the top tier, but we have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he has been able to spur the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance in some moments with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below these standards.
He missed the last pass - only once they managed to penetrate the opposing area - and it can be considered a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan met with mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at relaxing relations between NATO allies.
They clashed over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police motivated with security reasons the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including numerous Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent provoked by a visitor considered a hero by some German Turks and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeastern area of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident came months after another cyclist died, struck by a road pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
Metropolitan police said authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Wounded During Disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a disturbance at the men's maximum security prison, the prison office said.
The riot erupted at the Long Lartin men’s maximum security prison in Worcestershire at approximately 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
The specialized agents "Tornado" were employed to manage the riot, involving eight inmates and which is confined to a wing of the prison.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Properly trained prison personnel have been deployed to contain an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer prison sentence.”
The Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot agents were called in to intervene in the prison to quell a violent riot during which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will sweep across the southwestern desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching rainy Monday evening.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks of up to 10 cm.
For areas foreign to the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be positive as the southwest is currently going through a period of drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category,” weather.com reported.
Initially the path of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land through the peninsula of Baja California of Mexico.
Rosa, who was still maintaining hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds at a top speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will hit the coldest waters of the Pacific, losing power.
So it is expected to arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected to be between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwestern area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, then heading through Arizona and into southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that may be caused by Rosa or her trawls is intense rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Such rains are expected to generate sudden potentially lethal flooding and debris flows into deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Authorities have appealed to anyone who may have captured what happened with their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered from the badness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered from the badness and anger” of the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, passionately and decisively denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing defending himself against the prosecution.
The president said Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a jurist with uncompromising precedent in public service,” he said in front of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination by talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m really busy,” he said.
"For this struggle strenuously for exceptional candidates."
Trump said Democrats are committed to “resisting and hindering.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many swept away by giant waves that hit the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 18 feet (6 meters) fell on the beach at dusk, sweeping away numerous people killing them and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, thus turning into victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster control agency BNPB, said in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit anything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The settling quakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have boosted the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extended” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "were totally paralyzed, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the areas involved.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alarm was sounded.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man in an upper floor of a building screaming in a restless way to warn of the coming tsunami to people on the street below.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
According to authorities, the army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has been reopened for rescue only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to more than 800.
It's awful.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where employees took refuge under tarpaulin shelters in the backyard of their office, they encountered scenes of devastation along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they’ve seen a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's awful.
Even as the rescue teams began the difficult operations of starting the rescue gears, there were some complaints that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations state that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And that has not happened yet.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing still held out hopes that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was pulled out of a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been stranded under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had coached two of the missing paragliding riders for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I’m carrying my emotional load,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu’s competitors, who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single gray tick instead of two blue ticks.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Robbers Steal $26,750 During ATM Refuelling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM at the amusement center and preparing to deliver more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man “snuck out behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag with the money destined for delivery.
Witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information regarding the identities of the offenders is invited to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing Saturday’s name change on Twitter, he wrote: “The person formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she will present her new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains for him a religious meaning.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We’ve gone from Kanye, which means the one, to simply Ye – the reflection of our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to "never use the military to repress the Mexican people."
Soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking hold across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of training opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the artificial intelligence industry, the U.S. is expected to double funding for AI research, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of several U.S. government groups about AI, although in the U.S. there is generally no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its program last year: it aims to be the <0x23>1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubting the budget in AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we need a new AI revolution,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next big success in the AI industry being achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the American Othello player with the highest score and subsequently served as executive at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google’s Chinese section.
Lee recalled previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be held, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders, it’s the multinationals,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI,” he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US order to create a National Commission for Security on Artificial Intelligence has not recorded activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted Sunday in a referendum on the possible change of the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its EU and NATO membership requests.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June under the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the possibility that the turnout will reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "He agrees to join NATO and the EU and to accept the agreement with Greece."
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had cast their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the door to membership of NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter head-on, not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He declared that a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would have participated in the referendum – a percentage below the turnout required.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of these 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores a goal by avoiding Brighton's entire defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton during a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem extremely easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting into the free field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated one defender before overtaking several others at the edge of the Brighton area.
He then made a left-hand pass, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-hand shot in the net.
"Aguero is having problems with his foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about letting him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were fortunate that he managed to score at that time.”
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net shortly before leaving the field.
City will fight Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who maintain an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies have taken at least one catch with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their first division title.
“Even if we play without a goal, at least we can be able to pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
Why shouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a first pitcher for Sunday, but are said to be inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such situations.
Scherzer, who would be first pitcher for the 34th time, ran a pitching session on Thursday and would be first pitcher on his normal Sunday off.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings for this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the turnout of Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is on the line in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really working on it, that's why I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “We see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using any means necessary, you can see the wickedness, the pettiness.
They don’t care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm in order to regain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control and we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resisting and hindering."
“And it’s been possible to see him in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, bad, mean and liars.”
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, unleashing loud whistles among the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I'm expecting a -- that was awful body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Don’t tolerate people who say what they think
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, it wasn’t a big surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs who were told they were not welcome, and all because they said what they thought.
My colleague Joan Ryan has been treated similarly because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all subjects similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday night meetings were exactly like that.
However, today this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and courteous" policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to party leadership.
All this began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a similar political vision began to expect a reversal of the trend on my part and that I would take positions that I would never accept, whether it was national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – they follow insults on social media asking for my withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the center and telling me that I shouldn’t be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I am certainly more fortunate than my fellow Members because the comments I make tend to be political in nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalisation of the levels of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of no confidence or modification of the selection rules, the party shrinks.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would have gone well".
But that’s not what I got into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, prompted by the carelessness of the Thatcher government that had let my high school class literally fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way bewildered by my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of what I consider to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayr climbs the leaderboard
Two late attempts may have somehow unbalanced the final result, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent’s championship day.
I'm now at the top of the standings, the only team out of ten to be unbeaten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” the coach said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said, “We need to acknowledge Ayr’s merit, they’ve taken better advantage of our opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but led the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released from the Warriors for the game, allowed the Melrose to talk the numbers and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased Ayr's distance with a penalty before, right in the middle of the time, scoring and then converting a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was laid down, and upon restarting, the Ayr jumped back to the lead thanks to a goal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's deputy captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose charged the extra man with an unconverted goal by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a clash with Climo without a ball from the penalty kick, MacPherson scored a touch down behind Ayr's advancing melee.
Climo converted, as he had done almost since the restart, after Rowe had picked up the kick from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to look for the home team's fifth goal.
Star of Still Game seeks a new career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel industry after discovering he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays alongside longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the next ninth series will also be the show's definitive and it looks like Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a source at the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving catering business."
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen route to Pacific
Sailors patrol a sealed naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coast and now in the hands of Chile after a bloody 19th-century conflict over resources is still alive, as is the desire to cross the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have perhaps reached their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and obviously is waiting for the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet to the sea under the State's jurisdiction.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president — who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year — has much to do with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly rule in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morale’s belligerent rhetoric has crushed any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep the discussions going after what happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was particularly swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able to "enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he explained.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as a political cover-up.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Will Not Happen Without Confidence in U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his nation will never disarm from nuclear weapons if it cannot first trust Washington.
Mr Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears intent on restarting stalled diplomatic talks after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri explains that it is an "illusion" that continued sanctions and US opposition to an end-of-Korean War declaration could ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington warns against issuing the statement without Pyongyang first carrying out major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is willing to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows feature the latest trend in huge headwear that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your headwear collection or completely block the sun’s rays, look no further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized headgear on the catwalks for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have made fury on Instagram this summer and these designers have uploaded their captivating creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like edge that submerged the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple - but they weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks feature stitched lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a mask and goggles, while another resembled a loose ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the huge style statements, you are lucky.
Observers of the style predict that the huge caps could get to you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats come in the wake of "The Bomb", the straw hat with a stretch more than a meter wide that has been seen on anyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that has invaded social media has sent another huge creation onto the catwalk: a straw beach bag almost the size of the costume model wearing it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle was the highlight of the spring-summer 2019 collection by Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect these great beach hats and handbags to arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the stylist has made such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued into 2018 with another set of outstanding exam scores, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective endeavors.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further higher education, their chosen careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a customized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages continue to be a popular and in-demand subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build trusting relationships with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the highest grades.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students obtained the highest grade with honors in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish obtained the highest grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as key skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, technique and mathematics) in the curricula of independent institutes and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employees indicated for the difficulty in filling jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
This is why language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of which career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will bring a multilingual person automatically ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to be able to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, particularly those in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking to 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff specializing in this area.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills for success, whatever their future.
There is no denying at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-championship opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it has yet to be determined for how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game pre-championship schedule.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly matches to prepare," he said.
The time of the rally a West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a flurry of rallies.
This is the first of five gatherings planned for Trump next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the next midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time will Trump’s rally be and how can you follow him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia online through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely discuss this week’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings, which have become tense because of sexual assault allegations with an early Senate confirmation vote pending for a week as the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main purpose of this round of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November election get some boost.
So, President Trump’s campaign said these five gatherings over the course of next week are aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we go into the busiest season of the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesperson told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, tonight’s rally could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh media coverage,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in the queue in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage to fight to keep hopes alive until Sunday’s singles
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum motion is a totally invented sporting concept in which players firmly believe and never like in races like these.
Where would the motor be now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I'd say we're keeping some of the bike," Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, four points ahead with another twelve at stake.
Americans feel they have a little wind in their favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth has been ruthless from tee to green and is setting an example.
The festive guttural screams grew louder as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to tie the scores at Game Four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt that made them win the game at the 15th hole was met with a similar shout, which tells you that he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
“You really have to worry about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four by four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the noisy crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal an eventual European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European speeches of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon joined Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was pairing up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes sunk the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could not even remotely come up.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a major lead in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, particularly Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup final day
Europe will have a solid lead in the Ryder Cup final day after finishing fourball and foursome games on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, in an attempt to retain the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an uneven American team in the morning fourball, winning 3-1.
The U.S. resisted more in the foursome, winning two games, but failed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 singles games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat downed Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even sharper 5&4.
Woods, who dragged for two games on Saturday, showed occasional splashes of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned alongside partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results expected on a pleasant and breezy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points Saturday.
They secured a gritty 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point gap to singles, though as a starter, Furyk's team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After being second best for two days, however, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea Rejects Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that maintaining the sanctions was deepening the country's distrust of the United States, which in such circumstances would absolutely refuse to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the world body's General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any compliant response from the US,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no security in our national security, and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri re-used the well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization with which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization altogether as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first-ever meeting between a US president in office and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees of North Korean security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need to "have denuclearization first" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive way and even opposes the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader announced at the U.N. earlier this week.
The minister pointed out the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the counterpart to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be dead at this point.”
But even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was noticeably different from last year’s speech at the UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to target U.S. territory with North Korea’s missiles after “evil president” Trump called Kim a “missile man” engaged in a suicide mission.
In front of the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in embarking on the path of disarmament, but said much more needed to be done and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no deadline, stating that "whether it will take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: “Compliance with Security Council sanctions must continue forcefully and without exception until complete, final and ascertained denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously endorsed sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea already three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of making “gangster requests.”
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took “compliant measures.”
He said Kim had explained to him that the “compliant measures” he wanted were security guarantees to which Trump had committed in Singapore and actions towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing manly culture of studying for whole nights fed by caffeine.
One university scholar found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He had the idea to start the course after a lecture he had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I being told this only now, when I'm in senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a dorm room, where students can select cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to be able to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior immediately.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” Czeisler added.
The culture of pride tied to the “night in the blank to study” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to lack of sleep being an ever-growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue, anxiety, he explained and should even serve to avoid gaining weight since the lack of sleep brings the brain into the mode of starvation, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student enrolled in the faculty of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course after taking one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar program of study before enrolling in this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for when they need to go to bed, as well as when they need to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression from outside the home with Dolly Menga’s goal relegating Steven Gerrard’s disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team was looking for their first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second loss in 18 coaching games leaving his team eight points short of the Ladbrokes Premiership's fleeing leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and an inspirationally short Rangers lineup never seemed able to even out.
While the Ranger now drops to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, and only behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
And there could be further problems coming for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence was treated for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown off the sidelines.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly overtook Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual lineup that tore out a point at the Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-prepared team choked their opponents on every lap.
The Rangers may have dominated by ball possession but Livingston made better use of the balls at their disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's filter pass in the first half sent Scott Pittman forward towards Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A Keaghan Jacobs in-depth penalty kick then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pull to the side on the second post.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their playing in the penalty area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he had to be given a penalty after the 15th following a clash with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers managed to shoot only twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not let himself be worried by the header of Lassana Coulibaly and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even for his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to handle a deep-seated kick by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool in choosing Menga for a clean finish.
Gerrard acted during the break replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact as the wing stuck a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself from the goal line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly into the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor objected to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton filed a final penalty call after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTENT continues... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as a Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those uncredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these earbuds you can really feel the effects of the atoms released from radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say it's really bursting right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to numerous types of cancer and are then re-injected
An experimental trial of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to numerous types of cancer, called HER2, and then these cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Berzofsky explained.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to target cancer cells worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-Trump row wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was whistled in the studio during an episode of Saturday Night Live after an inconclusive performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing her third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which she wore a MAGA cap, she began a rage against the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist!'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission against Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's filipina was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had a bad time backstage because of his headgear.
“They bullied me backstage.
They told me ‘don’t go out with that cap on.’
They bullied me!
And so they told me I’m an outcast,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I would wear the mantle of Superman because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Feel the love."
His comments generated whistles from the audience at least twice and the SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the newspaper: "A deadly silence has fallen on the studio."
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR KEEPING THE HEAD TO THE MASS."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what he is and this is just wonderful."
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) who I believe is embracing a vomiting ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper friend Snoop Dogg called himself Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and thus in the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, stating that such floors on screen often make boys believe that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt “something went wrong” and reflected on how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old co-star of Game of Thrones, has admitted to worrying a lot about this issue.
"I personally worry, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?" he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He went on: ‘What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young people think they have to be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time – how can we change things?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young people.’
During the interview he also admitted that he will not play any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones once the series ends next summer, claiming to have "ended up with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s True West revival, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that has happened with Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family in this sense, and my life from now on,” he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow, the character of Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to sources from the health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country’s traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators’ data, and speaks of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
The congresswoman denounced on Saturday the accusations against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The L.A. Democratic congresswoman said the statements were fomented by commentators and "ultra-right wing" websites.
"Lies, lies and still despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol official during a panel of experts hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and released information relating to a member of Waters’ staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and biased allegations, was in no way responsible for the leakage of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’s claim quickly generated online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that you do not have the character to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t get angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
He must not question the accuser's motives.
He must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by detractors of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to impeach Waters in the midterm election, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Huge if confirmed," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office alerted "the competent authorities and law enforcement to these biased claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their dangerous and harmful actions to all members of my staff."
Johnny English's review hits again - the spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has become customary now to search for references to Brexit in every new film with a British twist and this seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English’s action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English – The Rebirth.
Is the veiled self-irony about how bad we do the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and eyes out of the orbits has gotten his license to mess things up for the second time – and his name indicates more than anything that this is a comedic creation developed for countries of non-English-speaking cinema users.
Obviously it is the silly secret agent who despite his strange claims of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that type that contributed with a single note to the Gloria moments theme of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers snap briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humor seems pretty undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that “serious” film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems directed at children rather than adults and for me Johnny English’s crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson’s silent films when he plays Mr Bean.
The premise of immutable current affairs now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the dismay of the agent in charge, a role unfortunately very small for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that overflows the vase for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Teresa May-like character but there is not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to recall someone who has already retired.
And this means that the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a school executive in a chic establishment, but who also gives unofficial lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a School of Rock-like espionage course.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of Disasters for Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling into the network of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s cyber problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by sneaking into Volta’s luxury yacht and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to get familiar with the interior of Volta’s house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as nice and exuberant as it is, there’s a lot of children’s TV throughout the story.
The whole thing is quite modest.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies it is working out a plan for Britons to work four days a week but be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, while being paid five.
The party would like top companies to transfer the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while maintaining the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would be compatible with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, a policy review is expected to be announced."
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support a similar idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
In any case, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is not currently being discussed."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless executives" and "speculators" in businesses for public services.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour government could make “deductions” based on behavior deemed unlawful.
It also confirmed plans to include employees on corporate boards and create inclusive holding funds, so as to transfer 10 percent of the net worth of private sector companies to employees, who end up putting in their pockets annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings may or may not affect any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to uncover something that would induce them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said it while I was on my way to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what had happened, that that charge came out, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
Graham’s vote, however, seems to be carved into the rock.
“I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could stand up to a bomb-proof charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And whoever you name hasn’t been able to prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that sees the performance of a remarkable cast of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pouring into the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real purpose of the event, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But, precisely, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that there are 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to call for a call to action, or is it just another example of so-called “clicktivism”—people who feel they really make a difference by simply signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, working for a variety of different purposes.
It states that these actions have helped urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, destined to affect, by 2030, the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that protected capital funds have so far had a direct impact on approximately 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor-executor partnership committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” with a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, which asked, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and arduous journey – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of those who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to implement 'blockade' and hinder Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can, “if necessary,” resort to its own Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate for energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern fulcrum of Europe,” he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
“The economic option over Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “little versatile,” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, which for European consumers is absolutely the cheapest option.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2, an “inappropriate” pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline of 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of the pre-existing one up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a project of a purely economic nature.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have a choice of suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting in September in Moscow with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy.
The US stance triggered the negative reaction of Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of the European Union’s energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to ‘seriously consider’ running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take “serious consideration” of running for president following the midterm election.
At a city assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he is considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and put our messy government in order, and that means having a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During the city assembly Warren said his about President Donald Trump, declaring that he was “bringing this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, whom he nominated to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “It’s natural that there is a need for an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll released Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe they should run in 2020.
58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% supported such a candidacy.
The poll found greater support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing.
Other names of high-profile Democrats discussed regarding a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's Gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after he’s back, I can relate to other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm under narcotics, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support Challenge for New Asylum Policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are in a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday filed an amicus curiae brief in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged that policy, as reported by NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in the appeal Grace v. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and her violent gang sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a vast number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing rampant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed for asylum applications to undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of the particular circumstances and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates that principle,” the memorandum states.
Prosecutors also argued that the policy of banning immigrants harms the U.S. economy, stating the likelihood that they will become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is accessible to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly desperate.
“There’s a lot of tension,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little feverish baby at an evacuation center in the shattered town of Palu.
"At any moment there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
"Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, scouring their dirty personal belongings in an attempt to retrieve whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a fractured shoulder and back, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the continuous strong shocks of settling.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the sensation of the violent earthquake shaking the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
“I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Pompousness’ with ‘Advertising Propaganda’
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper, advertising the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press for propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the announcement paid by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election highlighted what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase of an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an escalating trade war that has seen them adapt their tariffs to their respective imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to target exporters to states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now increases those arrogances by publishing propaganda in our free newspapers.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of free speech and press, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Conversely, in the newsstand on the road here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese people may have on China’s problematic economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers has evaded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not state which newspaper it was.
Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
As many top Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court and stand by him in facing various sexual harassment charges, analysts have reported that there will be a negative reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
“You can’t take these things back,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for a paper published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan “November is coming!” during their protest in the Senate Hall, when Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Commission chose to pursue Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, as reported by Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats is skyrocketing,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they were already tall; it’s true.
But they could be higher, especially among the undecided electricians of the suburbs and young voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not vote despite not liking the president.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had speculated that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
“For the GOP it has become a confused whole,” former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote for the committee, the final one or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it’s also about the way Republicans handled the situation and the way they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
In any case, Americans seem to be somewhat divided between the person to believe in following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents have certainly or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they have certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they believe Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a state of drunkenness when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals during a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that derives its origins from Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional instruments.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online store of personal data is that it is completely up to the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers on staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to bring their decentralised apps to life using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not tell Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely shattered overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Leader of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the clergyman of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
The lieutenant colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, obtained recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren inaugurated a commemorative plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog, under heavy fire from the camp and the war machines".
Then he hurried to the line of fire and with the "greatest gallantry" advanced the line before he ran with a single-handed cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never live up to and something that makes me more humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he “felt really honored to play a role in the parade” and added “the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by so many people.”
MMA fans stood up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to be denied the view of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on screen.
Some remained baited after staying awake until the early hours of the morning especially for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad taste joke.”
“The government’s regulation provides that at 6 a.m. that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to switch to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," "yes."
“Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will be working on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“But there it is six o’clock on Sunday morning and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, a lot of messages came in and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you that next time it won't happen.
We’re going to limit it to five fights instead of six — as we normally do — and we’ve tried to get so much for the fans, and we’ve just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his own sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize, until he got to high school, that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on the first episode of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the host of the long-running show, has taken a series of sick months off.
Presenting himself as an outcast in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else growing up because "it was socially unacceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
He said, "Nowadays, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "took me by surprise."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so many at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that ‘I had to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father hadn’t accepted the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be around to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I hadn’t realized yet that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
“I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – swimming in front of a home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had a special meaning for him in preparation for the Olympics and still makes him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-of-form Mickelson put on the bench in Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to prevent it from becoming an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the U.S., the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, hoping to fix what’s tormenting him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the uneven course regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the path itself wasn’t daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth match, takes on the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of their 12 singles matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson’s match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the shoulder, put an arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It’s a Hall of Famer and it’s added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson on Sunday will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that never even remotely mirrored the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 losses and seven draws, though Furyk said his presence brought intangible assets to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s smart, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the meeting room,” he said.
“I also think the younger players had a lot of fun trying against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He did a lot more than just play.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good lead may soon fade away.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable chase.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama where the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal advantage, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"I keep telling myself that we had a good lead in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but by little," Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
“So history will prove to me and my team that it’s not over.
Tomorrow we have to give our best.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It's not over until the points are scored on the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who is on the other side: the best golfers in the world.”
Happy with the way his team competed on that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have outdone myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of the individual performances, which is another thing.
It’s nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re just your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, you have to bring out the best in you.
Then, you forget about your partner because he too has to go there and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look to his players for the best individual performance rather than team performance, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those big games of the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing to the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the final day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start immediately on the right foot as we did at Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain turn, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way that seems appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
“I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end,” Bjorn said of his selection for individual matches.
Germany's new military ship postponed again
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the Cold War times, but there will not be at least until next year due to faulty systems and a surge in costs.
The commission of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but worrisome post-delivery issues tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, as it should be possible to deploy the new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continued delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its overseas power, will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate Type F-125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little has been known about the reasons for the return, but German media have noted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that have rendered the ship useless when deployed on a combat mission.
The deficiencies in the software were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half the staff of the older ships of the Bremen class.
In addition, it emerged that the ship weighs decidedly too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in the light of the recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Navy is actually "in short supply of ships that can be deployed."
The official said the issue has worsened considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research on an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use their eyesight to get food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland scientists’ study will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as brown earwigs and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
Analyzing the recorded sounds by an expert will determine the frequency of bat calls and how each species behaves.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results can reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating lawns, and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
Bats are at risk due to construction and development work affecting trepoli and ruining habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can mosquitoicide paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to spot insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten skilled experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect drills and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first bat-only reserve at the Threave estate in the Dumfries and Galloway region, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The estate’s manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory.
“Here at Threave we have a vast area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats yet, so the work we do here and on the other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.”
It stresses the importance of checking bats before conducting maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal trunk could kill up to 400 females and young, perhaps wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb, or destroy their stilts.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Allegations as Lawyers Sue German Weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” claiming that people “want to advertise themselves” with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese striker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also announced Friday the accusation of paying $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
In an Instagram video aimed at his 142 million followers, in the hours following the accusations, Ronaldo, 33, threw away the statements as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Golden Ball staring at the camera.
“They want to advertise through my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but that’s part of the game.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” he added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, calling them “an inadmissible report of suspicion in the private sphere.”
The lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages to the extent corresponding to the severity of the breach of privacy, considered, probably, one of the most serious of personal rights in recent years."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would have kneeled down after the incident, saying he was "99 percent" a "good guy" disappointed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual relationship, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga said she went to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement as she felt “terrified by retaliation” and worried about the prospect of “being publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old now tries to overturn the deal, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he will join Italian Juventus with a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK “could forever regret” the loss of its status as a world leader in car manufacturing following Brexit, said Industry Minister Greg Clark.
He also said he was “concerned” by Toyota UK’s statements to the BBC about Britain’s eventual exit from the EU without a deal and the resulting temporary production shutdown at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automaker claims that border delays, in the case of a no-deal Brexit, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
It raises concern in other British automakers about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern is the risks in the supply chain faced by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European suppliers for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the borders that would cause delays and shortages of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark said May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely designed to avoid these border disturbances".
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to enjoy not only the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, in the long run, it warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant’s trade union delegates, says workers are deeply concerned: “In my experience, once jobs are cut, they are not reinstated.”
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for a week” as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the president’s possible obstacle to justice.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy justice minister, thus putting Mueller’s independence at risk, has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and try to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and it was rumored that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced for Wednesday a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of investigating the FBI’s claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate’s final vote.
On Sunday, Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess it will be postponed another week considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press.”
Some journalists may dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a briefing with the press at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace has asked for the reason.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings is not due to an aversion to television journalists “bringing themselves on display,” though he said, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they put themselves on display.”
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
"The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him," he said, adding without citing evidence: "We've checked the numbers."
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
Let’s try to do that, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, perhaps, the president proved the reason for this by giving a speech that was freewheeling, and at the same time bizarre, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to European workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU staff working at Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MEP Jeane Freeman has sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the costs of settled status applications for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: “Throughout the summer there have been continuous negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British government has also prepared itself in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate my appreciation today for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and expertise that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare services, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly wish you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery following a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31-27, The Tennessean newspaper Mike Organ reported.
Technical Director Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred just before the break.
“He got close to the edge of the field and fainted,” Reed said.
First responders and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the field, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him away for further investigation.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "no word is yet on the type and extent of the damage" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five tackles before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Labour plans.
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters
The stamp tax increase will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The seal tax increase will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional resources will support the Government’s initiative to combat the homelessness phenomenon.
The surcharge, which adds to the current stamp tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let real estate, could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury expects the maneuver to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-UK citizens, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the country's richest areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to help younger people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by hoarding land without using it, and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain’s “real estate misfortune.”
MEP Corbyn has announced a staggering array of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and the elimination of evictions without blame.
It also wants to give the council more powers over the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said that I would be committed to re-establishing the British dream, namely that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a home was equally easy for people who do not reside in the UK and for foreign companies, as it is for British workers residing in the UK.
For many people the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland’s technical director, Jack Ross, says his “highest aspiration” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scot is drawn to the challenge of lifting the Northeastern team, which is currently third in League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after driving St. Mirren during last season's Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I was in Serie B and that’s it,” Ross told the BBC’s Scottish programme Sportsound.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it’s something I’ll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as the manager of a team.”
Ross' predecessors to Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he feels no anxiety about following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League.”
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team back on track."
Ross began his managerial career three years ago, after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a deputy coach at the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa escape from relegation to third level and led St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than during his football career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
“I really thought that the role of manager was meant for me, rather than the role of a player.
It seems strange because I worked well, earned a living and had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to deal with weekly.
I still deal with them in terms of work stress and pressure but the management seems good.
I’ve always wanted to direct and now I’m doing it, I feel so much more peaceful than I’ve ever been in my life.”

According to a study, the right time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heatwave brought more revenue to struggling English pubs and more concern to catering services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, while restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consulting firm, put the data together and commented: “The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England at the World Cup meant that the month of July followed a similar path to that of June, when pubs were above 2.8 percent, while restaurants were hit hardest.
The 1.8 percent drop in catering in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which most people drink were the strongest, with a homogeneous increase greater than the decline of restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered from the heat, although not in an excessive way as the restaurateurs.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent in the month, while food consumption fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s Recreation and Hospitality Analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent annual drop in sales will be particularly heavy in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurateurs and only the weather can tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce.
Global sales growth among pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand roll-outs.
The sales tracking company Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants brings together and analyzes performance data across 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry’s reference company.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11 years old, owns secret social networking accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Instagram” pages
The news has reinforced fears that sexual content will be posted.
20 percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create social networking accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake Instagram” accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has reinforced fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they run a clean “main” account to show their parents, while keeping one private.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, from the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of private schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping accounts private.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘voice for athletes’ on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive member of the board of Scottish Athletics during the national general assembly of the administrative body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys deep respect in the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland athletics could take a huge advantage by bringing her on the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of athletes and hope to be able to contribute and help drive sport in Scotland.”
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, and currently a BBC commentator, found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job but I recovered completely, he learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
The advertising of a breast pump compares mothers and cows and divides online opinion
A milk pump company has divided opinion online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is termed the “world’s first silent and wearable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ad in the form of a playful music video to show the freedom of expression as mothers given by the new breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, "Yeah, I'm throwing my milk but I don't have a thing" and "If I hadn't noticed, these aren't breasts but my boobs."
The choir continues: "Take him out, take him out, I feed the children, take him out, take him out, I throw milk to my ladies."
However, the advertisement, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy on the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video aroused different reactions among viewers, many of whom argued that it highlighted the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s an unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their young are stolen from them a few days after birth,” someone wrote.
The breast pump Elvie is worn discreetly under a bra for moms
Someone else commented: “Understandably traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who will continue to keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "It's really nonsense advertising."
Others defended her, and one woman even admitted to finding the song “funny.”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I wish I had one.
When I used the breast pump, I felt just like a cow.
The advertising is a bit irreverent but it doesn't get very far from reality.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a fun advertisement dedicated to mothers who use the breast pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows.'"
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
In the end the protagonists of the video show that they have danced with the discreet breast pump stuck in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie breast pump is however completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be tucked into a breastfeeding bra giving women the freedom to move around, hold babies in their arms and even get out while pulling milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who use the breast pump to cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast pump is able to ensure.”
This isn't the first time milk pump Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children showed up on the catwalk of the designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved silently to a tent city on the border of Texas
The number of migrant children has risen exponentially even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and political line has made it more difficult to keep these children.
The majority of those who took them into their care were mostly illegal immigrants who are now afraid of jeopardizing their ability to remain in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and that data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to take care of single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Almost 80% of the people who offer to take in children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are criminal aliens.
So we’re continuing to hunt down these people,” Albence said.
To try to prosecute children faster, officials have introduced new rules that some of them will have to appear in court within a month of being arrested, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to workers at reception points.
Many will appear by videoconference rather than in person, to plead their legal status case with an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for assistance will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children remain in foster care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or attempts to escape, according to those who work at the shelters and the reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the likelihood of this occurring is even higher in a large structure such as that of Tornillo where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for the signs of discomfort of children to be ignored.
They add that moving children to the tent city without giving them time to prepare emotionally or greet friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are occupying Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to “fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and supporting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions are favorable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "increasing unfounded fears" that drive refugees away from their homeland.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
“What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid for reconstruction in Syria will not be allocated until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached that will allow an end to the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented an extended attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target the jihadists, including fighters of the al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will win the second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers perhaps hope, his presidency has to end prematurely because of an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential final ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of spectators bending.
Since 2014, primetime rates have more than doubled to $1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to $1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed the network's percentages by reaching 3.5 million viewers on the nights with the most important news.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something explainable,” says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a brilliant comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
Reminds me of a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He replied, “Because it makes me laugh.”
Chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television show, the plot of the Washington affairs may determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite or not, and the state of health of the global economy.
Stopping to follow the news is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond their duty as informed citizens to find themselves following for the sixth hour in a row a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s in-depth research for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment full of recklessness” commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Daniel Stormy makes.
I won’t be able to watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of the reason it looks like a reality show is that there's news every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars," about the actors' rotation and the day-to-day developments in the Trump show's plot (as opposed to N.F.L. praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, or you'll fall behind.
This week I went to visit Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and despite being a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in the house watching MSNBC and in the meantime recording CNN.
He couldn’t get off TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented, "I remember when we once did all those crazy programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Influx of external money in the run-up to the tightest midterm elections
It is no surprise that there is an influx of money in the 17th district due to the realignment of a congressional district that has caused two incumbents to now race for the same place.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburgh brings Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb to the scene, who took his place in another district during a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that in the old districts, electoral colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the 17th district sparked a campaign of fierce opposition between the two major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a measure victory in the March special elections for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That spot had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political commentators have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. thought about penalizing El Salvador because it supports China, then changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting took place between Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization’s leadership group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to reinstate the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the “recent decision not to recognize Taiwan any more,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received from the Americans about $140 million in aid for drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been worrisome for the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and murders.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September senior officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thus definitively waiving any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, demonstrating the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further messages of rebuke or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, anonymously, about internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who wanted to remain anonymous.
Study the history
In his report, special counsel Robert Mueller may accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, a fact of which there seems to be enough evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller’s investigation intends to shed light on Trump’s possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress passed to the Democrats, Trump would have to respond to these accusations in front of voters and perhaps a jury of his peers just as he prepares for a new candidacy.
There are many unknowns and I do not mean to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as is not that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
On that occasion, we failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing different situations at the moment.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s position has been complicated since this very newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested subjecting Trump to interceptions, questioning his ability to hold the role of president.
Rosenstein argues that the news in The Times is not true.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, in the midterm elections will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to answer for his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think that we will make it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, she moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future.”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunities to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal due to a knee injury, he believes this result will allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We faced the game convinced we were doing well and we brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents got a good result in the last game. I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be able to disappoint.
“Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and the changes at the club level, but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in good shape, the boys have fun and the preparation goes well.
So we can forget about last season’s problems and think about the future.”
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term care
Although survey respondents have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the issue in the family.
About half of those surveyed by Nationwide say they have talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% say they’ve talked about it with their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide, “People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t face this conversation.”
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate in time what you want.
If you have a counselor, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be decisive for the costs.
Involve a financial advisor who can advise you on how to pay for the expenses you face.
Choosing long-term care financing can include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life policy with ransom value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all the necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can oversee medical care and make sure the professionals meet your wishes in case you were unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a power of attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid in case you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the details: imagine your elderly parent being rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down this information in detail so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just a matter of finances, but who are the doctors?” asks Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be prepared for any eventuality.”

He is not in any way in danger of death and the police are looking for witnesses.
Category: Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people have died in the aftermath of a massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The death toll is set to rise.
Communications have been disrupted and rescuers have failed to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that lies near the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood for the economy of Central Sulawesi province and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit western Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone known as the Pacific Belt of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people remembering the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting the arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she ripped her phone from her hand.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bail was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin faces three counts of first-degree felony, imprisonment for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony punishable by one day in detention and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of reporting the crime, and possession of a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ groups in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communications grids are down and the death toll is set to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck off Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of impact are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the town of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors Demand Extraordinary Death Penalty for Suspects of Terrorist Attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the perpetrator of the terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has never been imposed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to plunge onto a bike path along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by hitting pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the conditions for the death penalty claim in the southern district of New York, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and equally “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts that included eight counts of murder with criminal association, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and car destruction.
The attack required “real planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the southern district of New York prosecuted the last death penalty case.
The man sued, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and indicted for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police say he was proud of what he did in front of the investigators.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told authorities he decided to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As for the 22 counts, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and life imprisonment without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s group of defenders had previously urged prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Tory Member of Parliament Says NIGEL FARAGE Must Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to “mobilize the People’s Army” during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of Theresa May’s party MPs suggested he should handle negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians must “feel the pressure” from eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK “would already be out of Europe” if Farage were the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party have been underscored by the Tory supporters of staying in Europe who participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The prime minister is trying to implement the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and “chaos.”
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to leave the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should be entrusted to Farage.
“We would be out of Europe by now,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan.”
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country.”
Bone rejected the view that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in Europe is completely false.”
Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter, also took part in the parade and told reporters: “I simply tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it and does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who roam the streets in search of votes to allow us to be elected.
Forget the Chequers Plan and start listening.”
In an incisive message to May, he added: “Prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises.”
At the rally, Farage said politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they intend to betray the decision made with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to feel the pressure on our political class who is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the people’s army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Tory against the Brexit flags after the group formed this weekend.
The Labour party mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic senator on Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that he could challenge Trump in 2020 had been in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intends to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for "women to go to Washington to settle the government and this implies that a woman holds the highest office."
Arrest for murder of LSU Sims player
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday, he released a video of the murder asking for help in identifying a man visible in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in his death,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the crime scene holding a weapon and hitting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and held in custody at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
A nearly two-metre junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played 32 games, including 10 as a starter, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of team-mate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately apparent that the Mercedes team’s orders would heavily affect the race.
From pole, Bottas started well, leaving Hamilton to defend against Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stops first at the pits leaving Hamilton in the traffic of the group tail, a move that could be decisive.
Mercedes made a stop the next lap, returning to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tried to prevent his passage inside, risking to end up outside after a double shift to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap he is already seventh on his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for most of the race without stopping at the pits for the tyre change and tries to finish quickly to overtake Kimi Raikkonen by winning fourth place.
In the end, however, he has to make the pit stop on lap 44 and in the remaining 8 laps he is not able to increase the pace and pass Raikkonen, who comes fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri worked very well all weekend and he was really nice to let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job of securing first and second positions,” said Hamilton.
A Bad Example of Body Language
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein over her insistence that she failed to reveal the contents of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “mean, bad and liars.”
"What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, petty, bad and lying," he said.
“When there are obvious signs that the news is being spread and the perpetrators say, ‘Oh no, it wasn’t me.
I could never do that."
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document? - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn’t,” she added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the contents were released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion leaked from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations of Professor Ford, but I did not reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did."
But his denial is not credible for the president, who during Saturday night's rally commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but this is the worst example of body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of attempted sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they harm, who they have to go over to regain power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants were immediately ahead of two shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to the draw before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third loss of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe who on Friday night in Belfast had come back and won the game with the Dundee 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored his first goal at 3:35 on assist by Kendall McFaull, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on assist by David Rutherford.
In what was a pretty lively first half, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided Cownie with the draw assist at 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team rematched and Bouchard regained the draw after a strategic maneuver at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that brought the Dundee to the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and decreed his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight Controller Dies to Allow Hundreds of Passengers to Escape Earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he died to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing as a result of a massive earthquake that struck Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong settling shocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the town of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the frightfully swinging control tower at Palu’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This is really sad news for us,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands and the national disaster countermeasures agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is set to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many more," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves of up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Stores are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its utmost to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army men: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation activities.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says there is one missing after lagoon crash
The airline of the flight that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to escape, now claims that there is a missing person.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
The local boats made it possible to rescue the other passengers and crew after the crash occurred while the plane was attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were admitted to hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy say the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Witnesses say the plane crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very low altitude.
“And it was really a fortune,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, managed to reach the plane's emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he was hit slightly in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, some sailors who were working nearby to fix a jetty also provided relief using a dinghy to carry people to shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
The Aviation Safety Network data indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in aircraft accidents of airlines registered with PNG but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the burned woman alive
Prosecution’s evidence in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 ended Saturday.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cellphone data to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she had recovered location data from several cell phones showing that, contrary to what she said, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claims to have been with friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford confirmed that he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He deleted her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its concluding argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to pass to the jury at the latest on the same day.
The High Breed: What Is Aware Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting in their songs positive messages.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip-hop moved away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to the roots and make a conscious hip-hop genre again.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing them with a "racist" text
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for dismissing her in a discriminatory manner after she accidentally received a text in which her mother complained that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist by comparing the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK," Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "embarrassed" fired Ms. Maurice saying she was not happy with their previous nanny, an African-American, and that she expected a Filipino.
He paid Ms. Maurice for her day's work and sent her home in a taxi.
Maurice sued the couple and, for being fired, seeks compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want them to understand that they can’t behave like that,” he told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by stating that Maurice's dismissal was the only thing to do as they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent her a message saying something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you entrust your children to someone you’ve been rude to, even if by mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that his wife has given birth for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't gossip about a person that way.
It’s not very kind behavior,” the financial adviser added.
While the lawsuit is still pending, the court of public opinion immediately sued the spouses on social media criticizing them harshly for their behavior and the logic they followed.
A letter reveals that the Paddington publisher feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter: "It's not easy to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It’s fun now that we know Paddington’s great success.”
Claiming that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the toy bear-inspired children's book, would not have reacted well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father was modestly proud of her success.
“He was a fairly quiet man, not a presumptuous person,” he says.
But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like a son who reaches a milestone: you’re proud of it even if it’s not your fault.
I think he interpreted Paddington’s success in this way.
Even though it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the credit to Paddington himself.”
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my daughter who was dying
At the landing the daughter was transported urgently to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really bad and that our daughter would not make it,” says Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then she called me to tell me she was going to die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly fading.
She died a while ago and that was the end.
I had to sit and wait knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
“Nobody knew,” he says.
“All I did was cry with my head down.
It’s hard to explain, but while on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two sad women’s tickets to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide work hard to prevent others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached on a bridge in Wales cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she says.
Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that it illuminated every room it entered.”
But before he died, he quit his job because depression had taken him “to a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I continue to fear that a chain effect will occur."
He created the tickets “to let people know there’s someone they can turn to to talk to, even if it’s a friend.
They don’t have to isolate themselves, they have to talk.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after the death of his mother.
“You never said he felt down or depressed,” she says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
Christmas Day hit the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, he avoided looking them in the eye."
He says that his death was a huge trauma that they had to elaborate: "It tore the family apart.
He ripped us to pieces.
But we had to move on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Is Uncertain: FBI Starts Investigation
"I think if we could proceed as he asked, that is with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "losing its cool" because of the blockade of rooted supporters.
Why does Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections, on November 6, and if the Republicans as expected get a negative result, they will be heavily weakened in their attempt to elect the man they chose for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called on the senators to press for support for Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
It will vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the delays and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean political refugees 'declines' with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge from South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, says there were 1,127 refugees last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park explains that the main reasons are tighter control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs demanded by those who illegally let these people out.
Pyongyang did not make any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal emigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about the denuclearization negotiations that are in a stalemate.
This follows the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States we cannot be certain of our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit for Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he isn't fit for the job.
Pelosi expressed this opinion Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I think if a woman had behaved the same way, they would have called her hysterical,” Pelosi said of Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Visibly excited, Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in a state of emotion, almost screaming and with his throat squeezed in tears as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats who called the charges against him a “coordinated and absurd defamatory campaign” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has proven to be biased against Democrats.
"I think he's self-excluded with his statements and the way he talked about the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to indict Kavanaugh if confirmed and if the Democrats were to reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I think if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only not fit for the Supreme Court, but also not fit for the court that presides now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh evaded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said: “You cannot send a hysterical and biased person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be accepted in a positive way.”
And women have to use it.
It is a fair diatribe, months and years of attacks of anger from which he cannot get out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And he continued, "It helped me a lot a woman who was a manager somewhere. She told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it went on.
I thought it was a brilliant idea.”
Tears are tolerated as an outflow of anger in part because they are fundamentally not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office goes back to when I once started crying over an outburst of anger. A woman older than me, an ice manager I had always been slightly terrified of took me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let yourself be seen crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they have you in their hands.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his run for president.
In 1987, when a boat called Monkey Business discovered Hart's extramarital affair that she had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she shouldn't try to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t really a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing about 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and we certainly didn’t need another one.
Some called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already in its late stages, Schroeder was late with the fundraising and swore she would not run if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost cause in the beginning.
She found that some of the supporters who had given the men candidates $1,000 to her would only give her $250.
“Do you think I can get a discount?” he asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives, and anger at the sex discrimination she was a victim of) that she was moved.
“It looked like I was in the throes of a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled thinking about the reaction of the press.
“Someone might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
Maybe "he cried a lot."
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening blows of the U.S.-China trade war have been loud and, while the battle is far from over, experts say a clash between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump has already issued the first warning this year taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on items worth more than 200 billion dollars (175 billion euros), which means that taxes will be applied on half of Chinese goods.
Beijing has reacted each time with measures of the same type by recently applying tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. blow by blow and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon back down.
For Washington to give up, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but to bow publicly to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US can positively affect China in the long run by decreasing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create the initial conditions for an economic collapse in both countries is in fact far more dangerous than has been recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher studying Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
According to the UN estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he will not accept any conditional aid or from those countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water at the sixteenth hole of par 3 granting the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his rounds becoming one of the four players ever to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament under the current formula was played for the first time in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has surrendered for 2&1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran, Spain’s Sergio Garcia, who played eight of them, has become the most successful European player in the tournament’s history with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so glad I won the cup.
It’s a victory for the team and I’m happy to have made my contribution,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Ram who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods with a score of 2&1 in Sunday’s singles.
“If I think I grew up watching his matches, I’m really very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods,” said Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now counts his Ryder Cup games to 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think that he is one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been trying all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of these guys because they fought.
At one point this morning we put pressure on the Europe team.
We threw away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players behaved very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I’m fond of these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
We've put all of it into it.
They played better than us.”
Red tide update: concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in red tide concentration in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchy flowering conditions, suggesting a decrease in concentration, are evident in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
The red tide bloom extends for about 130 miles of coastline from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
The patches are about 10 miles off Hillsborough County but in fewer areas than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
A low concentration in Pinellas County or off its coasts, a low to high concentration off Hillsborough County, a low concentration to a high concentration in Manatee County, a low concentration to a high concentration in Sarasota County or off its coasts, a low concentration to a high concentration in Charlotte County, a low concentration to a high concentration in Sarasota County or off its coasts, a low concentration to a high concentration in Charlotte County.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No cases were reported in Northwest Florida last week.
