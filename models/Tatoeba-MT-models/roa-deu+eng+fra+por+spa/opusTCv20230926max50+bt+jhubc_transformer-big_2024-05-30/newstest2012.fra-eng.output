The Parliament did not ratify the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, in the context of an amendment to the criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph concerning the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs rejected on second reading the draft amendment aimed at reducing the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors to freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having concluded an a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the sentenced woman's appeal in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the regime's political revenge judgment and has provoked a process of suspicion of court bias also to the west.
The draft to annul paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members of Parliament.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual Sharia law and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a robbery you cut off your hand.
Women can forget emancipation, any disrespectful of its faith are punishable by capital punishment...
It is the Quran that will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot imagine and would surely not like.
But our way of life is not unique, objectively not the best, and probably not beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly astonishing that Islamist warriors accepted the help with recognition of infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with each attack.
When it comes to finding the winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without it bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crusaders".
Without land occupation, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of a selfless protection of human rights.
As long as we can stop these Shari'a followers.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eyes of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states published the GDP information for the 3As.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are looking not only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistical offices in the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries earlier published their economic development visions for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, while France's is projected to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (the cause of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts had predicted.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter according to forecasts and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The yield on ten-year bonds is 28.45%
Bond yields in Spain and Italy are climbing to critical limits.
The problems are beginning to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% as the situation worsens in the region.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantee of last resort .
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The representation of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has dearly defended with also a good share of luck in the second part its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification to the European Championship.
The Montenegrins found themselves under pressure until the second half because of a precise Czech defense.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a 200 million crowns prize in the Czech football box.
From the first minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams were struggling to make combinations and the game focused mainly around the center line.
The pressure from the national footballers did not manage to break through the Czech defence which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
Students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan created a human shield Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Isfahan where uranium is processed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest report that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where the uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: does not take breakfast and takes cold cuts for dinner
More than a third of children ages 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, 9% of schoolchildren will be above average weight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows again how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround him is.
On the tables of obese children, for example, we find charcuterie 50% more often than in the families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had French fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of the fat little ones sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and involved 900 primary school students in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever company.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from the sixth to the third year have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the absence of proper nutrition and insufficient physical exercise.
"Only half of the children surveyed say they eat breakfast five times a day - in case - lunch - snack - dinner, which is one of the basic principles of good nutrition," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and cold cuts at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of student families eat at my same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been noted is that one-tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that the families of obese children consumed unhealthy fries more often.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned do sports regularly but for the parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare Your Food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food based on their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes there are many cakes, meats and sweets.
“The most alarming thing is a high preference for sweet lemonades,” the survey found.
For lunch it was the pasta that took the first place in front of the white meat.
The children did not want starch at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Focus on health
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a control of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the 'Obesity is not a coincidence' awareness session, we witnessed a well-determined willingness to move towards healthy eating," the survey results indicate.
The most striking was for example with regard to sweet lemonades as children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce the sweet dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech specialty of breadmeal or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn’t think about what would happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information are waiting for us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "crazy".
This time we have with the director Alenka (in the course there is no boy) dealt with how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, with no particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically reduce wide arms, extend a neck or add the necessary curves.
We came to emphasize the character nicely and also not to dress too conspicuously types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If there is, for example, a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that skirts or trousers do not pass at all, it is worth having it made to measure.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is invaluable.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in one that slips permanently, rolls up and doesn't fit the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I am also afraid that in regard to what I have to do at home there is too much.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We have to take into consideration the current appearance, the type of fashion of the personality as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress"Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know from the campaign Victoria's Secret.
Deep down, it makes me happy, because it's better than dressing up Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred kilos lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic design.
Thinking about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not dress only the physical but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphic designer, told us all about it.
But this,... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse look to Saturday’s session filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with only one outfit in a different way.
Variability is the key to this example.
Like for example this trench coat that has to be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with pumps and take pictures like a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or the collar and have a new look immediately.
“Play with it,” he said.
But I particularly enjoyed the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
“You can then start to break it,” Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with them, towards what, why, when in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No word on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have many more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I must be ready to "retail" at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality.
We have to rely on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half of the success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of stylists remains frivolous.
And known faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seem to go second).
And if someone gets a styling from us, we must then rely on the fact that they dictate to us with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one they actually have.
Then we just have to google and make sure if the Boulevard news mentions the celebrity in question, if she has lost weight or become fat etc...
Honza and Mario asked us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he dresses and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter themselves, keep their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort her closet and fill it with new items you can't throw it all away and say, 'My God, what a horror.'"
"You'll find some things that you'll find pretty and him you'll advise with what to wear them with," Mario says.
This one showed us concretely what must all contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
This is the one you hang around the waist and have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to things clearly defined as scissors, rollers for hair removal or nanny pins, there are also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staples it could not be cut well).
So that we were not only people who listened but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, a fortiori on the outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently injure ourselves.
We really need skills.
Mario was delighted when he congratulated me on my creation.
The attention I'm giving isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of classes
I am beginning to understand more and more that making a styling profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed The Run is being fought across America.
Revision
Originally a run without problems is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with it in a routine morning commute to work.
It fulfills to some extent everyone’s ambition but it is useless if no one wants to do anything more.
The new part subtitled The Run produced high expectations before its release.
It promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed racing series and release a kind of game from the playable parts that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the added passages will be where the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already being done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole pulls down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really errors but rather the expression of an incomprehensible sloth on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
The result is that each race is done on a different route and the planned stages in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also pretty nice even if the graphical technical level is the same as the previous series.
It's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very visually enjoyable.
The tests are also occasionally embellished with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly decreases your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition to this, the different races are well arranged one after the other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then another duel with an opponent awaits you.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle passages.
This is more of an interactive animation when Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help him by hitting the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is quite like this because this element does not risk to hinder and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that embellish the game.
The driving pattern is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but we can not say that it is negative.
As for the realistic simulation you will have to look elsewhere.
But although we can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything is ok.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not yet complete.
We don't expect this game to be a complicated warp and collisions, but when you don't have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, so it's not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy turns.
Or it ends up in crumbs.
Thanks to the reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you have broken your figure or you have gone out in the scenery the game takes you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really rely on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and you have to find the solution by remembering the piece of itinerary in question.
The great thing about this game is that the same actions end up in the same places.
For example, there are certain turns that you have to pass in a certain way otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise you encounter on a given place "civilian" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds early or a minute late.
What makes you angry are the situations when you see the opponent easily pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and bypass them or brake.
It doesn't matter if you go to meet him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always arrives very close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
During all the time of the game, you, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This annoys the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long deck in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a lot of times.
It can be understood that the purpose of this game is to make something captivating and full of adrenaline,but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn’t matter if it’s because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is to change the car during the races.
You should pay attention to gas pumps on the routes because you can change cars there but most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American displacements for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic outfits on very technical driving for example on lace roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which are races in particular places that you know from the adventure, goes very well with the main diet of the story.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog function which among other things compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult moves to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you arrives a subway train that sends you the car directly to the scrap.
In writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought when creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra,but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is troubling is that in more extreme situations, the imaging does not hold up and in some cases tragically.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is to choose from.
In order to please the most and especially the young audience a new soundtrack has been created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Need for Speed: The Run is a great game.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really good but be prepared for mistakes to hit you in the eye with the force of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs Behave Like Negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a hard war.”
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all the players get used to their new role," Milena Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different EU bodies and their relations in such an understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers at Charles University Law School might envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, there was a resounding criticism that he is faded, that he is a leather roundabout, that he can't fulfill any mission and I have to say that he has taken everyone's breath away because he plays his part perfectly."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicates well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take of Europe."
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "Which phone number should I call?", thus as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater legibility of the Union's policy towards states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also referred to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs have solved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
It called the fall of the government very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "activity has been at its peak" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now.
In addition, the new septimal budget of the Union must be approved, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be slim and in view of savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the framework of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, bananas differently large or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky.
She wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the EU institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, according to her, stems from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter and little support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me: 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?' and he is not happy at all."
According to Vicenova, in the near future, new tough fiscal policy rules await the member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the euro area."
“We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute for enhanced cooperation.”
In the first place it was said that the countries that want it and those that do not want it remain in their corners.
"There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be a really two-speed Europe," Vicenova said.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues having an impact on the EU should be debated among all EU members and not only members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
IBM Innovator Begins Second Century of His Existence
If someone were to search for the word that most closely expresses IBM's strategy, the closest would be "the long term."
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a company felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The foundation for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm’s first chief executive, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved as long as people are willing to think.
His slogan "THINK!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of Watson's carefully crafted corporate culture.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it has always remained true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change everyone else around it.
This has enabled us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more"said for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, took care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacation, employer-paid insurance plus a stylish employee uniform and a well-crafted system of rewards for inventors and merchants.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was initially great at discovering talent – as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus had a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman – Virginia Rometty – who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has worked at IBM for 30 years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing what is called jamy, online brain-storming from which many future strategies and innovations have come.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a secure position in the business field.
“In the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,” said Geogre Colony, a Forrester Research Consulting firm.
As the firm itself says there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiarly called in the United States with regard to its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the world's largest firms.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the product level from server to nanotechnology.
She holds numerous patents from all American technology firms and five of her employees have been awarded a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries is for example the ATM, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the floppy disk.
IBM was this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example has not succeeded in betting on a clean OS/2 operating system, the online Prodige service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on the advancement movement you can’t emotionally hang on to the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem to build its foundations on many platforms and when they do not work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor which at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are made up of one-fifth of software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However still in 1990 it was with more of the shareholding the strongest representative of hardware.
Beginning in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during which period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis.
IBM trades according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
Does it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of IBM shares has progressed from 2008 in rocket 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of IBM is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect that this flexible giant will overcome other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was renamed IBM in 1924 - originally a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the Supervisory Board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the firm’s founder – Watson’s ideas have been the foundation of the company’s identity and culture to date.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, revenue multiplied to $9 million and the firm began expanding to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of leadership it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos – on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the Consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been successful at IBM for the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited such as transport and city management.
As for the field of commerce IBM has recently developed a platform "Smarter Commerce" that helps salespeople manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivete you can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for the future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova asylum in her house in the summer, she did not suspect that her couple would not hold out.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push the singer back.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
Over time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband sleeps with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
“He’s the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out.”
“He will no longer be my beloved and lost old ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship,” Rychtarova leaked, showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is no problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I will stay with Iveta and will not change."
“My wife set up a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we talk in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he will not prevent it.
“We don’t sleep together and I’m not interested in where she’s going, with whom and if she’s having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take on all the responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Women’s Worst Vices: Is This Affecting You Too?
If you ask men to determine vices typical of women, all of them, both of them, are able to get them "out of their sleeve".
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of female vices that manage to pump the blood of the veins of men.
The purchases
Does your half make any remarks that you are addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a week?
Are you happy to buy and packages at the time of sale?
In your case we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which would resist the shop window of clothing stores, to look for yourself nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (ideal of different colors)?
And while for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he or she is waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
“I would need to lose at least 5 pounds – should I start exercising?”
"Do you like me?"
Don’t these phrases remind you of something?
Oh, yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It’s not the issue that you should stop taking care of yourself but a lot of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about their appearance.
The strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints increase, the more women become poisonous.
The odre and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Wash the windows, vacuum, clean the floors, dust, strip the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have soiled the sink, dirty the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness, however, can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The Work of Sape
"Put this worn-out sweater in the trash."
"Are you going to put on those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do on your partner this sap job this way several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have to do so much dirty work.
Defamation, Persiflage
Defamation, persiflage but also insults against someone are also typical of some women.
Women are particularly inclined to relationships and thus are content to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us is letting out a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is a special feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persevere, even despise others and are especially dangerous for their entourage – especially at work in a group of women.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey forward Jagr twice participated in Philadelphia's win during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again leading the Czech productive players for the competition.
From the point of view of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made one more pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told journalists from overseas that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," explained Jagr after his action Giroux scored a goal in the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind Hurricanes goals for the pallet and presented it to goal scorer Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds scored a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t mean he’s the best player in the league but he’s really one of the top three,” Jagr said of his center.
“I never thought I’d play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him.”
“I’m really happy with that.”
“I want to play on him.”
"All these years in the NHL the other players in the team have been trying to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended up two-on-one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the pallet, I took some speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I made it," he describes the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he came out in the second third because of an injury in the upper body.
The Candians did not hold out against an experienced defender their two-goal lead lost after a penalty shootout by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than the lost fists as they played the game with only 5 defenders.
"It sucks."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Jacques Martin.
“Replacement on replacement was not enough and we couldn’t resist.”
“We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area.”
For that we had limits, "added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Czech defender Ondrej Pavelec took part in Winnipeg's 30th attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 games lost.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays to East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a penchant for the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist bloc (also for Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually for example to Poland or the Soviet Union he needed an invitation letter otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West however you had to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not won yet.
The currency deal that was the condition for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency, however, was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989, the Czechs’ travels have undergone a great revolution.
Although up until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their peak,Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million holiday days in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in western neighbouring countries led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for a hotel or boarding house.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at that time to take with you your own food canned, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech krona which allowed our tourists to finally after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage have increased which has caused around 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel, travel agencies have started since 1997 to prepare tours with connections by air charters that through contracts have greatly reduced the costs compared to what there was before.
At the end of the 1990s the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most of the developed countries around the world apart from the U.S. which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the US abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully rank in the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time again in history they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for holidays abroad including ancillary charges.
The General Assembly must find its President but this risks ending in a situation with no solution "a pat"
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek to the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic will not be known after a General Assembly that is due to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting rules should be followed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football go backwards towards differences between the chambers of the Association that could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16 when a new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and there was not even a question of how to elect.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or even the officials with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the help also of the Bureau for the state and the law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences still persist over the election by-law.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the key point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The apple of discord lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, the candidate who receives the most votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate wins in the third round.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to be withdrawn so that the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the vote percentages.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda who understands the objections of the Moravian side and according to which it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even if he believes that the election rules established according to the statutes benefit the most Pelta among all the candidates.
"I want to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet some sacrilegious ideas imagined by a representative like during past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"Today's possible qualification in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more energy for cooperation," adds the officer of Jablonec who among the three has the greatest experience in the management of football both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
“This is not a problem between Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the draft regulations.”
"This may cause a blockage in the General Assembly again."
“I hope healthy reason wins,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the entire football direction will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorica by Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, among others, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the executive committee to the retaliatory grounds.
At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parts within the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he does not see any correct candidate.
If the head of Plzen footballers Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be put in campaign for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to enter competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from gaining access to the head of the AFRT which a priori would be given favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that should he win the election, he would hold the position of President only until 2013, the year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but who is not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some of them told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
“I would like to change that image,” he added.
What is said to be especially troubling to Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta holds this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, it would be even less favorable for football," Paclik said.
What shocks him again is the fact that Pelta's name was uttered a few years ago during wiretaps as part of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta got away with no trouble.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club".
In the event Paclik wins Thursday’s vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who was supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with."
"He has great capabilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as the head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I'm not putting my nose into what I don't know," said Paclik, who in September drew much attention when he voted for the cancellation of the Referees' Committee with Ludek Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to run private firms and that he has also been running the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated its triumph in the first division with his support last May.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it.”
"I would curb the influence of certain interested groups that for example tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not seek his dislike for Sparta chief Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider a harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level politicians would allow to obtain for sport more money from the tax on games.
"This is one of the key points that the new president should take care of."
“If it’s the gambling tax as the political parties declare it, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"That's not ideal."
I don’t see any reason to pass on my Plzen club shares to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should end pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future the quarrels about the rules for the elections.
The official of Jablonec is before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that the success today of the football representation should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the unsuccessful September election promised to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial means if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this delay of two months may well allow him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and to present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for Thursday to have a president."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily linked to the Jablonec club, has worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
“Unfortunately at the June General Assembly statutes were approved which were not as perfect as everyone noticed.”
"If there weren't all these different interpretations, we would have had a president since September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that caught the full attention of the delegates.
“If I become president, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities in case it doesn’t work.”
“This is a principle without which we cannot exist,” Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with respect to his legal training and that he knows well that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time either, who on the contrary keeps criticizing Pelta.
"He's been playing football for a year and has already had some success."
“His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign.”
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta told his opponent but remained faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon, according to him, is his knowledge of football from the lowest level of competition to national representation.
It should be a football window.
"And I would also endeavor to finish all the affairs that begin with that of the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sectors so that we can get enough money for all football," the 46th candidate told Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring any change in people.
“I should get to know all the employees,” he told Strahov where there is understandable nervousness since there is no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there is a single point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it.”
“Football needs credibility and it will only get credibility when there is a new leader at the helm,” Pelta said optimistically two days before the likely day that will determine his official career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday it would not please many people, it seems.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected, hard work will begin.
He wants systemic changes and making the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I want to take care of football in its entirety.
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and youth football performance."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the competencies within the Executive Committee so that each of the members deals with a specific field."
"And I will distribute difficult missions for football to take a big step forward."
"A lot of people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said he would not run for office because of a critical atmosphere.
“About me, you know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubt on each of my actions," he said.
“A lot of people have told me that I shouldn’t give up because they would give up too.”
“It’s a trust that I can’t betray,” he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"These last two years there has been a lot of de facto work and I don't want to let it go."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation in the Union would return to the way it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
"Behind him are people who would play football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but certainly not for being able to stand anybody."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen.
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do my utmost for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division be divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would end up in the first division."
“There would be no situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech House, which has elected me as its Vice President and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl, who plans to save tens of millions of kroner on disadvantageous contracts, contract negotiations with televisions and on the gaming law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose its credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
“No one can doubt in Plzen that he did a great job this year.”
“If he were elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and not make any notable change among the people in the Commissions.”
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who assessed his rivals.

UFO-optical paddling pools, beautiful Budapest swimming pools: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after turning around the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in soda baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the past 18 months, there’s one item she shouldn’t miss in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she watched the artistically arranged domes, and was swimming against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and admiring the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleased her, she noted in her notebook without delay all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and on the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath". The municipal indoor pools of München, the historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She has led her "trips to the most exceptional baths of Central Europe" in 13 countries, alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
Meder explains that she does not have much interest in the sport but he feels drawn to the water in a totally different way.
It’s irritating that swimmers have to be content to contemplate blue tiles and accommodate the stench of bleach while joggers breathe bewitching scent from spruce forests or can listen to the cheerful bird chirping from the park.
"I wondered one day why pools should actually always be so ugly," the Viennese said.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water double reinforces the architecture
A dip in a pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more effort, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor you have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is transparent on one side, but reflects the beauty of the whole building on the other."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, trampolines.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to take a leap into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Alongside the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of spas whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Terbery form in a bottle Jámálfür).
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views.While from a rooftop of the Zürich bath you can have the whole city in view, you can admire the snow-capped Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal rise towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of bleach does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a sulphur smell, from the <0xC3><0x81>rpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded ground.
The bath designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 was in the meantime closed.
Looking out the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the blossoming of weeds between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: The Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out since its conception in 1844 but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of pool expert, Iris Meder – and not just because she is originally from Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a great performance to fuse such different building styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its commodity speculation?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg - City
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demanded that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation into the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that global commodity stock market speculation is pushing prices upwards and that banks share a complicity in global famine.
The consumer protection campaign concretely aligns against the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Commodity speculation was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts meanwhile share the view that bettors have detached themselves from offers and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently from US competitors: he promised to investigate the complaints and said, "no case is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report charges.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank board of directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way, how much today's banks harm the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly obligated today.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the group’s CEO wants to present a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank has announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything that is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculation.
And about eventual losses, he hardly has to worry about it - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate investments in commodities.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organization.
Bode published the survey Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Just eleven percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many customers of the bank would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their entourage, 49 percent responded that they would consider terminating their account to change bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruins.
Now it is open again and serves as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, glass sheds, bold and bold looks and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the famous world exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its lightweight, suspended steel and glass construction.
Construction is considered to this day as an important milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian Universal Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the Universal Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the South Railway Station in Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suited for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However it was also used for a long time, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly decaying.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a lucky shot in every respect.
The new start was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she particularly carried out the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookstore are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of its move to Vienna and by its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "a gulf of energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was placed and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridge beams have been reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a light panel sifted between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - this is almost a new construction, but still the lightweight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in a red-brown rust protection shade.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also pleases the monuments protection office," says Krischanitz and draws attention to a rough basement floor.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City" story.
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the newly planned "quartier of the central station", with offices and apartments.
And maybe another lucky blow will happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in the millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend an additional 70 million in this regard this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported previously invoking a crisis plan internal to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway installations and docks is expected to double and increase to 16,000 people.
The goal is to clear the docks of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, station manager Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because, among other things, it lacks reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
As a result, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had plenty to do for years, as it has to have ICE train axles checked much more often in the workshop, after an axle break occurred on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is news in the US: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this giant of the sector catches up further in the USA: the Frankfurt institute pays in comparison $145 million (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA financial market regulator has made a series of accusations against the big banks that they have induced the cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost enormous value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down.
"We are pleased that we were able to find a solution to this issue without the parties taking the matter to court," said a spokesperson for Deutsche Bank in New York.
In comparison, the Bank did not acknowledge any faults.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed concessions from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair billions of dollars of damages incurred.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks apart and in the summer it sued JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As far as the issue of mortgage documents is concerned, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit unions are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events date back a few years, at the moment there is a storm wind blowing on American banks.
Investors and supervisors have filed numerous appeals to seek redress or to sanction defaults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, the two US state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for taking advantage in kind in mortgage deals worth about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also due to file an appeal with the FHFA, involving several transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter respond for "substantial losses" but nevertheless without citing a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett raises $10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests colossal sums in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT companies, given that the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad predictions.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his mind about investments in this sector.
It must have been understood much earlier that IBM mainly offers IT services and systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight’s attack on the world of finance.
As a result, the IBM IT business is entitled to call itself "Mr. IBM".
Because Buffett revealed today to the economic program CNBC, that he has bought since March IBM shares worth $ 10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM has never heard of this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been relying for some time on lucrative IT services as an operating accounting center.
The 100-year-old IT pioneer offers both software and consulting as well as high-performance enterprise calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose businesses he understands.
But on the contrary, Buffett is rather attacking rail freight, manufacturers of lubricants or machinery.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding has nearly 80 subsidiaries and shares in a range of major groups such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment IBM shares rose by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue," also known as IBM, has a market value of more than $220 billion and counts Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he does not want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a Greek small business in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background.
Following this news, Turkey as well as the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people the specter that had long been thought dead is reappearing: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable with this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
Whether there is xenophobia in Germany has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology," said the headline of the Turkish daily Haberturk.
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, however, that one of the authors was allegedly a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right mud.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted reasonably: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community of Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony for the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation was staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of drawing from it unambiguous conditions.
"It's starting to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He pointed out that people had been murdered, had paid taxes, and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and these had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it has not already come to the mind of the German authorities much earlier to do research in some suspicious far-right circles, the authors wonder.
More than one is ready at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be sloppy, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defense and armaments."
"It will be the best self-defense."
"Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," Selen writes.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in jeopardy, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the fire in Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance through acts of violence could result.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks which the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be measured by the amount of his tax burdens.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many Germano-Turks is towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Lake Zurich scandal bank
The most adventurous Bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and in the meantime patina from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it became known in July that he would occupy in 2013 a position almost as spectacular: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, praised; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently achieved strength and made kind observations about future colleagues.
"UBS has succeeded in the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London hijacked all of the Bank’s security systems and blew up about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of the UBS board of directors has since been seen as suffering - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the board as early as May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is becoming difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adjustment.
At once he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has once again proved that it has long earned the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, UBS is on one side huge - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been skipping from scandal to scandal for years.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also clever, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS was managing on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
This made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger, who later taught banking for many years in Zurich, says: “I have always taken the UBS as a model of a good bank in front of my students.”
“From the point of view of today, one wonders: how could I have just been so wrong?”
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not going well at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli stepped down surprisingly, who until then was considered a top intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later, we had a glimpse of why he had left.
The bank’s division had flared with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this, it has indeed found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was silenced, to the point that one never even learned its name.
But this was only the first shot.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank had to announce losses again amounting to billions, the chairman of the board Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to house such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“We were not able to save UBS again,” says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster followed the second.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the affluent clientele, which had perhaps defrauded the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS published more or less that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she has lost something that has always been her capital in competition with wealthy clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the Head of the Management Board and the Chairman of the Management Board.
And the exodus of customers' money.
In a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax evasion aid.
And, as there was a bit of a return to calm, and as it was thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed this unfortunate history of securities dealers: a single securities dealer flared 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was not going well.
And it is published: with risk management in investment banking it still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, we have seen that risk management has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
So the chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure of this: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have risk control in hand."
However, this was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long ago assumed their function, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS central in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany's can be found here among the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another sidelined the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, ultimately like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too big, he finds – especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would have further spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say about it.
"And yet they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country of seven million people has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three largest Swiss banks formed a huge group.
A bank was set up, which was already too big for small Switzerland - and has been growing steadily.
What helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with asset management in Zurich as a strong point and a poorer, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who understands very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have relied until the end on Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group always uttered the same slogan: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which documented at that time the success of banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
The corporate advisors, who were responsible for this, however, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS would have shortcomings in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has morphed into a massive machine that packed and passed valuable documents based on US mortgages – but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been trying to get down for a long time.
“Still in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
Jobs at UBS have become ejectable and have so far been bankrupt.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: putting an end to investment banking, concentrating on asset management, returning to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as this is clear so far.
Next Thursday, bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank to its surprise split from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has imposed himself: he must conduct the affairs of UBS sustainably, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress of the mid-1990s.
They are cancelling 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He has so far only publicly said that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week has discouraged American investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
Jugged industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in its seed.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had only half filled last week, not half emptied - but now the problems are pressing once again to the forefront, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The default values of the Dow-Jones-Index showed a loss of around 0.6% at the close of the markets at 12,078 points.

American investors have expressed themselves in a skeptical manner: “We are not an island, but dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: “It is not yet clear if Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was from his point of view too early to invest in bonds coming from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle to the winds and entered the American tech industry.
Its investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supported the share price of this traditional group, and allowed it to score almost more than 1%, against the trend of commercial management.

Smart Crows Spread in Cities
In many places, frogs are considered a "bird problem" but experts say these highly intelligent animals have not been allowed to hunt in cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are multiplying because of the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to drive the freu from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
Protectors of nature based the problems of the cities also on the exodus of particularly protected waters: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional living spaces.
The hunting, development and felling of typical hatching trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 hatching pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project won negative publicity because of the crow slaughter in that region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with sticks particularly brutal.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is of no use," said Werner Klöver, Leer's city and landscape planner.
Destroying nests with pressurized water or cutting down trees often has unintended consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals are moving away, large colonies are dividing up, and they are scattering in other places.”
Eviction is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the eviction of animals to aversive conditioning and catchy offers, in order to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens looked at "info panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better withstand a pimple on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-route-educational baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these highly intelligent freu.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "Here is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: The freus not only use working instruments to arrive at a feast but they manufacture their own tools as working instruments.
University of Cambridge ethologists were testing four frexes recently, to what extent the intelligence of birds arrives.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning crows then had to solve a bigger problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their loot with their beaks.
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four flushes are successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at European Championship 2012
The hopes of a blow by the Bosnians and Turks remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the qualifiers to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and then eliminated Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal went astray against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0 of the match, his fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs made it to the playoff return match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
There was nothing more blazing in the 0:0 draw between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland taking a 1:1 (1:0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-metre penalty played by hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic faced off with a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick 30 meters ahead in the grid.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his shooting skills at a distance and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to forward Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English league of Manchester City initiated a header ball directed towards the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attentions.
After an attack against Helder Postiga during the Bosnia penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other side, Stark granted a controversial hand-played penalty of 11 meters after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion managed four strokes and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team, with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), were also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech with a reflex prevented a last-minute goal by Tomas Sivok potentials (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossbar had to come to the rescue of the world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs already shot down, again, the striker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey was missing the football miracle of Zagreb during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink also had to abandon his place on the bench of the 2002 EM third, the Croatians were able to rejoice in their fourth round in the final of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the post, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to VfL Wolfsburg's Mario Mandzukic, who was replaced by Dortmund's Ivan Perisic in the 62nd minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken over with a 4:0 success the first leg for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for the visitors.
Ireland pushed to the top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Los Angeles Galaxy’s Robbie Keane got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment that the Estonian defense was able to prevent a possible goal from the first scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was on hand and squeezed the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” CEO Bill McDermott announced to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this fast-growing country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase revenues by 2015 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion.
Last year, the Walldorfer posted revenues of nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
Currently the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked so well.
SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our business ...,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information.”
Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book, "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War," opens with a long list of heart-wrenching characters.
A tip to get started: carefully tear this page apart and make it your bookmark.
In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book that he describes, with accuracy, as "an anti-history work."
It has a few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassadors or discussion of strategies and materials are found.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like," including "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
“Beauty and Sorrow” sums up the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance workers, and vendors.
Some of them will become heroes.
Others are prisoners of war, some will lose members, go crazy, or lose their lives.
Their lives falter here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are rekindled.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
He refutes the idea that World War I was summed up only in the terrible trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skilfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is touching from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When gunshots sound in the distance, and you're a mother at home, do you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been compounded by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nanny in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them deal with deprivation and the ability to get away with it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, überall ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He's prosecuting on replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice crushed into sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
It states that "837 authorized substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive for savagery and states about war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish and cloy'y behind no one's civilization is synonymous with it.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is in great danger of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
“When you’re resigned to sacrifice, you hope to have an audience,” he wrote.
This is unfortunately rather comparable to "a convicted man strangled in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“The conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He seizes the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroisms.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression is found in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread over the genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate apply it to their eyes, which results in blindness for life."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures how the war “triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory", or Erich Maria Remarque's "To the West Nothing New", rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have ever read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it was as if he had emerged from his book, grabbed from your hands this page with the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a meticulously planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others who were informed from the outset that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no reruns of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which went against the department’s rules and spawned a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clear Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared by observing the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall, in view of the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better riot-fighting training — anti-terrorism measures that consist of quickly moving large numbers of police officers — to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move around the park came "at the last minute," one regular said, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
"The few police officers I know who were called did not know they were going to Zuccotti Park," the person said on condition of anonymity.
"The only ones who know they're going there are at the top of the hierarchy of the police department."
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that a lot of people would come and go in the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was necessary to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windbreaks, many protesters simply packed up their belongings and left.
No tents were hit before 1:45 a.m., police said, giving the occupants time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said the move was taken solely for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly restrained by the officers.
Browne said the TV camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture footage.
As the police moved west through the protesters’ thick jumble of business, including luggage, plastic turf and bags of sheets filled with clothes, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away and the images were posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp clung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
The emergency services were called to cut off the padlocks.
No arrests were made in the park before 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for "disorder of public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most senior officer to have been on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, though present, "did not lead the operations," Browne said.
A second group of policemen waited along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if intervention was needed.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as Pine Street, to the south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, were reportedly even seen pushing people away.
There were about 28 people on the north side.
One of the liveliest actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, while others were seen puncturing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The school assistants union sues the city for layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month, plans to file a lawsuit in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory redundancies, with a disproportionate impact on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the 37th District Council, in an attempt to have the dismissals cancelled.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees, among the lowest paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7, and union leaders compared the layoffs to political revenge for not allowing the city access to a health care fund run by workers' groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget that closed in June.
One member of the Council responded, noting that the dismissals of school assistants were not specified in the budget.
Officers from the 37th District Council said they would fill out a complaint notice, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuits to the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the City Department of Education will be the defendants, and the plaintiffs will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all black or of Latin American origin, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school aides have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern Bronx neighborhoods.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aides at Harlem’s 36 public school, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the lawsuit states that “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget shortage.”
The budget of the 36 public school was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each underprivileged student registration.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six coordinators of parents have been dismissed", and "not just because of overstepping".
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya issue
Eventually, it would seem that Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement at the Capitol on the issue of the Libyan uprising.
It will have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage."
“This resolution is about honoring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate over Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties clashed, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not approving the U.S. military role in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure to cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission thus remained in a form of legislative purgatory – Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The indecision of Congress has been overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide legislators as it did last June?
Senator and Commission Chair Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of a new project.
In the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far not succeeded in getting their amendments approved, but that is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House alone of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would “control federal spending.”
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters — especially new Republicans who want to gild their resumes — the chance to brag about being the “author” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, many members want to limit the number of terms in which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment banning the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose it.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The rate is slowing compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten," Gabrielle Giffords says in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at close range in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared Monday night on a television show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover above all else rather than return to Congress.
During her appearance on ABC's "20/20", alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show addressed its difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and called her recovery “difficult.”
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, responded “pretty good.”
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20/20," released on the eve of the couple's new book titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a wide scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign from the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What?"
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change her breakfast menu.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours a day with doctors, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information about the six people killed in the incident for the first time.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
“There have been a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't beaten,'" Kelly said.
You just got slaughtered.
And you're gonna get away with it, recover, and come back stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for the homeless veterans of New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in a tie suit stood at his feet to cheer him up.
“The military, men and women, are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, chief of staff of the United States Armed Forces, saw the role of troops differently.
“They were presented as a kind of orphan,” the senior military officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know, I know.
But it wasn't respect, it was pity.
Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have settled between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if they are sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits."
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not wish to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they have faced insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if “an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt a few people passing him interviews subtly asking if he would be able to hold on to the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from the fight.
“When you approach the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions,” Colonel Cancian recalls when speaking to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely commended by a country so unfamiliar with the military and which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as we did in World War II," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people largely focus on the depth of a military man’s sufferings.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost, or the extent of injuries.
The army faces growing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beer.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was an alarm bell," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texans have put aside their concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I'll have to follow my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and some not, will be anxiously awaiting the court’s decision at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether a lawsuit against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of failing to stop the widespread rape in the army, thereby violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Settled in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. That number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the military did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke declares that she is attacking the galloped military, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
She also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will bring several lawsuits, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in or out of service for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
"The alleged wrongdoing is inherent in the complainants' military service," the documents said.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely solely male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s soldiers play an increasingly important role, especially in getting in touch with local women.
As a result, of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat situations.
It's time for the military to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in fighting this fight: three other trials are ongoing in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a group for military women's rights.
His group filed a lawsuit in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to handle claims for benefits for people claiming to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also looks at the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the military were prosecuted - half of the percentage of the civilian justice system.
Complainants in the Susan Burke case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In the Lyman case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the fact.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to different police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her assailant - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge, at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who ended up being acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was handed down,” said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start contracting. I started screaming after the court."
“I was put in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commander, ‘This wasn’t his trial, this was mine.’”
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was fired on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
Will the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs move forward or not, it's a long story," said John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington's Faculty of Law.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction lies between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents posed by responsibility.
“The odds are heavily against them... but it’s important that they try,” he added.
These things only change when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn out to be in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the military on this issue as long as there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a mere guy sharing his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught in a murderous insanity in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from it on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time prior to the attack on his computer, chatting with a few of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is littered with so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific accuracy — the way marketers have done it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. They targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions asked were about their level of education, their attitudes towards their own future violence and their optimism.
By getting in touch with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new must-have tool in the hands of scientists.
Focus groups, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, through Likes, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three pieces of content a day, the “data supernova” is generating a search explosion, increasing the number of search jobs whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you might not approach on the street.
“Before, when you tried to conduct investigations into people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you in,” says Jamie Bartlett.
“Facebook avoids all of this – you have direct access to their information.”
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their drunken exploits were much more likely to be alcoholics than students who were discreet about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle-based Children's Research Institute, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise be unrecognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics regarding the love situation and Valentine's Day, the turnout rate in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its treasure trove of data available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is something else online.
“I don’t think a large number of users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London’s Knowledge Laboratory, based on a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students’ Facebook walls.
"As far as they knew, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” says Neil Selwyn.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and pen remain the best tools one can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
“Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect – and social is not in front of a computer.”
"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance” fighter in his first appearance at the Oslo trial.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Templars of Norway,” he told a 500-person courtroom.
"As far as the court's jurisdiction is concerned, I reject it because you hold your mandate as organizations that support an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty."
Justice Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to be sure he would be put behind bars.
All of them attended the hearing to see the trial end.
“I found it cold and inhuman,” one survivor from Utoya told Norwegian television station NRK.
"I was not comfortable, but I personally advanced a little after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, staring journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and exited the courthouse.
Despite the odd idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not insane. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks thus appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
“I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it’s not,” said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, at the Movies This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some have compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will air this week in the first part of a film on major markets, is how much this creative mind had understood the processes and workflows of products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a flowchart improver - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease that made them think that a great idea did 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work produced an exception to the idea."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years since Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming for a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full-length video was found in the director’s garage.
This video, slightly edited, is the basis of the 68-minute film called Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will air in theaters next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide an accurate answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurfaces, when he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to make him speed up and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, we find a strangely present aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision on the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous reviews of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable Lost Interview sequences:
On how he learned to run a business:
“During all these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers are constantly the same, ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to give details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" evaluated by nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed the accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a trick on the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack phone networks and phone free long-distance.
The device has been the subject of many prior writings, but Steve Jobs’ euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public telephone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We would wrap the ball of different things half a dozen times and you would scream on the pay phone and it would happen to you a minute later on the pay phone next door,” Jobs said.
“We were young and through this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn't know much, but we invented a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by recounting a wonderful trick he and Wozniak devised: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go insanely laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
About his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett’s approach):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looks for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and makes a call to him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode-ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
In several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a whim.
Early in his career, as he settled down to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working with only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished appliances.
Later, at Apple, he recalled the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember some big fights... they were yelling at me that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300] and I had enough, I went out and went to a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and it turned out to be incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are running out of steam:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
“Suppose you worked at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then what?”
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more success.
Sales and marketing can evolve it, so [it’s these types of people] who end up leading companies and product staff are sidelined from decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this position of monopoly is completely rotten by people who can’t imagine designing a good product versus a bad product – the manual labor required.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They snatched defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to be made...Some things you can’t do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, the factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It's about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring those things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We are always ashamed of stealing great ideas.
This is partly what makes the Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health law opponents as the court meets
The day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to consider the issue of political discord, whether President Obama’s opposition to the health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were spotted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases involved a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 am is expected next March, and the result will probably be such as to favor the destabilization of the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full swing by the time the court decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law, will likely be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen law firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health law.
The star guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would doubtless argue by the code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fundraising by law and other organizations even though the judge may not be an intervener, an honorary guest, or listed on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the Code contradicts several judges' statements that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"Judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dismantles any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics claiming that they mix court affairs too easily with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general solicitor to the Obama administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the court of first instance.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would do so.
Boeing records record order of $18 billion for airliners
Emirates orders 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 airliners, with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order containing 50 of its products.
It is, on the other hand, quite a deal when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of $ 18 billion.
Equally amazing is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing reported the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle.
The Dubai-based airline Emirates placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, bringing the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8s, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and passenger convenience.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than one billion dollars.
“This is clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular are of immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So not only do they have the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their biggest expense - would not be so detrimental to them since the country would earn money from the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point as these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders as the price of oil rises, Dihora said.
“They have natural risk coverage,” he said.
Emirates’ order strengthens Boeing’s dominance in the wide-body market and helps curb Airbus’ attempt to encroach on its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the larger version of the A350, which directly competes with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its beginnings to increase its thrust following the demand of its customers to increase its load capacity and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Obviously Beaten in Michoacán Election
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the run for governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her attempt to gain access to the office of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
Initial results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for the post of governor of that western state.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country,” Luisa Maria Calderon told the radio during an interview on Monday following the election.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... They seized the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he is organizing his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only slightly from Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the position of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence persisted.
A week before the election, a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates locally renounced the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, however corrupt the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging ahead of next year."
BASD strongly urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term downturn that would impede the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Managing Director of the Manila-based BASD, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic powers must “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe’s difficulties with an “indifferent eye” and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe’s leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all in this crisis together.”
“Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them."
In recent months, the eurozone has been severely shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has skyrocketed and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The burgeoning sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fears that the global economy will fall back into recession, and has prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag foresaw that the IMF would channel any Asian assistance, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the U.S. financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's trade and industry minister, said "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from lower exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the euro zone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the wealthy Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get Europe to accept aid for the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
"One day they will find that the Greeks are retiring at age 50 and going on vacation in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the eurozone crisis was likely to have "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD's forecast for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop “rescue plans” to protect themselves from an economic turnaround and significant capital flight.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields, including civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 or more in cuts is imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, applied indiscriminately, would render most of our ships and construction projects unexecutable – you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a ship – and seriously undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote.
"We would also be forced to part with a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal."
“These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our readiness.”
The cuts would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
“Although wartime financing of foreign contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruption in core budgets,” Panetta warned.
“Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and oversight of contracts that support the war.”
“Wage management staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a sequestration of the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the publication of Panetta's letter.
“It’s not a consequence we can live with, and it’s certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about the possible cuts, even though he himself has reached the top post in the Pentagon cumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the secretary of defense painted a dark picture of what might happen — a military man with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter jet, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to face potential opponents."
"Indeed, it invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could “generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the cutting edge, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship, and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Spot a Lie
A look at recent headlines indicates just how ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, has passed for an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of those who lived through the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton sparked by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at the school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers gave test responses to students in order to be seen on their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie to each other three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to exclaim, "I had you," deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research into such projects, notably in psychology and physiology.
One of the findings of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They do not stutter, blush or always stir.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A skilled lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial microexpressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific findings in the vast and still emerging body of knowledge about deception, and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are skilled at reading others well, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more lies “centered on themselves” while women tell more lies “centered on others” – usually to protect someone’s feelings – that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "setting the benchmark data".
This helps provide a reference point to measure future changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves their feet permanently so as not to make unfair accusations when you see them moving their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for signs of verbal and non-verbal misleading behavior.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, lean toward an exit, change posture significantly, or present “post-interview” relief – an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change in posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
Famous Scott Peterson slipped using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals may also use distant language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... if I remember correctly... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan to be confounded after threat of late U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico — angering unions while appeasing environmentalists — the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebraska Dunes, and is confident the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department’s announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska Dunes and Ogallala Aquifer, vast groundwater sources.
“It’s a real way forward,” Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy's involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, he would have to go through six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan are pushing for a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only pose limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department’s inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, centered on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit in fear
A New York family says Disco diva Patti LaBelle, who was thrown into a rampage of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan apartment building, terrified their little girl to the point where she threw up in fear.
“Lady Marmalade’s tirade scared 18-month-old Geneviève Monk to the point that she suffered “personality changes, sleep disorders” and “increased fear of strangers,” her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was on his way to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk descended into the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and laid down her daughter for a while.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to get her," she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
“She said to me in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’” says Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘What you say or think doesn’t interest me.’
She got mad and started using swearing -- the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you have done to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who was still holding Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held back by her entourage who drove her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls for comment.
The lawsuit claims unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a children’s cancer charity.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.”
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's management, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in return there is a deterioration of the main development indicators.
The low temperatures in February, apart from causing trillion-dollar losses for the agricultural sector, limited the state's economic opportunities for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historical decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the frost allocation report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage to 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the rest 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, up to November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the rate of unemployment of the state during the first three quarters of the year has been observed an accelerated increase, because while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent for the second quarter of the year and 5 per cent for the second quarter.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
“What we’re seeing is a rise in unemployment that’s due to a variety of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a resource constraint by legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who make dollars illegally it’s not easy for them to work for them, to invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because on entering they already have a lot of difficulties to find work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market worsens considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the lag for the state are the low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the FDI of the State reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the previous year of the same period.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government requested in July at the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, destined for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State congress was no 2.600 trillion pesos.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employers’ sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés’ government demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work intensively to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we must double our effort, we had to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year have constrained the state's economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, among which the frosts, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining the Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana de Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state towards productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and the economic direction of the state, because it is important that we detonate the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he says.
Lots to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in how public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marijuana
A resident of Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic informed that the convicted small trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of possession of marihuana for sale.
According to the file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was riding in a white pickup truck, in which he was carrying a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and in the co-pilot's place a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convict is still in the Crime Consequences Enforcement Centre.
Debts towards contributions to works
Works of a social nature included in programmes such as Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes may not be finished where there are serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the construction programmes have progressed so far, they are in a risky situation because the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a part," he says, "and we, in order not to record delays, we started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided at that time.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid for," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the state authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end, they haven’t given us anything.”
The Court validates the "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and House of Representatives have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called “analog cut” from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concretize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, due to the fact that the regulation of radio and television is an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In favor of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions foreseen by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers resolved to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the presiding minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the bill, in that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also do not consider that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has the constitutional mandate of the state leadership.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the change, he argued, would be postponing the benefits of digitization that involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that many countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded in a form the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislative, he assured.
The possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán is being analyzed
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 to 6 thousand to 74 trials.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local norms with federal electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán did not homologate either its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral process to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for by the Journal of Electoral Justice.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the state proxy’s vote for constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal” because he has no right to “sanction or challenge” them.
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out the partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of the ballot and counting in the ballot file is not with the president of the ballot; or there are errors or obvious alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all polls of the election may be counted when there is an indication that the difference between the supposed winner of the respective election and the one who obtained second place in the poll is equal to or below one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition.
The total count of the ballot can also be made if at the end of the common count it turns out that the difference between the supposed winner and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate came out second, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of the partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16%, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday towards night, and on Monday people will pay their respects and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the last wish of the lieutenant-colonel was that his ashes be spread in the sierra of Zapalinamé.
After receiving the tributes alongside the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest ones attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel arrived at the vigil chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former tech baccalaureate colleagues and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was a member when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
“He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always said this to his family and friends,” said the pilot’s sister, Sandra Bacio Cortés.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and cared much for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo at a very young age to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it, because they said he even had truck pain; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion on which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopan for the graduation of his relative, for this he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His Last Farewell
With honors it was said goodbye to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, tribute that was led by Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, where he studied both in 1985 and in 1985, directors and students of the Technological Institute.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of this service.
The remains of the Saltillo-born pilot Bacio Cortés arrived (incinerated) at 6:05 p.m. to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's esplanade, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other students, and his parents.
Three abandoned bodies found on Cadereyta property NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authorities had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered by gunfire in different parts of the body and with the coup de grâce, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige and coffee color the portal was widely open.
Looking inside, approximately three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with shoulder straps.
A metre away was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another location, as no shell shells were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one organized crime group to the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence made the presentation of 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to have a relationship with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to published information, in a first act on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of her liberty was rescued.
They were confiscated three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed that they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel made a surveillance tour in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long gun, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 2 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested at La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy's president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to overcome this difficult phase,” he told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The “framework is now well laid out,” he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in less time than normal, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Highlighting pressure on Monti to hurry, volatile markets put the yield on Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could result in a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began Monday his consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations.
He will finish his tour of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 so-called footballers from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 participants participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by the two countries for today's friendly, at 15:05 hours, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly ranking, count an extensive record of inter-selection A-class games, the Tricolore only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful Premier League clubs in England, maintain an intense year-round activity in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated qualifiers of the European Cup and the World Cup of football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have international experience limited to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish national team is that of goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, brain flyer of Barcelona, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the forward of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol is a 100-year-old with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left-hand side Junior Díaz, with 48 appearances and the goal scorer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five passed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't even 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not starting yet.
Spain's historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the record holder with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to give one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to perform in this country.
It is that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The band is in the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and Sunday the 20th will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 19:30 hours, next to the Los Angeles group The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to spend a few days there.
We are excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity in the days before.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve given over the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We gave two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned it, through the people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you had offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is the cause of this?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that’s why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to perform each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t performed in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
“First of all, I don’t think any of us ever imagined that we were going to form a great rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to recount our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together thrills us a lot.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
This is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to still be friends with all of them and it’s an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that has emerged.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and that alone is much longer than many bands normally last.
Firstly, I believe we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we all care about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to everyone to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t get any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity hasn’t been easy; however, thanks to your success, you’ve been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew older, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don’t spend too much time touring because it’s easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what it has brought, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn’t really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn’t release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration about the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh a lot, it was always a pleasure to work with him and music.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
National group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this was the band we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He's the one who sings it, and I think he does it with the first words he can imagine.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge relevant despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the bands that came up at the same time and, if that’s relevant now, I think it’s wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting, because I think there are songs on the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that qualify as very obscure songs, even though these may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think you can be happy and even make dark music like that.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for loss of muscle strength he has in his pussies, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including tongue cancer for which he has been operated on four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt he said that the latter does so because he feels innocent.
He has been operated on four times for tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people due to an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community the countries that continue to be tax havens, a declaration that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of his ambassador of this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, since November, and has an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the implementation of tax exchange agreements to leave the "gri list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, since 2004, Mexico and Uruguay have entered into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the trade of goods between the two nations.
The mustache plumber moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, was designed from the beginning to take full advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile system, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” Nintendo Spain’s specialised press officer Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez said during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", because hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a fast and smooth gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more experienced will be able to make a "second turn" to the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also supposes the return of the character to a mobile console, something that did not happen since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustache plumber must travel through platforms mined with danger to free Princess Peach.
Even if I player finds novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to answer to the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus the trial ends so that Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge it.
In a press conference, Colom said his decision obeys the independence of the judiciary and executive power taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure he "had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given effect to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done presupposes an executive step after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional proceedings to try the former mandatary of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzlement of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
To this is added the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people with little training, without work, with drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and current eco-socialist municipal councillor Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the General Charity Director of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended in the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is too, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-partys, evacuated
The invaders had seized 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51.
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of number 51 of Rue Balmes were living has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned yesterday at noon the building they were illegally occupying and where they were organizing micro-partys that desperately neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From this day on, there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of the water installation, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass celebrations, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business fell by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub mentioned that the invaders of the property made her unfair competence, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreational space had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, while, according to her, the trouble was not caused by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The head of the nightclub explained that the problems were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months that he "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common life and civics that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in property".
Yesterday also, the Mossos (Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the advisability of convening beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all the access doors to Collserola.
A door brings to the idea of park, without a doubt.
That's it, or someone else wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this former caste of elect speak to when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on the "mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of green blocks has not been completed.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "as accesses to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
The dangers stem from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience of the 80's and which had in the Forum area "swan song".
The first fear is the delimitation of the boundaries on which we can build.
“Limiting something means already establishing the next step,” that is, its overcoming.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause real disasters."
By sticking more to the question, Modol opines that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not".
Modol recalls that there is already work done by the Collserola Board of Trustees that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the city council offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he hears that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe passage that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he says) that we have had to create: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the basics of the contest there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-sectional contests - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he has opted to participate in the 16 contests.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors could clash in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In his opinion, yes, the town hall should guarantee that the band immediately higher than that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the groundsman of the Red Casino granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 years in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the legal power of Casino Red grants him pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás demanded that he pay an economic fee for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of Mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor 3 of Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the capital of the State.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second arrest warrant was issued after the Public Prosecutor dismissed the corruption and organized crime offences.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal center allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with 1.5 million pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial held in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing its operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the prosecutor attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who of the partners of the gambling house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to file 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted a legal pardon and subsequently no claim can be made in relation to the lawsuit against him; he will not be asked for compensation for damages or punishment.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to communicate to Jonás that he had been legally pardoned and his file would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives indicate that the helicopter crashed directly into the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"Evidence that the unit has had various contacts with the ground, the blades have had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit has lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements for transporting personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the impact zone do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In research it has been reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact presented itself in a structural way.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For now, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was operating at cruise speed and this happened on soft ascending ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, TBS holder Pérez Jácome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was performed according to the visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-lying cloud layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew sought a lower altitude area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last radar recording of the aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The aircraft debris dispersion model suggests that the helicopter collided with the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
In the place of the loss there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above average sea level, with a gradient of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticulated himself along his journey.
The information provides evidence that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a larger area than the encircled area around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, supporting the presumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and youth; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the "Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents" protocol that will have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the population with or without entitlement to participate, to present themselves at the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the proofs to the minors are carried out every Saturday from 8:00 hours.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 miners, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires related to diet.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family heredity history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetic (people associated with childhood obesity are being identified) will be applied to all participants on Saturdays.
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there has been a 77 percent increase in obesity for boys and 47 percent for girls; there has also been a dramatic increase in overweight," he said.
He said the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population is different from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American, 30 percent European and five percent African heredity and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy one consumes (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they are overweight or obese.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is handled in a confidential way, doctors give it in writing to parents, who are explained each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryness, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - cornmeal batter wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200,000 blackcurrants each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the tar pavement is completely eliminated, even blackcurrants could be reduced.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Blackcurrants, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and therefore, the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The CF researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass by generating stress, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, the chemical engineer said.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, a last layer called a rolling layer is put, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer and it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and consequently causes blackheads.
In the process of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that spoils is the rolling film and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be cured at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrant and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrant.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to research and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it possible to repair blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her 14th title of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico has climbed with the crown and the sceptre, the department has already won 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), María Blas (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Al Patricia Garala Gilini (1949).
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Police Queen and Best Beautiful Face of Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who crowned Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe that it is a way of culturalizing, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it is a pretty deep book.
Now I am reading Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a very beautiful book that is called The Ardor of Blood.
This answer did not please firstly because of the term "culturalize" and secondly because it did not explain concretely how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses put forward is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota hinted that being the favorite, the cheerleader and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (gastronomy challenge Oster, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't go on stage".
And this was noted in her first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and her two coronation eve parades.
Although she seemed confident at both parades, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on RCN Channel's "Como en casa" program, said that the fact that Melina was named princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets the most prizes during the contest does not receive the queen's crown."
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That’s why two days before the election, international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to her country’s social needs.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his defects of his butt and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The queen trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the candidate of Valle were the surgeries that she had undergone.
“The surgeries are good, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect.”
For this award, which the National Beauty Contest presents for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came a cruel prediction that was fulfilled last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo gave to Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So was the work of the person from Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A typewriter from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a typewriter of the Cali CTI went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability" of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies that had to be identified were located.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in typoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take with him clothes for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who ran the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But the fingerprints aren't lying.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a sampler and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typewriter from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can be crucial in resolving crimes.
Apart from identifying the bodies, typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identities of those captured.
When captured, many offenders present fake ID cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to take a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint with the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different robberies," he recalls.
Fingerprints can also dismiss or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man, with drink bottles around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative may be a suspect in the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it puts him on the scene.
A CTI typewriter explained that "fingerprints are extracted from objects with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a picker or strip is used to pick them up.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of declinants, or to the National Civil Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that everything is not as shown in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything that is touched does not necessarily become a footprint.
It can, however, be used, if the necessary confrontation is carried out.
'Indignated' defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were hurling themselves in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged authorities in New York on Tuesday by trying to re-enter Manhattan’s place with a court order, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were jostling outside Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a judicial order that allows the "outraged" to camp in this place again, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square again, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the "outraged" response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the indignants occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by the parish Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the Police moved there and arrested some protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe of the fact that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene on their behalf before the Police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned enclosure - remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
Some demonstrators who had been displaced at that time carried and distributed copies of the court order and even handed it over to the officers who were guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes", Bray said, denouncing the fact that some officials hit the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with tents or other properties they used previously.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but warned them that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters 'violated the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the square because it became “a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people”, because “some shops had received threats” and residents were afraid “for their quality of life”.
"The evacuation this morning at dawn was disgusting and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than American workers," the movement's spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
"Occupy Wall Street" officials also said they did not plan to hold "major actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, it will be released on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen’s assistant in “Home Improvement,” first responder in “Baywatch,” rabbit in “Playboy,” wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage from the television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary while holding a doll in a manger that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently starred in a part of Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth,” appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Noel also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan revived after the earthquake
GDP rises 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still recovering after the devastating earthquake that became the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Government of Tokyo estimated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page definitively: the GDP rose by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - is also the fastest pace of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by higher spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the turmoil forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floatline is determined by the health of major technology groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, blamed the yen for their weak performance between July and September.
While markets continue to be headquartered in peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government remains on guard.
"We must follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the majority of member countries showed clearer signs of an economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that the main powers are being restrained.
Because it has dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been below the average, which is in the 100 level, n dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but Conservatives won't sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to get entangled in the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days established in his designation will perhaps be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures of February 19 for the restraint of the elections in any case.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of October 26," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, the reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader has gone one step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the bodies that must unlock the $8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and has made clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika's inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses the "preponderant" place of Spain with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in that which has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people who live with low incomes, it is the goal of reducing to half the volume of people who live with low incomes.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for the main beneficiaries of these loans",
We have “achieved a lot of goals” and “we face a lot of challenges.”
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families come out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sofia stressed as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work of which she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him the qualification of "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid yesterday from the "banking of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in finding solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she argued that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits suppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of the developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of the reductions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the "excluded people to whom everyone closes the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European president by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic party.
The future of Europe was not initially foreseen on the agenda but prevailed in the fall, especially to satisfy the activists who judge the government's policy too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, at the end of their speeches, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhile finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The idea behind the Chancellor - and the motion - lies in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could translate into amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the fiscal policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is in any case one of the motion proposals adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Admittedly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight each country’s weight on the European Central Bank’s board according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted to reinforcing Germany’s weight.
Anxious to appease the climate within her party, the chancellor multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and to Helmut Kohl But she did not seek to win her congress on the backs of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the hollow.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in sick leave?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and welfare.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigor, but is no less herald of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
First of all with a view to saving budgets: the government plans to impose on private employees a fourth day of deficiency before taking charge of a work stoppage.
In other words, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could arouse anger, but would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of non-compensated absence in case of work stoppage (they have no waiting period so far, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also relaunching the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will reimburse," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday.
As in other cases, the advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
Since 2002, it has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives, which have most often paid off.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditures in 2008, at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% concerned sick leave, or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That’s 2.5 percent of health care spending.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days of work stoppage, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any sick days.
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance , specifies that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was of a duration of less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone to work stoppages than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) fluctuated in France between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud represents very little compared to working in the dark.
As for fraud, it reaches only a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 carried out for short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11% of cases "inadequate or unjustified" out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little compared, for example, to that of black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros in tax losses per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to recover its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said Monday in front of Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment programme," said the head of government, who made his first public speech at the opening of the confidence vote debate in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, because the country's participation in the eurozone "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, on Monday supported measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt, and fighting waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to Royal Society of Canada report
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to deliver better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of a large report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts in a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, this rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that run counter to the federal government's position, which has already said it does not want to change the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, said by teleconference yesterday, there would be more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Downie said.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Eighty-five percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would allow end-of-life people to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are of less value.
As for those who practiced assisted suicide, 41 percent said they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the report’s authors say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect a denial of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to deliver better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with respect to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee calls for it to be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and for it to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some health law experts have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts signatories of the report "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Ms. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
"In society," he said, "there are beacons and constraints."
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, specifically challenges the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, namely the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Leave Power
Damascus denounces "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday outside the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria of Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after Syria was suspended by the Arab League, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, took a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bashar was concerned about his country's interests, he should resign, but he should also create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had failed.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces have died in the southern Syrian region of Deraa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed "during exchanges of fire and shelling with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the country was "stepping towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not bend,” he added, assuring that “the plots plotted against Syria will fail.”
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now considering a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also said he is in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he says is locked into "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on November 2, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities plagued by the protests and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Arab League's decision was "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, while being wary of supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded some time from the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in talks with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important program with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the designated council president.
The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a narrow list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for preparing a government and its program, he stressed, saying he was "certain that markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment by the president had initially been hailed by the markets, but worries picked up especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti pledged, once he took office, to work urgently and with the aim that Italy "become the protagonist again" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: "Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its fiscal balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigorous measures.
The "patron of the bosses" of Italy Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit parameters".
Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, because Italy has to place by April 2012 for 200 billion euros of state bonds.
Russian Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. nuclear risk NGO said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents emanating from this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA said last week it was "seriously concerned" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, reportedly worked for three decades starting in the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk, Urals, and was involved in manufacturing synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then reportedly cooperated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA cites "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but who, as one member state informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within his country's nuclear military program."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Offences Increased by 50%
Crimes and offences against Muslims rose by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence fell slightly or made little progress, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, representing a 49 per cent increase, compared with a 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of “hate crimes” rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by race differences and 20% by religion differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offenses increase again,” Human Rights First said, adding that “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, the group’s chief executive.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he said, adding that this could require improved police reporting of “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of civil rights struggle.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual belonging.
Twitter is changing its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" allow you to follow more legibly, live the activity of other "Twittos", the users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they are following messages, if they are subscribing to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its non-instinctive, somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast someone else’s message, <0x23>followfriday to recommend following another user) making insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were debating in sharp tweets about the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, intrusive, and it looks too much like Facebook," <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed," <0x40>dannykronstrom wrote.
Austrian
Inclusion of a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution
The ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democrat coalition government in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a fiscal "golden rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
The decision was announced by the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann at the end of a cabinet meeting, when Austria's public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were lowered by just one notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an extra three billion euros in interest each year,” said Christian Democrat Deputy Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is following a request from the summit in Brussels of the member countries of the euro area on October 26: the heads of state and government had then demanded the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease each year by 0.75% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring the public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Yen fort
Noda threatens further intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record for strength since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has steadily risen since then, boosted by purchases by investors who consider it a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar rose below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen mark, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge of the Japanese currency hurts the exports of the archipelago because it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda said, fearing that the rise in the yen would kill the fragile recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy returned to growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption.
But the prime minister said the price of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5 trillion yen (47 billion euros), raising to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to the purchases of various financial securities to flood the market with liquidity.
Euro area:
Rate rises, stocks fall
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to undermine European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro zone, the European stock exchanges are sinking a little further into negative territory, this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt sold 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With new strains on the yields of eurozone states in difficulty, equity markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, in turn suffering renewed fears from market players about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes set on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro zone penalizes the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it declined after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, met in congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 would be the "principal task" of his government.
Spain is in the crosshairs of the markets as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The rate spread between Germany and Spain’s 10-year bonds has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
INSEE, however, revised down the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1% decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, it is truly the fourth that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy for an election to be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear power in them.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources to continue producing electricity permanently, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which just intends to build only the latest generation of power plants.
Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its park by resuming the construction of a plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a jump in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all of these unpleasant effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be considered.
European champion of wind power, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; according to which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not manifest a principled opposition to this energy, the polls show.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has helped to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it drives a galaxy of specialized SMEs on international markets and makes them very creative of non-relocationable jobs.
If France decides to quit nuclear power, it would be sacrificing many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros of annual French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years when its manufacturer’s decline would be scheduled?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miraculous electricity production, nor is there any diabolical one.
Areva’s development of low-CO2 solutions, both nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions, with no human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it able to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, the stopping of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift given to Areva and EDF competitors, leaving them the way to seize leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of numbers, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made the news, with the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic perspective.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left as well as on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our “migration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps electorally paying; but it is very costly economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among scholars on the positive impact of country migration flows on employment and wage growth.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and detrimental to employment.
The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are likely to replace domestic workers, especially the low-skilled, by putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, practicing mainly trades in sectors with a shortage of jobs.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will struggle to work in a country with a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on nationals' wages and employment.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages over the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, in Germany, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to the public budgets on average over the course of his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to go and find the missing growth points "with his teeth".
The teeth in question, by serving to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, European democracy is still to be thought of
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be enough for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis of the Europe we are living in is an economic crisis, but it is also, and above all, a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have had in this regard the value of a double revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of the political, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to the needs and in a dispersed order.
A white seat to the absolute European monarch or a jump on foot together in the vacuum of nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cutters but an exercise, common, of full right, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - one would no longer know where to stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that is succumbing to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
Europe as a whole is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the steering of the European project.
Because together, Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After a long fight against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for a European economic government.
Oh, yeah.
But to think without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in the construction of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic Europe, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
"Contactless" smart cards are becoming widespread
The world smart card fair opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most popular segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or pay for purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent almost 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double bites.
This year, Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards.
To move to the next level, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions are committed to systematically distributing contactless credit cards to their customers in the future," said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential to carry out transactions.
"They're late."
“But they should finally see a real boom next year.”
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Societe Generale, too, said yesterday to prepare the market launch of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is spreading
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-suspected links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's deputy foreign minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algeria has now "gained certainty".
“The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation,” he said.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French men in Niger last January has reportedly uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerien investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of past calls directs to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its modus operandi, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or increasingly complex explosive devices and the same bill as those used by AQMI.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminati of little interest.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram – which in Hausa means “Western education is a sin” – advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for sharia law while its militants engage in the struggle against the ungodly central government.
The latter are aimed primarily at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, multiplying attacks on police stations.
The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invades the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, detained alive, is killed in prison.
From then on the sect will radicalize and leave its northern strongholds.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the secure police headquarters in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia via Nigeria is now a concern for all security experts.
While Aqmi has invaded Mali and Niger, and al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all intelligence".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying thunderous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strongpoint.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans – often unsubstantiated – fume.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the nomination of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and to challenge them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme that bears in an America exasperated by the migration of whole swathes of its industry to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if it involves a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that “flatters” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he boasted.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop a nuclear capability” – apparently ignorant of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, said he was ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine when it came to counterterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of its na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" of Iraq, on its misrepresentations in Libya, thus sticking a label of weakness to it.
But the attack is not so easy.
The public considers Obama’s national security record, which eliminated bin Laden, to be rather positive.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to stagnation.
And, arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more fairly.
The Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, linking Western Europe directly to Russia via the Baltic Sea floor, has entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the banks of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and fine buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe via a first tube of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is due to be completed by the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same path.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction site looks like a victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream will make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossing through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a rift between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are declining.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically,” François Fillon confirmed when inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating how big gas contracts are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-coated steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“Around 100 had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply the measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project leaders gave it up as the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state-owned company settle permanently off their coasts.
"In the event of a breakdown, we stop the gas flow in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have predicted the welds to have a leak every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the state of the pipeline is provided by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, he delivers accurate information about possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at departure, and 100 bars at arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Germany's E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined.
These five companies set up a joint venture, named Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty renewable years, the entire gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," Müller said.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was ensured at 30% by the shareholders and at 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure to come back at their own expense, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit gate of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificity of the incoming gas, before it is transferred into German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventure, of hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a off-white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook of design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which designates a varnished cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought back to life an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces sold.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, because the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, has almost 100 today and since 2008 has two offices; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city center and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the trend of the time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, diary, pens, computer cases... The brand is available on a range of supports.
In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy put in place in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the population as a whole.
Disheartening?
"No," said Éric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, there is still a great deal to be done."
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, the obstacles remain many before accessing employment.
They are quite old: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for disabled people, compared with an average of 38%.
In short, these are criteria that make returning to employment particularly difficult, and that "are the node of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit workers with disabilities.
That's for the objective brakes.
There remains the unsaid, the mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from meeting the employment target of 6% of disabled workers set in a law of 1987.
The latest known figures, which date from 2008, report a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, general manager of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, passing from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also translates into real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ workers with disabilities, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before facing the Bleus on Tuesday evening (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match gives them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the platform of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after the move of his striker against Turkey, the Belgian coach has only praise to do about him.
“I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian.
“I want to move forward,” the Lillois assures on his side.
As for the contrast between his performances in the club and in the selection, "it is a whole, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
“I have to take my marks.”
Threatened against Romania on Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not to mention the notion of “pleasure”.
Les Bleus, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supportive,” he says.
Inevitably, this contributes to further strengthening the "special" character of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We've met before."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With kindness, Leekens spoke of "pride".
"Proud" to play "a gala game."
"Proud" also to note - as a "neighbor" - that France has "become a very high level team" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job,” he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be able to share the plane with the Bleus direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting big,” he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll find out in the next few matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimism his back dam against Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams were lacking in realism.
“At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to be played, and an opponent, Bosnia, to be dismantled.
In view of the one-way match (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score a goal outside.
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as hot, even if the game obviously looks "very tight", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are quite convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," said Queiroz's successor.
The draw reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can suffice for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score a goal outside," Bento said.
"We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians so as not to "give them time to think."
It's a good idea, as long as it's realistic this time.
