Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be awarded, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, though the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid such an issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and cheque of 10 million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
It is proposed to donate them to charitable purposes, but it has not yet decided to which specific organization.
During their full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the award.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents “a challenge to take action.”
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the civic association Spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost ochránc<0xC5><0xAF> p<0xC5><0x99>írody Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice (Nature Defenders Society Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded from investors money for his own benefit, Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Nature Defenders Society is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently detained and faces up to three years’ imprisonment.
Brno doesn’t like containers too much to separate the garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle into the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially it requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his companions get mad at me, but that seems too little to me.
It goes without saying that elsewhere it is also not easy to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
by Vagancy
The containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn’t see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the trash was already overflowing from the container.
It’s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city the extra league of hockey, which shames us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other matters so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj region.
"Paroubek" budget removed money from rents and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness allowances or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt all those who govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they relied on the government subsequently to borrow for sensitive expenses, rents or sickness allowances. "That only means postponing the problems for the future, is laying mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest rates and, one day, you have to pay back the money.
The state does not have many options to raise money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or state operating expenses, it has to increase taxes.
To all those to whom the left added now: the firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, his children too.
People don't have to worry about rents or sickness benefits, they'll get them.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year there will be no shortage of just $163 billion in the treasury, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with interest expense.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come with slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity allowances, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion left to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and whose price cannot be reduced.
The most you can do is keep them, which is also not free.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the decrease of funds: it will get money from the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never secure nor is it a bottomless sack.
Last year <0xC4><0x8C>EZ allocated $18 billion to the budget.
Each year the dividends are paid for ecological damage, serve to complete the account for the rents or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of the rents.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Nearly $3 billion was raised from the budget to provide various compensations to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, use the government budget reserve.
There are also 100 million left for the two billion-dollar Státní pokladna (State Fund) project, which has already been launched and which should allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
At the touch of a button, they switch in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This is precisely the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They will be able to switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and U.S. carriers to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Ski lift operators in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e are not the only ones concerned about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That's why in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at offers, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas there will be snow or mud," said Spindl.Info maintainer Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n a New Year's Eve according to their expectations, should not hesitate anymore to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n mainly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what we are most interested in is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the vacancies are still open.
That's why we have already prepared some last-minute holiday stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer free seats.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is undermined by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will run out as well," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year’s Eve and Christmas, we have the last seats available.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
Eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays are already occupied at the Omnia Hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are approximately sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, for the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will spend the longing for snow waiting.
Temperatures should drop on Thursday and, if there is rainfall, it should snow in the mountains.
But then temperatures will rise again, said Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it proved to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the same text, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A new way forward."
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized it as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, proved that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is no mention of Iraq in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, however it objectively left his successor in a much more favorable initial situation than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but came up with nothing better, so at least he tricked the general into 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously counted at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years. The whole Obama doctrine generated more questions than the answers it offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin people, after which the patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relationships, further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is “capable of action,” a minimal goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy clashes with his voluntarism.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to the war to "come home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of the troops is purely irresponsible, since the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential elections are three years away and that is why there is still a lot of time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
The top executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to link bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it should take, said former JPMorgan bank investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after having set aside nearly $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the agency Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, the 20 billion dollars.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a fifty percent tax, bonuses for bankers in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics.
Five women, which is a record number, received today in Stockholm from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden the Nobel Prizes this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as fellow American scientist Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Ada Jonath, Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was awarded to American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analyzing an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
The award was given today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million Czech kronor).
If there are several winners in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and also is at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the chamber of deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota’s stay in the cabinet, is supposed to be the subject of his meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
Speaker Radim Ochvat said.
On his tenure, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved the left’s proposals for transfers of funds and increased money for civil servants’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government on the one hand, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of domestic policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer’s bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the SDG, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Representatives, de facto liquidates the package of savings measures imposed in the fall by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can rely on a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, he said.
SDG leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
SDG Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, SDGs and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences."
The head of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek.
On Wednesday, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were happy too.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, starring Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
History is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong in the global measure to the outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela’s story to theaters.
He had no other goal but to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I receive your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It’s important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met Pienaar at his home for the first time.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, “In the movie I look much taller.”
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
Russia’s defence ministry said it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near its border with Norway.
The "Bulava"-type missile, previously destined to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or there was an air failure.
In the Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as of "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, no problems occurred at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the aircraft.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That’s why it’s likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed “Bulava.”
The Norwegians did not hesitate from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by stating that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile held up and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the above cases the engines broke down immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely error-free, according to the Ministry of Defense management only six of the thirteen failed.
The success of almost fifty percent is full of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to affirm that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed at the age of 51 an annual contract with CSKA Moscow
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return at the age of 51 to a professional hockey match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and is committed to helping the team.
We only have to solve some formal issues, the AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-lived professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, for the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The eldest of the group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and in the junior world championships.
In the second half of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai complied with union requirements. Will cancel all extra work
The management of the car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared the emergency for strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the spokesman for the car factory Hyundai.
The management, however, wants this year to agree with the unions on another Saturday shift.
We cannot resign ourselves to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will be worked in two shifts, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
According to the server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, that is, extend the holidays by one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k mentioned.
Employees at the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists is due on Monday morning.
Union chief Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they commit to meeting the requirements and the document is signed, they are willing to cancel the emergency due to strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent overtime work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management said employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of emergency for strike on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
When it comes to extra work, trade unions demand that the company minimize it.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The Hyundai auto factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently has 2,000 employees.
Mass production began in November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech Discovery: A Substance Effective Even in the ‘Stuck’ HIV Viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs already available.
AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarboranes have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all drugs used today, and so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus’s albumin.
The metallocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV virus fractionation does not occur and mature and infectious virus corpuscles would not be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was performed in test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of metallocarboranes on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metallocarboran compounds interesting for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, the head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Genetics.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG head Mirek Topolánek said the approved budget for next year is "scary" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The SDG statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say there is time for analysis.
SDG Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, SDG and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether in the House of Representatives he wants to rely on the minority, which is trying to fight against the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives increased money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the government’s wish, that the modified budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened resignation in the event of approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>eská televize Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He said he was thinking of staying in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees to another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government have nothing to do the nominees by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly whether he will resign if the house passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those pertaining to sickness subsidies, rents, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: SDG-nominated ministers are not to blame
It's the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the SDGs have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the positions of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the public finance deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it is based on the leftist majority, which is currently in the chamber of deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the SDG members.
I haven’t thought about it, when the time comes, I will deal with it,” Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by SDG members, told reporters in the House of Representatives.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
SDGs relented at the Prime Minister's request
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed, that SDGs on Wednesday in the chamber of deputies would probably vote against the modified budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask the SDGs deputies to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he reacted to the question, whether SDG does not worry about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from office, he knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevism of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>D's new train schedule, fewer trains will run for almost the same fares
<0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule goes into effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dráhy for this line will add a pendulum truck.
The direct train, on the other hand, will not circulate again in Bratislava.
On the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line there will be fewer fast trains, the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by Drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surroundings.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route will also be cancelled and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to only a few weekdays.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
As of December 13, travelers will not return to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The count by the regional railways this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, as this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the fast and local dráhy trains they have a new contract of ten years, until now the contract was always of one year.
Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why they did not increase the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will occur only on one-day tickets - <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and on cheap internet tickets eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
For travelers without a customer card, the <0xC4><0x8C>D Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, until now there was the single price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.
Filipino armed forces continue to detain more than 50 people, children released
The gunmen have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including several elementary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which previously reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 armed men are said to be using the hostages as a live shield in their escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
The armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police previously pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, whose cause was the settling of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the governor’s election were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of RSA concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official title in Czech is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>) will be released in theaters in the United States, which captures a part of the biography of the former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the lead role.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the release they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, together with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa culminate preparations for the world championship in football. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the lead roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember Mandela’s character and message.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the costume of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election term.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as protagonist also puts on the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA won at that time the world cup.
For entering the grassroots in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship will perhaps help people unite and form a nation, rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team, mentioned in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as for example said in an interview recently for LN a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has caught a <0xC4><0x8C>eps transformer in a switch box near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsko.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, the spokesman for the firefighters of the <0xC3><0x9A>stí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, however later they changed their mind and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company’s spokeswoman, the breakdown does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of <0xC4><0x8C>eps' activity nothing similar happened, breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, spokeswoman for <0xC4><0x8C>EZ for the northern Czech Republic, the power supply was not cut, and the fire at the power substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps p<0xC5><0xAF>sobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical conduction.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, in addition to maintaining the electric conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to file slander complaint against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD hetmans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today will file a slanderous complaint against three social democratic Turks.
These are Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> kraj and the Olomouck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj hetman Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in Twenty minutes on Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
Demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the raisins from the cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing but to defend ourselves.
It is for slandering the Student Agency society, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
At the same time, he mentioned that he had the evidence of all the regions and that they had not taken the necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this complaint to be the continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hethmans to do so too.
I suppose, also on this occasion it will be clearly shown, that Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Mr Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek mentioned.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that he would invest several million kroner in advertising, whose goal would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy to maintain regional railway links and for the order of approximately 150 billion kroner did not call a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a <0xC4><0x8C>SSD deputy, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we don't leave, we might lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a deputy of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know, which gentleman it is, I will not say his name, said Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today for Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
Pneumococcal Vaccine Will Be Free and Voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the compulsory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have already made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The New Vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born since August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier, have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be received between the third and fifth month of age of child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily allowed their children to be vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 kroner and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450,000 crowns annually on vaccines.
However, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state spent for all the vaccination of children approximately 500,000 annually.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Pneumococcal infections in our country die every year according to research in hospitals 28 children no older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic pneumococcal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, at the same time there are opinions, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by the insurance companies and voluntary.
The mandatory vaccination would be better, said Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Their association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfiedwith the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we have to take now, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this moment we do not think about it at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary Vaccine Has Its Disadvantages, Doctors Say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost praktick<0xC3><0xBD>ch d<0xC4><0x9B>tsk<0xC3><0xBD>ch léka<0xC5><0x99><0xC5><0xAF> Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
"In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents will allow their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococci.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, then save on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about buying vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies could “take the money out of health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid for by insurance companies.
It is estimated, that pediatricians will invest in vaccinations 40,000 per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 pictures in his vehicle and trailer.
They say Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official said a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, told police that his father had ordered him “to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse.”
The agency said Father Frazetta denied granting such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Finance Minister also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a cap of 1% in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished by a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The rise in Social Security spending, which will grow by about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a jobs tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, as of April 2011
Economy to contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonds
The 1 point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax relief for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will gain <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the extra tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and spending cuts outlined were a “grain of sand in the desert” compared to what was needed.
"These are big numbers, it will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit will be reduced, have been questioned after the Finance Minister was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while the loan order would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Wasted Opportunity"
The Conservatives, which will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the Labour party's "debt crisis," said the projected <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan application for the next six years was unsustainable.
The ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, cynically dodging difficult choices until after the June 2010 elections.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the shadow Minister of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour party insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek further deficit reduction in the shorter term.
But Liberal Democrats said the money raised from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sand castles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing for the ads, such as the rising inflation of some next April disability subsidies, would leave the finance minister exposed to allegations of election maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided with the most need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment in public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Tax Studies said the Finance Minister’s figures implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including future transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“This is really postponing the pain for later,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“All important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins,” added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte’s accountants.
"This has been the false pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
FBI Investigates ‘Detentions of Americans in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were detained in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and under what kind of circumstances they are being held,” spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already in the crosshairs of local police and no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the U.S. had to “work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people.”
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian 'abuse'
Human rights in Iran for the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details “models of abuse” of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been sentenced, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the account of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election result.
"They often hit me in the face," according to his words.
“They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted that there had been abuse.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks, at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the discomfort of the post-election and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee’s inquiries had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
He made a ski run in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping ramp, facing a 100-meter-long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that was quite frightening.
You see below a beautiful view of the city lights flickering.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent.”
The prizes were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still they and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and thoroughly argued study of a problem that divided and preoccupied the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France’s 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who plays debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a city hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them of renown, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim scholar and scholar.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not able to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen thinks Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives “an adjustment of values.”
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The World's Most Desolate Landscape
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transportation and fisheries have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a consequence.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of courage by confronting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the tip of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one-millionth of the area of a wild adult's domain. The weather is almost never adequate: a Singaporean resident polar bear turned green by the algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on accounts by other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters on helicopters and Eskimo Indians on snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a chilling, clear account of Arctic science and a startling look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of commitment.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering voyages in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines mapped out the moving ice cords that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system within the Arctic ice, formed by jets of saline water that compress as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... these could be us
Marines Among 6,000 Who Place Crowns at Arlington Tombs
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are being shipped, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it’s us, I’d want someone to do the same for me, so I’m just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place wreaths on veterans’ graves in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased military career.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older tombs from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War because they don’t get as many visits as new tombs, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plaques placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped the tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember it."
Cuban Officials Arrested U.S. Government Contractor
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on Dec. 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything that is considered “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a fledgling blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor could likely spark tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow-paced" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for texting, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available at expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and at some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly inaccurate.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing mobile phones for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the organization Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, same Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's placement as leader of the country, to replace his sickly older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in a day.
He said any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case can help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who search the Internet for radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led the men once in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, away from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke anonymously due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men were unmoved and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani law enforcement authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determines who they are trusted.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people within al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting through those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is looking into aspiring U.S. recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they are hugely attractive, because of their potential to access American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of Thousands Protest in Copenhagen, Demand Climate 'Action'
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets demanding that negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center take bolder action for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number to be closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that read “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish that declared, “Earth says “enough is enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said travel to Peru, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified because he was involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black clothing placed several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the conscience of key officials such as Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I was really not aware of the situation.”
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it was up to each person’s perspective to define whether the march was being detrimental or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
Moreover, “it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Data from a test reveals persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal scorecard on math performance was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best-performing systems, the scorecard showed fourth and eighth graders stride at a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Educational Progress Assessment is the persistent difference in performance between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white fourth graders in D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers rose only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth-grade African-Americans remained essentially steady, dropping a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the targets were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference separating black and white fourth graders in 2003, when the first ENPE in the District was unveiled, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only narrowed to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by catering to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping for a two- or three-point difference, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By Accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Elementary Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city’s high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what worries us is that we are not devoting the time and energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at high school and middle school students who did not master the fundamentals of early reading in their school years and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Math, a math curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, emphasizing real-life games and experiences, that was introduced into the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say ENPE’s findings highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here’s a kind of crude dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important timeline.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to have the force for change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, which she sees as an "indicator" to seek a larger increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The sightseeing bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong reluctance.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, came down and blinked for a moment in front of the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the group’s other eighth graders explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
“This is where I will be,” exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Fuck, seriously?” he said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the school’s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you’re going to go to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the college education they need to enter the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second-generation” Hispanics graduate from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the top performers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela Universities tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to run college preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a leading role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away by bidding on only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached deals for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants at the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the helm, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military pulls out, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest crude reserves, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major fields.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and deliver on its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made bids that were then confronted with the barrel subsidy the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each field.
Al Qaeda's top planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified, CIA-operated aircraft inside Pakistan’s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence agency official said, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally shattered bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military planner, who led the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He conspired around the world, a senior official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from al Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had rapidly ascended the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name to some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Khalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count by The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit.
The decline is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
U.N. envoy in Kabul about to resign
The top U.N. envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign in March, ending a tumultuous term that was hurt by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan’s U.N.-backed presidential election.
The departure from Eide comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the increase, but was concerned that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule that begins in 18 months would prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also lobbied the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who will help with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that he would have time to find a replacement.
What I’ve said is that they’d better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a gap of two months between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun looking for a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the U.N. mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed U.N. peacekeeping missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said Galbraith's allegations, who was fired, "certainly hurt the mission, because there was already too much skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also boosted UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would boost their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermine his ability to attract talent.
So much so that UN rules have allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran over its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population at large.
He argued that it would take “a package of incentives and disincentives,” “to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons,” because “their people will suffer enormously” from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran would face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully comply with the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, he said he would re-negotiate a restriction on his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for the desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such a deal, as a way to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran’s hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they haven’t in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including pursuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement in New York, Iran’s mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday “baseless and baseless accusations” by some members of the Security Council about Iran’s nuclear activities, and said it was willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, “in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution.”
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq’s oil-rich Kurdish region to meet troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. plans, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates’ words to Massoud Barzani, the head of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.”
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters sermoning them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy to just one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China’s one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled only children affectionately nicknamed “little emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy came into effect, according to the Division.
The number of residents aged 60 and over is forecast to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said fertile couples should have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate a future labor shortage.”
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A Gradual Relief
Drafted in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in imposing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they softened many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night, the posters that ordered families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child after the campaign was launched, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still only receiving four to five applications per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to only reach about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu Municipality Family Planning Committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she was too: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two middle-class careers that lower the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents’ struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of parental time, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic "has to have a resume prepared for the best daycares when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference, so far characterized by defiant postures and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations bearing the bulk of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, a senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what U.N. climate chief Yvo de Boer described as "the big picture."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday was the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the conversations last week.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, compared to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier this week that the United States would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States clashing over their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the world’s twenty-four most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the boldest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it’s not surprising that major powers are discussing who should pay for spending to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change advisor for Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the talks will produce at most a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push from small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most exceptional issues before heads of government come to a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister Jairam Ramesh, stepped down from the planes and rushed into the halls of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delimit the claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The utter disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center every day, the activists who play the guitar perform night shows mocking the countries they say are selling, and preliminary proposals are passed hand-in-hand instead of via email) poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain’s first train at 225 km/h redefines Monday’s feeling
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to London’s St Panrcas station, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Neglected secluded areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and switching planes and cars to rail would reduce national coal emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times learned.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-meter radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 metres of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another heading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railroad.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow the trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains 400 meters long, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the capital’s space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts argue that only the St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
Initially the trains would be forced to leave the fast lines along the existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a switch from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers Face Mortgage for a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orange Grove from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built in his constituency home.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living "on rations," raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-framed extension at his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the extra interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said the requests "could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an “orange grove.”
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase during a recent House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges investigation into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 from his London property to the house of his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in mortgage interest, up until March last year.
In April, its applications increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The BRE’s standard variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the rate it is now.
The most recent document issued by House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan was still requesting <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month in May.
Duncan lost his job as opposition Speaker of the House in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive “on rations” after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like shit."
He stated, “I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t.”
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the payroll office that this “could be considered excessive.”
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound sterling symbol in Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after it was revealed that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for overarching improvements, approved by both the payroll office and subsequently by Legg."
He added: “It’s not about circumventing and delinquent or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn’t be any clearer or simpler.”
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the palapa of the beach of Brighton
The Brighton palapas have found new momentum for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using Christmas carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. every day, with stuffed cakes and punch served for free.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid cleric from the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
"Why do we as a Church wait for people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the palapa began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to prove and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police detained several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the icy Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing global climate mobilization, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, smashed windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, headquarters of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was erected to welcome the guest speakers, and former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them wearing raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form “blue tides” for “justice and for the climate”.
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on saying: there’s time, Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo said.
In Africa, there are dry rivers, waterways that can be walked on like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded dressed in red and wearing handkerchiefs with pro-solar energy slogans.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters were rallies calling for strong action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, but Georgia denounces 'fraud'
Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president on Saturday, but Tbilisi denounces "fraud."
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five running candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting.
This election is a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, meanwhile, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," his spokesman, Manana Manchgaladze, said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended in several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large planks show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to monitor the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank the support of Moscow, and very particularly, the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that his country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes control of the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be held two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched in the afternoon in the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was erected to welcome the guest speakers, and former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu led a candlelight vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, smashed windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to police.
We did not take our eyes off the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them wearing raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form “blue tides” for “justice and for the climate”.
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
Oxfam along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with pro-solar energy slogans in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of hundreds of protesters called for action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were gathered.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview to be broadcast in Sunday's Informative (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" by the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all first-year high school students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be sub-branches of the C, he goes on to stress even: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged at having eliminated history and geography in second grade in the technological schools."
An IFOP poll published Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to eliminate compulsory history-geography secondary schooling at high school C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that there is “no talk” about removing philosophy from the C-second high school program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which sacrifices, according to them, the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will take an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will do internships in real conditions during the year of M2, then will be a first year in front of the classroom as internship teachers.
If you do all the practices proposed before the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also confirmed the project to remove the school map “before 2012.”
At the École Normale Supérieure, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the "Ernest" conference wheel, a day consisting of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that would appeal to people and convey the desire to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called just as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is founded on a very serious scientific record".
Videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school’s website starting Dec. 15.
The next "Ernest" day is expected in February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Delay in payments: disgust among prison guards, action planned
Prison guards' unions called for a "general mobilization" on Friday to demand payment before the holidays, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers’ Force (2nd Guards Union) asked out-of-service staff to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block” them to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them to "meeting in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", because it calls "shameful and unacceptable" the non-compliance of the payment in December of "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury".
The Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were counted, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Foreign Ministry reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of guards guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who "always blame the budgetary requirements," Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, said indignant the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and summonses".
The staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if those of the month of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without taking more personnel, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But in any case, the result is not as expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Gives 'Better Gifts' Than He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas in the White House, confessed to famous television host Oprah Winfrey that he came to a simple conclusion regarding gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will air Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holidays at their prestigious new residence.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way, last year I gave you nice gifts," she said, teasing the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering humorously pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bicycle, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he seldom saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
The first lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to arrange a house, so I put all the furniture in line against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Claims He's in Induced Coma
Johnny Hallyday was resurrected in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was intervened again on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors found "injuries arising from the operation" of a herniated disc performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in that same city said, indicating that these injuries "needed a repair operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquility by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical party would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about their condition, RTL adds.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula was introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Monceau Park international clinic due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted Monday to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles from an infection stemming from Delajoux's surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured that there was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
“He called me just before I was going to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to take a 12-hour flight after such an operation, it’s not possible,” said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure by claiming that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had undergone surgery for "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is exaggerated, with fans and journalists noticing the musician’s difficulties in moving onstage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favourite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Long-Pool Championships, won an international title on Thursday in a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m freestyle, during Euro-2009 in the short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were broken when in fact many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m freestyle, mark he owns in long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in the 50 m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatia’s Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia’s Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30) as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that will be banned from January 1st.
These swimsuits, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of swimsuits did not help German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in the 400 m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give up completely in this race.
I knew that this time I was not going to be able to break a world record, but I managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Zola’s sarcophagus panel sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged to French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel, 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century AD, and its price had been estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is a rare piece, since in the world there are only four or five," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bid by buyers, without a doubt, said a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as part of her bathtub in her Parisian private mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico said conditions were not in place to transfer to its territory the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied safe conduct.
For the moment, after an evening telephone conversation with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
To grant him a safe haven, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renunciate" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a guest acting head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my post (...), they wanted me to present my resignation," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been five months in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, who has been a refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a safe-conduct request, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya responded in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya’s departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the ousted president, who gathered around Brazil’s embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government’s position.
That reflects the marginal character of this government against international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures are faithful witnesses to the economic recovery of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points to reach 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points to reach 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused primarily on U.S. trade balance figures, “reflecting an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, in particular exports of goods, which reflect the growth of major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, with 474,000 applications filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power boo the "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of the government of Raúl Castro as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, said an AFP journalist.
Let the Yankees die!, “Mercenaries!”, “The street belongs to the revolutionaries!”, “Long live Fidel and Raúl!” chanted the militants of the power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by officers dressed in civilian clothes who came to “protect” them.
On the eve, a similar demonstration was unleashed against the “Ladies in White” in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day, were detained by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, an AFP journalist reported.
The officers forcibly climbed the vehicles of the dissidents who were booed by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "solicit the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call opponents “mercenaries” or “agents” at the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of government militants against the "counterrevolutionaries".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Thursday at the peak of the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have beaten with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elderly man, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No 85 of Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses reported.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in hospital, according to an official of the Alliance police union.
Later in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, stepped in and was wounded.
The first two victims, who were seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the elderly man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then fainted and was hospitalized "in shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: a man of thirty, and another of forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher's knives that he had crossed in his back, said a representative of the Alliance union in the Hauts de la Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alienated, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They couldn’t do it because the guy was strong, Alberto, a bartender at a nearby bar, explained.
A crowd came upon him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were punched, according to police testimony.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a wounded man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor, and when I put him in a safe position, I felt a very important wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, approximately 35 years old, arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers detained the man without identity papers.
The Prosecutor of Nanterre submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his pre-trial detention, he did not speak.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of him being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "everything disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for dismissal
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, be dismissed for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "The Pianist," denounced to three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel said: “I complain that the charges are dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, “was chilling.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) would have conversed with a prosecutor who would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before handing down sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells finally declared in late September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never stepped foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “has to be here to appear at the hearing.”
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing,” Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker “asks for a favor from the court, although he despises its authority.”
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to hand down his sentence, also stressed “that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee.”
Hummel was not the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She argues that her client can no longer stand to be harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: “No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his cabin in Gstaad, awaiting eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses direction and slows down by dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed without direction on Friday, in a market that is struggling between better indicators than those predicted in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technology component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of trade is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was sustained thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery," summarized Charles Schwab analysts.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence recovered visibly in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary index estimate.
However, the indices were slowed by a new rise of the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are on the final straight to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of one billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second year in a row around Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportswoman or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
“I saw so many things and had innumerable experiences,” said Miss Sierra Leone.
This contest, which will be held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m.
I can't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very glad to have lived twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and by the possibility of rediscovering "breathtaking African landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World candidates concentrate on the contest.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, in swimsuits.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The distended son of the singer assured that he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to an infection derived from the operation of herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already undergone a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday from an infection, following a herniated disc operation on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated on once again Wednesday night to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The Head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic of Monceau Park, in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly with the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice for a herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before, on RTL, he indicated that the singer had apparently "gone without a cannula, with nothing", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a bruise formed following a brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the justice on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being advisable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Either way, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a bracket.
Undoubtedly, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems very risky to me, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union pour la Démocratie Française), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former Giscardo party, inviting him to remove it from all support, under penalty of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having extended his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of its management, it received the help of the deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark, as he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch an injunction to the Minister and the deputy ordering them to renounce the acronym and transfer the property rights of the brand, under penalty of legal action.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you would propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the movement's name, the "Nouveau centre", and the slogan "l'UDF d'aujourd'hui" in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the signatories of the letter maintain.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the office of the UDF that demands that the NC remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium, as well as from (your) website".
It also asks Hervé de Charette “to transfer ownership of (the) mark to the legitimate right-holders.”
Failure to do so will result in an appeal to justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they point out that the UDF "has been a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Center has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It exploits scandalously and fraudulently the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the strategy of the NC: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to put the artist François-Marie Banier on trial to determine if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to plunder a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his pictures of stars of the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter compete for the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the No. 15 Correctional Court also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday must submit a report before March 10, 2010 in which they must state if Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and for what periods.
I think she'll accept.
"I'm going to talk to her," Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as he left the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
The expert report will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed criminal charges against François-Marie Banier, a multi-faceted photographer and artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of his mother’s weakness for years to obtain one billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, as the court examined the provenance of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers’s action, the lawyers’ arguments were, on some occasions, a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to talk to Françoise again.”
For its part, the Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to give way to her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear in court, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his stead,” said Attorney General Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule once the judgment on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers had been made.
Management Revolution or the End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to "values" determined from above as before it was about imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more so, business intelligence.
Indeed, Business Intelligence “demands that all parties involved ... have a proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision”; it needs from employees a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we called for a managerial revolution, which would consist in putting employees at the center of the concerns of the company as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as Orange’s employee questionnaire, incite management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory that the American “neurosciences” recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the “commands” (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a posture of mechanistic management, unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies means adopting a finalistic view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating into every reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring mobilization factors, company managers can monitor, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and relocate human resource management “on the spot”.
In this way, they create a favorable terrain for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for 'just war' Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of a "just war" against America's enemies, hailed the speech Obama had delivered on Thursday.
The conservatives, who had discredited Obama’s Oct. 9 award, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Ms. Palin, a leading figure in the right wing of the Republican party, to USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself on Thursday in Oslo to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama adversary, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former Speaker of the House rejoiced, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For a moment, the speech seemed very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider a possible candidate for the Republican investiture for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear from “a leftist president” when he reminded the Nobel Committee members “that they would not be free nor could they hand out a peace prize if the use of force did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current Washington Post columnist, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as he “always does,” he “speaks like an American president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a bubble of security that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few not very convinced right-wingers, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton called the speech “monotonous, pretentious and uninspiring” on the Internet site National Review Online.
To the left of the president, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the centre-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, though still believing Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "overproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the Californian newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was necessary," the New York Times said, deeming it "both gloomy and uplifting."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers’ organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that ends the strike slogan and the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau was “joyed” by the agreement, after several negotiation sessions that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in hopes of quickly signing the text by late morning.
Even though three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by knocking on the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "feared it would disrupt the holiday season," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some disgruntled rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common-sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "an historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow above all to address the issue of an extraordinary pay and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employers' burdens" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "under the same terms."
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to the companies attached to this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers’ organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "business of the naive", since the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to upset those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, Unostra lamented.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: Conflicts over the weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
Conflicts on RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, the second day of a strike between unions and RATP management, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday there will only be trains between 10 am and 8 pm, at the rate of one train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train in four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers each day, were delighted that "RATP is striving to service large stores."
The RER A crosses the Parisian city from West to East.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains ran at rush hour, and almost no trains at valley hours, as had been predicted.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the <0xC3><0x8E>le de France.
Thus, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by SNCF coming from or destined for Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the subways.
New general assemblies of striking workers will be held on Saturday and Sunday and the results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting held with the management on Friday afternoon will be analyzed.
The Director of the ERNs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol on all aspects of the ERN A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium owed to them want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts in parenthesis its premium proposals, the CGT commented indignant, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is planned on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of exercise of the profession", the RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company “didn’t care about weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, who had previously refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after UNSA and the Independents filed a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has one million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for schedules with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just extended a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the court, Hasim Kiliç, told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are set aside from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of party assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that deputies would leave parliament before being unlabeled partisan parliamentarians.
The ruling comes after Supreme Court Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007 accused the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes as the government extends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the Southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
Law enforcement dropped tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators dropped Molotov bombs or slingshots.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also gathered.
After the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen the discouragement.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by dissolving a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
This will not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snow can start suddenly.
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not at all is something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of winter road maintenance of the FES
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
Meteorologists may announce it for the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections leave with large vehicles with salt, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access for firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloped sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts around 3 a.m.
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES starts around three o'clock in the morning, "with this the roads are free until the rush hour traffic begins".
The hard part is when it starts snowing around 7:30 am.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of winter road maintenance, "because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the discomfort is generated, Brauburger tastes good.
Around five o'clock in the morning the infantry of the FES is launched, mainly clearing dangerous points and cruisers.
Typically, the FES would not be able to take over all of the bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22:00 to 4:30 pm does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the vehicle with salt starts as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The Cradle of the Dinosaur
The Tawa hallae had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters tall that ran on the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report in Thursday's Science journal.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea at the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we’ve found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day—this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member at the Utah Natural History Museum.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they gathered the remains of five specimens in total.
Finding Confirms Theories About Ancient History of Dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, comments for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithisaurus belongs to the herbivorous trinvors (for example).
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, in Tawa’s skull, researchers found signs of air pockets, such as those also possessed by the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa's case, the bones of the spine were also evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the later giant sauropods also possessed airbags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves migrating to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers deduce that saurians first emerged there.
Accordingly, the three genealogical lineages were separated at first and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single landmass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa the remains of two other not closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in modern-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare collateral line from reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs expanded around the world and many new species developed, while kinship became extinct at the Triassic boundary towards the Jurassic.
Success stories weren’t eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slowed the rise of a group of species, which had also already evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt has had worldwide repercussions.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command".
The eviction represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to “delegitimize and criminalize protest” and divert attention from the content.
The Board of Directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
The teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimate protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Federation also express their solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for Verdi’s own future, says Verdi’s national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen defended, however, the performance of the university rector and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in a broadcast of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday at the Wiesbaden provincial parliament.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to the vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a delegate of the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the students’ arguments and demands, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret arms research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from downtown Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important centers of research and production of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, Selenograd representatives have been in contact with the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of close collaboration".
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov headed the Russian delegation; head of planning services Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research center will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
It also deals with trade relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortiums Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the wooded mountain landscape, on which research facilities were settled.
Brakes of Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not placed at all high enough.
For the supporters of the project it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
The so.S21 law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end in the middle of the city, were considered at that time 19th century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes of modern rail traffic, as it formerly took a huge amount of time to engage the locomotives backwards and forwards.
Roll, dry stop continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a crossing station, which is about halfway along the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be launched, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement reduction.
The railway terminals of course also do not have more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE section built towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have arranged it this way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the designer’s computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition from low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros are to be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the Ministry of Transport list.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the slow-paced layout has been built.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley stretch will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the ruling on the airport.
The federal government leaves the autonomous parliament of Wiesbaden pending whether it will file an appeal against the ruling on the night flight ban of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the more than 400-page VGH ruling, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had reasoned in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt airport, the state would have to regulate again the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 pm and 5 am, as foreseen by the federal government, would not be reconcilable with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to file an appeal against the ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal to the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of a word.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination, which the federal government would be attempting by misrepresenting the law and tricks yet obtaining its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a bit of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally flawless decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, his group’s claims about the night air traffic ban would never have been.
U.S. banks are repaying the loans.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripping themselves of their state bonds.
The “Bank of America” returned in one go the aid it had received from the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report by CNBC of the United States.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had raised approximately $19 billion in cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had plenty of means, among others by the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers on Wednesday night especially: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the effort of the investment bank’s absorption at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money in the capital market to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source in known circles that the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion capital increase by Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
In June they had already returned their aids Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
The Quick Choice
In the end, everything went faster than we thought.
Just two weeks after the board of ZDF (German television channel) pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to step down, the channel can nominate a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main studio of the ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also influenced not to harm ZDF director Markus Schächter any further, if this proposal would also not be approved by the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 guild members.
The result of the vote was not yet finalized at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender’s contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated, they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the President of the Hessian government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument that under Brender’s direction ZDF news outlets would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which political influence over the ZDF was scourged.
In the end, 35 specialists in public law had even meddled in the debate, describing Koch’s conduct as unconstitutional.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked for the radio station "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Greens' political party announced a constitutional lawsuit following the impeachment of Brender, who was chosen as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin" on Wednesday.
Koch's opponent in the administrative council, the Rhineland-Palatinate government president, explained last week that the federal states should change the ZDF state convention in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the ZDF control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board of directors with a clever move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to appoint him to the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the position to a partisan henchman.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is attributed anyway to the liberals of the left.
College careers are clearing up
Partial success for the students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally gave in. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor and master.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the course should end with only one exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities in and outside Germany.
The Länder are committed to making the structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor and Master degrees.
Regulations of the federated states that differ from this, should no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have been continuously talking about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now, for the first time, a specific topic has been discussed.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam," says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university degrees.
The "sensitive reduction of the burden of exams" is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be thoroughly examined for unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of..
the courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage self-initiative".
These rules would apply to new races, but also to examining existing races.
These must be "re-credited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until the year 2015 to examine all the races.
Those responsible for this would be at the countrywide level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is installed by the federated states.
The education and culture ministers urged the federal states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to adopt such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinate has provided additional means for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam and overseas offices.
The federal government and universities are seeking <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, a single exam should suffice for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the course should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
By the end of next year, it is intended to examine all careers about their "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federated state.
Aside from praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
At the federal-level board of the Juso university groups (young socialists) it was demanded that the shaping of education policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of university ministers and rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, students should now be able to give their opinion as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: “We need the experience of the students,” she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the education and science trade union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the trade union demands a legal right for every student with the Bachelor’s degree to access a subsequent Master’s degree.
In addition, the states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough places to study for Master with the best possible conditions of study, as reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federated states have to hire quite a few more teachers.
But about greater access to the master’s degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is virtually unchecked," says the first line of a poem by lyricist Werner Söllner in imbalanced idiom fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arriving in Germany by a dissident, who won his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the memorable lectures or poetry lectures in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the Literature Forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He gave a lot of talk last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted involvement as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Attempts at recruitment had begun slowly, in early 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against the attempts of Securitate to provoke fear," Söllner concluded.
The lyrical Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the awarding of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that shows the abysses and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his Securitate IM file Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him on all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this statement,” he said.
Söllner’s statement in this form and in front of this public was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Securitate-Spitzel Wesen, Herta Müller wrote as early as July in the weekly "Zeit" after reading her own 914-page dossier.
Those involved must have speculated and in some cases known what names were hiding behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment of the Securitate’s control files is still quite fuzzy.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Clarification of the Records of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler Authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the records since then has been rather haphazard.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, following the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite great. In this interview a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke derogatoryly of the decorated.
"She has psychosis," in the end she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself unyieldingly in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, unavoidable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there are quiet blames.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession makes it hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the craving for knowledge and not so much by the attribution of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, it is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, he gave the impression that an elegantly dressed foreign service member was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The bald man had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
Besides, he could have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old drunk with joy.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we reached the round of 16", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Romania's Unirea Urziceni, "but we can not let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sweepstakes
The Champions League round of 16 (one-way on 16/17 and 23/24 February/lap on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy for the fulminant entry of Babbel’s successor remained limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired the bewildered professionals of Stuttgart self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to concentrate on their strengths, urged them to be more thrown, explained the soul repairman Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer had effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "when in football a new impulse arises, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to an injury quickly advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what had been missing, evidently, when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, sports director Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart above all needs consistency.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the win against a defense weakened by lack of relays and totally overwhelmed by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had come the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not feel like celebrating his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions made by others, not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
The latter had reproached weakness in the management of the board, which had decided to change coaches due to the pressure of the teenage fans.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by sheer selfishness," Heldt said, and announced consequences for the defender.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two forty-somethings.
But at least they agreed with all the others that, without the previous efforts with the substitute coach’s team, the spectacle of great play and battle might not have been possible.
Babbel and her assistants had “a significant share in the success,” Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World Heavyweight Championships
Burning duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnsonn has been teasing world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version beat American Kevin Johnson in Bern on Friday night by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform the knockout that everyone had been waiting for.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first loss in his 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight mostly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging again and again the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right hand to his goal.
Generally speaking, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already caused a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie", who "cannot do anything".
As he weighed, the champion was provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he then defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba in his title defenses and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I only received one hit, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to reunite all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters in height.
The previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
The case of Kunduz
Opposition Frontal Attack: Green group leader Jürgen Trittin called Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has blamed Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) for knowingly deceiving.
On Saturday's news broadcast "Tagesschau", broadcast by the ARD television channel, the head of the Green group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without regard to the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy, and whether the chancellery, army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Greens colleague Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, resolutely rejected the criticism.
The foreign ministry had no influence on concrete actions by the German military in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised over the Ministry's presentation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, it emerged from the environment of the two high-ranking officials that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert would have asked in a letter for clarification of the matter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
So far, no response has been received, he said.
The ministry did not comment on Saturday on the accusations made against it, and said this would be clarified in the commission of inquiry of the Federal Parliament, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and the drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unhindered indulge in the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, whoever experiences sleep-like states during waking, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is considered most often in the modern Western world to be mad or drug addict, or at least maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or the drugged.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to blur.
Dream-modified states of alertness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and the psychoses and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and insane thoughts often occur.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the nonsense, formations of madness, and hopes".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
Its body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red grimaces like blood, deformed, grinding their teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Screaming, evil voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls out two wires from the stereo, ties them up to form a hanging knot, and fastens them on a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs into a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope is loosened.
Let it serve you as a lesson!, shout the voices in a chorus that bursts his eardrums, "go to the clinic and have yourself healed!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, taking medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the most profound despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, disorders in the relationship, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the gates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the general psychiatric clinic of the Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning addressed to him.
At the same time he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations rely on reality, the distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers it is still unknown why our brains make cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can cause anyone to temporarily lose contact with reality.
But not everyone develops a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a previous disposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis because they interfere with the brain’s transmitting system.
When the brain heats up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychoses, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and cranioencephalic trauma .
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or under-inhibited; when our brain heats up, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of loves or other brain states of exception.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Recht der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those pictures and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her with surprise; no one but her hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she’s not dreaming.
She’s awake and she sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he can sometimes not follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the sleep to arrive, which is often late and scarce, he does not know whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding cuts in his arms and legs, appear before his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he yells at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't told her anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She approved last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations have been gone for a year.
Since she’s come in contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows she’s not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he will start to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and is in charge of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was as a child afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he has been calling daddy since he had the use of reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," Kasten says, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies nighttime fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that her patients appreciate her hallucinations as a special skill.
Borderline situation between sleep and hallucination
In this world too consciously focused, imaginary experiences are usually pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic of the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
The dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later can not differentiate from being awake.
Dream conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or of the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, this replaces a very dangerous real situation with a proper and imaginary world that is decoupled from reality.
A form of borderline situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a change of world occurs, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own capacity of creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old when his conscience embarked on several-day journeys following heart valve surgery with heart transplantation included, while his body was doomed to immobility in the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he found himself prostrate in bed, an elderly man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
It was seen in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle abducted him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so it describes your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in the irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations, and narcotics show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The children will take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new editor Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told Spiegel.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to Spiegel.
The details have been fixed as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if you are trained to do so.
One cannot put their children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will step down from January as chairman of the board and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for the technology.
After Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure, he also took over direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance, and was responsible for the company’s assets.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the cusp of the publishing house.
Burda’s sons are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who was currently 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decay: "This has always affected families who are infected by the eagerness to seek capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise up as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I’ve never had “delusions of greatness,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play with Time in the world league either; those businesses have gotten too big.
Integral beauty
Everything you can wish for – in terms of beauty and well-being – at your fingertips.
This is what seems to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the commercial center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which takes care of laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the tea shop stands out, with more than 130 different kinds of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a session of jacuzzi, massages and a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered Spaxión.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'coaches' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal key on a touch screen in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-ups and stretches) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of recovery of hair, luminosity or nutrition in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 am to 22:00 pm.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never too late to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costumes.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and the work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 ‘Electric Cities’
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular to energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved when it comes to the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has active a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, envisions "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The chief executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, alluding to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "by 40%" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and fans of motorsport.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of motoring.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of classic engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, catering; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Clásicos, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the stop and start system of the engine -baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good mark achieved in its entirety.
The finishes, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver’s seat, we check that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
The touch of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument cluster and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style is partly reminiscent of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cockpit, this Japanese compact presents a habitability more than enough for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk with regular shapes.
The engine’s automatic stop and start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-liter, 150-horsepower petrol engine and the six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, its reduced noise, for its performance and for achieving low consumption.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers per year should not discard this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high ride comfort, and for its low consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of standard elements.
A special feature of the standard equipment is the Lane Change Assist (RVM) which eliminates blind spots, traction and stability controls, speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent climate control, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, as if its equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in its class.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their performance and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can opt for this version i-Stop, associated only with the petrol engine 2.0 of 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day great doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexy' at the premiere of 'Nine' (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It’s just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with smartphones already know what it’s like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and should have been in operation for a long time.
Yes, some carriers have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission’s repeated pushes to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (it is curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of rates means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It’s a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime-access purchase option like the one Peek already has in the US.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's color scheme
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the American First Lady.
If he has already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States in a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish yellow with bright reflections -, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric -, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat dressaurio.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the takeover it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with a print.
The complements have also varied: green half-heeled shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a collected on this occasion, mane releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and career path of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to motherhood.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, start cohabitation as a couple, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time of their vital trajectory to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on motherhood, although less on the timing of pairing", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when marrying and having the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which they marry and have their first child.
The difference also remains between women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years old, those who had elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"There is also another division between women based on their level of education.
While those with elementary education get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those with middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and prioritize obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, singing the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the men’s section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (‘Grey’s Anatomy’) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s partner in ‘Lost’).
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - designers and models of yesterday and today - gathered at the annual awards ceremony, held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Poker de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also for the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the creative character.
The trip has its excites and Vicent does not spare scares or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and rereadings.
Here I leave you some snapshots.
In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same one I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling, senseless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the way of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed along the northern wall, from which the best climbers climb again and again."
William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was heir to a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry thrown from a bridge by that character from Munich to carry his echo to the end of the twentieth century night under his literary form and did it on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
One day she got on her knees and prayed, “Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.”
On his tombstone were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort, / after the storm the harbor, / the rest after the war, / after life full pleases death.'
On Virginia Wolf: "In the baggage she also brought her depressions.
Her husband would normally accept that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
There has never been a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent went before her madness.
On Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to do but pass Baroja by Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct the fame of that man to serve him as his own pedestal?”
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a mixed race specimen, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, they gave him two kicks that left the dog injured.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a gratuitous aggression on a small and defenseless animal, which by the way, was tied.
To this must be added the swelter that caused a lady who walked quietly and who, when she rebuked these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energumen who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event occurred at five o’clock in the afternoon on any Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubted would be useful for a lot and not to generate susceptibilities, only to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spaniards.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to mistreat for free a defenseless animal that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among younger motorcyclists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only protection element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and said that it also contributes to this goal through other actions of a pedagogical and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet in the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safer products.
The sale of light commercials is on the rise
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decreases, according to figures from the employers of manufacturers Anfac and that of sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not obstinate, should be quarantined since the reference with which the comparison is made -November 2008- was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the uptick of the last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold, together with all the vehicles that make up the tailor’s drawer of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light trucks / chassis.
Likewise, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
In addition to the restrictions imposed by the closed tap on bank loans, there are other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Given this scenario and unlike the cars, the aid to the purchase of the 2000E has served little.
They can be used, in addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they again recalled the need to devote special attention on the part of the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrial ones (trucks and buses).
The sales association forecasts a 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now compulsory
As with ABS anti-lock brakes and will pass ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while for the rest a period of absence is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase pedestrian protection although, by its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by range.
The emergency braking assistant increases the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver’s foot.
But it doesn’t always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not hit the brakes before the collision and half of them did not take full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum from the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided a year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four losses with damage to people would be avoided - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors Delays Plan for Opel to January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - on the 8th probably - as Javier Ortega reports, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this may cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM says a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
Not surprisingly, the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to contacting some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but gains strength from Dutch sports car maker Skyper, which is backed by Russian group Converg.
In case there is no deal with either of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision remains to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop his latest, expensive gem, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, of the automatic roof that has been replaced by one of canvas with manual drive, with which they save 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 kilos more; mounting sports bacquets other 12 inches and with the llanes.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door handles for ones of fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was conducted on a six-speed manual gearbox unit, mainly on California side roads, on mountain stretches with really twisted tracks.
Their behavior can only be described as flawless.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not tread the asphalt with lead.
Quite the opposite: we hadn’t tested a model so small and lightweight that, at the same time, conveyed so much safety in cornering, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles in a short gear for as long as necessary, until we order him to squeeze, to brake, to recover and to re-squeeze his motor...
Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine boom, already released previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration capability is brutal, either from standstill or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the potholes well.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that is that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, already early in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is something more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, with a price tag of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' shows, the singer lavishes her bagface with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', she's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant 82-91 victory in its visit to the complicated court of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous losses counted by the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and in this way it is in the lead of its group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 of evaluation).
The Victorian team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with great doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer to the end to take the victory.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match started face-to-face for the Blue Grenade, who put themselves from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already foreshadowed that they had jumped on the Israeli court with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac’s inner play and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with cocks and applause on the return to which was his home, to continue expanding his advantage to the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'minus six' assessment of Splitter already foreshadowed that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on track to the break, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court does not win anyone, and with 'the hand of Elias' squeezing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning the bright (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Ivanovic's wounded but not dead, needed to spin a couple of moves with success to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaveses left to leave their skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, the Ivanovic did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the game already had owner and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent battle at Unicaja
Unicaja lost in Greece to Olympiacos and gave it the lead of Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the losses of the boxers, especially in the interior game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the rival entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from baseman Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which time an action, conato of fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to function showing its superiority within both zones, where the loss by injury of English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jimenez, were weighing on the boxers.
Between the infielders and the Lithuanian goalkeeper Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible remake
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, which despite 19 losses, was superior and even came to equal the difference of the meeting played in Malaga 66-48, 27 minutes, which made the group lead wobble.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last loss of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the drawbacks the Unicaja for the direction and the triples of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when squeezed and given its superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to retake the basketball average 81-62, 37th minute, and the Unicaja went out, giving the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is running, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly remunerated", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross per year and a French programmer 31,059 euros, compared to the 24,000 euros that a Spanish programmer receives.
Similarly, a driver charges <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>34,247 net per year in England, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,751 in France and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by that of dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, when he would officially end his term.
Francisco Catunda, business manager of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows that he must leave before that date the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination.”
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the status of political asylee that the "de facto" government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchases and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar at rates close to zero for financial institutions to purchase assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are almost over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand in the gears like the ECB did with its year-to-year auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reductions.
Stock market volatilities and corporate bond spreads have rebounded, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and the public debt is again affected.
Once again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the haven chosen by investors, causing a widening of the differentials of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but Standard & Poor's arrived and threatened with a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence moral risk advocates who were again trying to raise awareness on those responsible for world economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what would have to be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to rebuild power in the emirates and Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on its external payments earlier this year and to allow a euro member country to breach its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to hold its citizens jointly accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads expand like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If the European spreads decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise upwards their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "prudence, driver friend".
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is debated these days.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a glimpse of what he had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion until 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants that are currently operating are kept open.
If not, the necessary investments will not be $60 billion, but up to $95 billion.
Of course, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue changes and the power will already have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with mechanisms for capturing carbon dioxide and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW new are needed, yes, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Bill just passed by the Government is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts policies to fight climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term commitment" in this regard, despite the "point" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must be started as they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling at 10 airports
Swiss Swissport, the subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, which has not gone beyond the economic terms, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Innovation Center for Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Australia's first motorway disputed with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway in concession in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are their rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a builder and highway concessionaire.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for the public-private partnership (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan supervised by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortiums with a notable presence of European construction companies compete.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in the race, and their companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium plays against the Acciona team, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screen is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Gala firm specialized in civil works Razel share capital.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatizations, but it entails a clear difficulty of entry if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Barely ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Million-dollar assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of lifting and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The underground toll road, promoted by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (Northern Link), is called to connect the western Toowong Highway with the Kelvin Grove Ring Road (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The calendar set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this payment step would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear significant fruit to Hochtief, which announced yesterday that it had been awarded a contract with the Government worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and give the German company a job for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. Work was yet to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale for 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The firm gets this contract days after taking over the extension works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its expertise in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its execution period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore awards Renfe advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
Mrs. Rushmore has been chosen among the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition called by Renfe of which four were finalists, among them TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million for curbing competition
France’s competition regulator has fined France Télécom <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for anti-competitive conduct in the country’s Caribbean regions.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has, in fact, been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to data from UEFA.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have gone well in this division.
The white club has been the third on the continent to have pocketed the most money to participate, and the only one, along with AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also earned the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved more money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution (biology)
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA’s complicated money-sharing procedure.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
From this money UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atletico Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each match they play.
There are also bonuses to be won (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and tied (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eight fourth-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket $4 million each.
The champion will win $9 million, versus the finalist's $5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are destined.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four assigned places.
The previous year's champion takes 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The group Nueva Rumasa yesterday unraveled the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a takeover bid (OPA) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be paid with an interest for this deferral of 1% annually
Yesterday the shares of SOS closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If realized, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, SOS continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and the judicial turmoil of their former managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a new position that will depend directly on the president of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle over the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from SOS to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months SOS will reveal new diversions of funds.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Court and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorizes the exclusion bid of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion bid presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation because it understands that its terms comply with the current rules and considers "sufficient" the content of the explanatory brochure presented after the amendments introduced on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which he specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of current regulations.
New tools for driving cars
In these days of thunderstorms and accidents, not only the car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No claim is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Annually, the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service and solutions providers for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, then developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms that compete in the field of appraisal tools and elaboration of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data supplied by manufacturers is far from straightforward.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that more versions, variants and engines have been launched in the last five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car hits the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very arduous task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is made of each model where different tourist parts can be "pinched".
If it is a wind mass model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile fleet that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros per year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data are included each month, and customers receive updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used ones in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the star product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for claims assessment, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles, and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the estimated repair times by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each rating.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expert reviews, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle moons, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows you to bid for vehicles declared total loss.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by brands or models.
One can study, for example, how many models of a certain brand have gone through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious losses in a given period.

It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Online Auction of Accidented Cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could be expanded next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sale service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scrappers and professional sellers who must register before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included every day in the Spanish market.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been removed cannot be re-circulated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be registered even if they have been dropped after some difficult efforts.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate a quote.
Ease of use is an essential constraint for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent tend to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 off-roaders, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, an actual graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an evaluation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
The company Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
