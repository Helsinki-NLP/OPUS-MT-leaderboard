The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), Kärnten’s deputy prefect Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the social democratic party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the vote, compared to the last elections in 2006 but loses 5.5%.
Even worse went for <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost with 25.6% almost 9% of the vote.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in Austrian post-war history and especially the literally catastrophic result of the popular, which resulted in early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage over SP<0xC3><0x96> in their preferences.
But voters have obviously punished them for sinking the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe it could take place as early as Monday during the extraordinary convening of the party leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly probable way out of the electoral result, namely towards the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) gained 18% in advance and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11% of votes - but the social democrats at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists even agreed with the popular to the collective government, (then the FP<0xC3><0x96> was part of the reason it was still united, in 2005 it was separated from the EU.
Haider has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to enter the Parliament, but it fell slightly, dropping among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has crossed the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can get colder
If the problem could not be resolved with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegal beetle harvesting in India, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not resolved, then there would be some cooling," he noted after the Czech initiative meeting.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that the executive branch can hardly meddle in legal affairs.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local one in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era to have recourse to a higher court.
You can then apply for release on bail and wait for your sentence on release.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner spoke in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the High Court then it will be possible to obtain pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to give the convicts "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the utmost interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down for many years with India.
The Indians admit it too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of his partner he pointed out that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We truly consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he got the promise from the Indian side to take care of the thing.
"I've gotten relatively many promises," he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But it is not interested in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers on oceans and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exposure and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and the enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metallic minerals and other mineral matter, but also living organisms unknown until now that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest bottom of the mainland
Coastal states have begun to lend interest to submarine territory.
According to the OSN convention that is, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
That has under the Convention an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In a nutshell, continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles,” Mikulka explains.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by very extensive technical-scientific documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The committee has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
Australia’s recent success in expanding its marine holdings has had a worldwide echo.
But New Zealand has also earned us — the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers so about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bear them in the future from the seabed,as they promise will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area at the bottom of the ocean that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity begins.
Nowadays, no state has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this zone is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
“But the Seabed is not Klondike,” says Director Mikulka, exaggerating, “with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established.”
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If it divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it is almost a submarine replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Macedonian division, Rober Sandev, brings a find to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the Golem's awakening.
German Special Units were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in the release of the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is coming to us about the circumstances surrounding the release of the 11 European hostages.
The rescue operation, as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, involved special German units.
In addition to the army specialists, the GSG9 units, the Federal Avian Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present on site.
As the spokesman of the ministries said on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages by fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there fortunately," said a spokesman for the interior ministry.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers in southern Egypt on September 19: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the liberated have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not elaborate on the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin as to when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units are expected to fly with an Airbus of the military air force and arrive on Tuesday in Germany.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The first chamber of the US Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down.
With 206 votes against 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite appeals from US President George W. Bush and prominent politicians from both parties, there had been no majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been stemmed.
In a dramatic move, supporters desperately tried to persuade critics from the $700 billion hefty package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, incited MPs to consensus, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the vote was in progress the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors’ concerns was that the state bailout package could fail.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of bankruptcy, collapsed again.
Experts now expect more serious turmoil in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters register increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased significantly - for the winter season even by more than 30%.
Despite weak economic views, the Germans' desire to travel, according to an investigation, remains firm.
On bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, as reported Monday in Berlin the German tourism association DRV.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK, there are increased booking quotas even for the autumn months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would have amounted to about 11%, the DRV said.
The GfK analyses the booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies on a monthly basis and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Also included would be travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak price of the dollar, travel to the United States would be particularly required, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany, would also be particularly popular with Germans.
Especially all-inclusive travel has a high price tag, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individually organized holiday."
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for reservations made well in advance or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the previous year there would again be a surplus in turnover - although according to a further study the number of Germans who embarked on a trip,compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, one-liter beer from mugs and branded Dirndln vip.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually have not much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a custom made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing we have in common: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, photographers already throw themselves against us and take pictures to fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends
The Dirndl from two bucks seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist from Wiesn and a resident actually north of the equator of white sausages, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress to this day is still within limits.
But once you get to the Theresienwiese, it’s nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only the apron of my Dirndl collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A monk remarks that I would have tied the apron wrongly: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are engaged, behind a widow."
I sneak in and fix the bow from the back to the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which he heads "To drink to get dressed!" and stretch his naked butt against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a dragged "ooooo"..
This tells me, after he got rid of his jar of beer from a liter drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a garbage can.
Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 p.m., the sanitaries walk in packs on the square of the feast, who have to take care of the poor beoni.
Nurses appear each time in packs – always 4 at a time drag a stretcher covered with a tent in a tent.
This works like most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Whoever is lying under the curtain in this blood alcohol coffin, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the sanitaries yells at me and disappears into the trap.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died shortly thereafter.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of inattentive driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is widening its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the magnitude of the undertaking of what was the westernmost passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a laggard to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominating forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station, too.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly gone into disarray, largely surpassed by history.
But nowadays, this railway outlet to Anatolia and all points to the east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's increasingly larger diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new commitment policy.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeper car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning – about ten and a half hours later – after a jolt race along the tracks that produced the old-world rhythms of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital – proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by built-up shopping malls and power bakeries, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early-morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Full, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
“The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for either of them.
It must be both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want where to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost everyone with whom I have spoken here has recited from memory: the ties of the EU not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another blank night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe’s Middle Eastern ambitions can now largely be in Turkey’s hands.
And while I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At that time, at least, there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent to make demands on this fascinating country.
Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, September 11) had been in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21s, but by the time Proteus sang their final in 1979, many of us were in our twenties — we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changing) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to face everything that the music presented to do, both madrigals and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often we were told by Tod to “let the music speak for itself.”
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever the musical standard was, it was making it more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a conductor as a knight, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I’ve watched more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been at odds with one of them – and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply “run around the world one or two well-known workhorses.”
He will be missed by so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a bachelor's degree in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, we don’t know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second round for Honda's bestsellers
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
A refined mechanics must be added to all this, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before going on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, almost one million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those in charge of the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over the course of a year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the managers of the company expect to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door, compact hybrid – 4.37 meters long – of which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and according to the estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of the Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company’s presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, it also expands the habitable interior.
This advantage stems on the one hand from the introduction of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with a double backrest – rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measures of the 1.4 engine version, and that the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in terms of accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of commercialization, this small model will be offered in models with petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower fuel consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize the mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model offers a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions equal to about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horsepower, there are now 100 horsepower available.
The Jazz 1.4 at 100 horsepower achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, for example, taking the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to Nissan’s safety shield.
But the most important thing is bee compound eyes, able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, the engineers developed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
This mechanism detects obstacles in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
“As soon as it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at a right angle or greater to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect up or down, nor even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can turn and not exploiting endless directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of the previous maneuvers, for this it can work without interruptions and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even mega.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to get the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles present in the route.
Trembling before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from committing to junk mortgages in banks with dubious insolvency, they have created a fun and instructive game for users of the network: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "bad credit hotel"...or trouble.
The grim aspect of this arrangement and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce you to think not once, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It’s more of a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a song room inside the hotel.
It's still something, because to buy a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a 21% stake in the Company, news received following a sharp decline in its shares on the Stock Exchange.
A week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum equal to three billion dollars.
The established price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars to title, or a percentage inferior to its current course of 28%.
At around 5 p.m., however, Morgan Stanley fell 6.79% to $23.07.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to differentiate its shares by passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than previously assumed.
The modalities defined Monday also show that in recent days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum equal to 8.5 billion dollars.
A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: “We thought that our shareholding would be composed exclusively of ordinary shares.
But considering the current state of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their book value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into ordinary shares in one year if, during a given period, the latter are exchanged more than 50% below the conversion price set, i.e. around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital contributed by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" eased its balance sheet from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put a strain on the group, which has seen the value of its shares halve while the cost of insurance against risks has soared.
The cost rebounded on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other “surviving” Wall Street investment bank after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had collected $15 billion, in part from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
To establish a republic on the basis of socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
According to the official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, on a basis of 80% votes.
According to these results, the "no" votes were 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank ballots.
For the draft constitution to be adopted, it would have to get half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polls and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed victory in his draft constitution on Sunday and Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously," he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place calmly according to the electoral observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points designed to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially on the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently on their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-propose his candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the free health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive in the desert for ten days were brought back safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been freed in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently fit, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, around 3:30 p.m., aboard a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to give any interview to the press, to the hospital of Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They are in "good health" and no ransom was paid "to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the safari’s organizing agency.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight, just before dawn.
"There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," the official said, requesting anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We have to admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, of the special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle in which the kidnappers were located and to have killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers are linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a claim immediately denied by the latter.
Letters- The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign focuses.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life is always in the shadows.
Who will speak out to denounce the meager sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are hungry?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the restoration of the castle of Chinon, in the Loire Valley?
To our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that states that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by common agreement.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers from the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage assets, preserve private archives and archaeological sites with four dollars.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be given to history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help by partial nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in trouble in Europe due to the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, also involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the difficulties facing the international financial market for more than a year is that of Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can set a precedent.
Under the decision taken on Sunday night all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank’s share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first and foremost the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week, Fortis’ stocks began with a vertical collapse, and serious signs of the institute’s crisis appeared in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank’s shares fell nearly 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current share prices the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank’s managers this value is not real.
The company’s summit blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday, the title slowly picked up again.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed the bank’s new CEO.
The financial institution has also sought out private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a deserving offer.
The Belgian government had already assured investors that they should not fear losing money.
The bank's customers did not panic, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has autonomous subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers, based on people’s medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a privacy program that the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken coop to the fox," the Washington Post writes, quoting Richard Dick, author of the program, to follow prescriptions for drugs.
Insurance companies make the insurance rate and the amount due in the event of claims dependent on the health status of the potential customer and if they consider the risk too high, they do not take out insurance.
Once upon a time the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was concluded only after the result of the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer's identification code, you can easily get information from pharmacies about which medicines he has bought in the last year and a half and from this the program shows which diseases he suffers and in which health conditions he is.
For example, if you regularly purchase large amounts of cholesterol-lowering products, this means that the level of fat in your blood is practically incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
In the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, the insurer therefore in addition to paper work does not remain much, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the cons is that some medicines are usable for several purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, is valid as a risk increase factor, the first two are not.
For the request and data processing, separate companies have been formed and, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, they ask for the patient's approval.
Now the authorities force them to do so even if they have not imposed fines for negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to drug consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data and, at the same time, the control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control competence to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that connects the forwarding of data with the express approval of the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the hens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Marseilles menu global
India and the European Union to double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade mostly with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit has also been dominated by this theme, in addition to all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will deal first and foremost with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is becoming a major democratic power that should be given more voice in international affairs, but member states have yet to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So we did not insist on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the EU's rotating president, José Manuel Barroso, the Commission's president, and Javier Solana, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade in five years, i.e. increase up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so that air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance because while the EU is India’s top trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU’s partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and urged the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the energy and climate programme, meaning it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global pact should be concluded at the climate conference scheduled for next year and that greenhouse gas production should be reduced by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb rising food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian prime minister will travel to the French capital today where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy in a bilateral meeting.
In Paris it is hoped that to build the Indian nuclear reactors French companies will receive a contract worth 20 billion euros.
According to our news agency, the deal would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary to the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be institutionally present with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The press meeting will follow at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and teenagers, is progressively decreasing.
Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago, has been found.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly the one Steve Fossett was flying on the day it disappeared."
The sheriff said no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was reported dead in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Security (NTSB) said that a team of investigators was dispatched hours after the wreck was spotted, which then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal belongings were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents under the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search was halted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long string of records.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on a balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had travelled the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you don't expect
An out of the box SUV with an original design and well defined by sharp lines, wide surfaces and sharp corners.
It is this, in summary, Glk the latest born among the "compact" offroads of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of freshness in this sector.
Due to its contents outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus, the advertising hype that will accompany the debut of the new car will initiate an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic 3D poster campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-posters, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car escapes from the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, then recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will this formula arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years and that until now, in fact, had never created excessive problems.
Neither had he ever clashed with the opposing fans.
The draw of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia have been added small groups (few units, in reality) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the militants' home cities appear: Saturday night they were removed so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a fanbase of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The FIGC had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominative, so easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium offenses, were denied a ticket and prevented from travelling.
Now the Viminale waits to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police then will take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents attending not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thank goodness.
But now there is fear-emulation, that is, that to those a little more than a hundred and fifty, there should be added others.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say from the Viminale.
So, "eyes well opened especially in view of the match of the National Team on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia, in fact, there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which deals precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the extended arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a really unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks ago director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been quaestor of Trieste where there is a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to praise Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the fact takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to the anthem of Mameli: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me, they are not education...”.
