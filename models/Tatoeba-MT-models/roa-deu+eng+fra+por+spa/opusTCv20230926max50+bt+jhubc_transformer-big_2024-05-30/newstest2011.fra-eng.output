What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new elected members of CSSD at the capital city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the municipal council level with their old and new colleagues of the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argument that was born in recent years at the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected do not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a young man in Prague politics," said Lukas Kaucky, the culturally elected official who tested the "godfather"'s vocabulary.
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"It's the only expression of the ones you're proposing I use."
Otherwise, I don't use the arguing.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-eectoral congress of the ODS, the editorial board chose 6 examples, in priority those that are related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", going to the pastry shop", "beef nerve", "betrayal of the capital" and "engulfing".
Three of the elected representatives agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek refused the test.
"I don't take care of these things at all and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
“I’m currently working on how we’re going to get along in our programs,” he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the above legend, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky said and immediately added: "But I know it from the newspapers."
“I’m going to have to pay for a language course,” he joked.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"This is, I think, going into a company," Plachy is ready to guess that this is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to test candidates there is no slang lexicon in social democracy.
"I've been consulting with colleagues and it turns out that we really don't have anything like that."
"The names are sometimes called abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, which party members call Hulda.
"I used to be called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," says Karel Brezina about the nicknames.
Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Grandpa to the Party members or the less friendly Little Old Man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to using within the party.
It is reported that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in law of baton" recalls it seems that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of doctor of law JUDr. at the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are part of the older generation, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man very rarely has this destiny."
“We also don’t judge healthy young women because they take part in work and give birth to children,” says a sister who takes care in the West African country’s capital, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He edited a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
The case has a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” warned the daily Die Standard about the drawback of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso's neighbour, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprayed on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
Criminals say it was the bad eye.
According to their version the oil that is used for ritual anointings ignited in contact with the woman.
The oil ignited, it seems, when the team wanted to "chase out the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human spirit eaters have always represented a danger,” he says.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia has seen the President himself participate in it as late as last year.
Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that allegedly participated in his death and endeavored by black magic to kill the President as well.
"Shamans from nearby Guinea, who came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal custody of the President, randomly chosen men and women in villages in the Gambia," Amnesty International said in a message.
On the farm, the prisoners had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
Under international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
Bakal's tenant: The stoves are heating up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man walked out the door of the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "baron of coal" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He had under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel," he points to the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed anyway," he explained, angry and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz citizen association, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a gesture of the hand.
"One says this, the other says something else" with frowns.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After New Year's Eve, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect, whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
For this reason Aktualne.cz has decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09:00 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" as your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the topit of the waiting room.
In a split second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere else - claims for repairs, insurance events and so on.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with the new leases in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for new rents has been open to the public since November 18.
“It’s been working for almost a week, so it’s still in the test,” the employee behind the desk responds after a moment of hesitation when the client shows up as a journalist.
The deregulation and former miners' apartments of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and native of the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported quite strongly before the elections and this is now filling the local newspapers.
“Twenty years later, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change me a put...n board in the toilets, relieves in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to the employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they now sign as promised RPG in a special offer.
This is a discount of half the amount of rent that will be received by other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," the employee said at the counter.
And yet RPG offers both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will make the decision.
"This is not about threats but only about informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally," RPG said on its website.
"Here no one will go to court," one of the employees of RPG Byty thinks and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives her reason.
“I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people are waiting," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be at most 7.50 CZK per m2 per month," the screen reads.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a really very low sum 19.66 Czech crowns per m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on rent increases have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices included the architects.
the Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch. Design company.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectural project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has been imagining its mini business kindergarten since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
She employs about 90 people, mostly of child-bearing age, and she cared that women architects and project managers could quickly get back to work.
Along with reduced-time employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the Arch. Design company as part of its social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine work that takes care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who designed this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The kindergarten is financed by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding allocations (up to 2.8 million Czech crowns), they were able to buy equipment and devices and after two years ensure a qualified staff as well as the start-up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project took a year and it was the Economy rating company that helped to apply for staffing.
The care of the children is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children. children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are over three for the most part.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace themselves.
The school operates flexibly according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is a matter of individual care and education, the mini kindergarten curriculum is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children do not only play there but also ensure a quality education - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches we teach English.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of being late to pick up the children at a school far from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
No wonder there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly towards the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi's interiors.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase resembles a dinosaur spine and the balconies resembles open fish mouths.
This is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic shapes, the house has received from the locals the nickname Bone House.
Organic shapes, wild colours, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, a façade reminiscent of scales and curves everywhere present, that is all that is epic for Antoni Gaudí's Art Nouveau.
The front of the house unfolds its dream lines, pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelet and the slats.
The house Battlo which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of an entirely new one but quickly accepted Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-housing house was not conceived by Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
For the facade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of the Casa Battlo house began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Mila and the Park Guell in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the house hot right after its finishing because of its organic shapes "the Bone House".
Others, in view of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, have called it "the house that bails".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the building contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí thought for the house a system unique in its time of central heating, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction directives of the time and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permit to build, knowing, of course, that the data carried on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and asked for changes.
For example, the members of the city council did not like the fact that the pillars of construction were standing on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) the authorization to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the lounges and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate maintenances.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi’s play with light is also impressive, with blue and white glazed tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with skylights.
The two-color set gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which instead absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house which was inscribed in 2005 in the Unesco World Heritage Fund can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits as they found it to be a lucrative business and they expanded the scope of visits to the common areas and attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really not expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the price of admission to other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a bed base: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bedtime, so the mattress and the bed base give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the choice several things are decisive,:weight, height, age, health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which you will place the mattress and the base is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where one does not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warm up" gently.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels at the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
Habit is also decisive in the choice.
Those who spend time abroad, where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel good on a low and hard surface.
"This is how all hockey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
“For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam.”
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore misassumes the 'information' of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You don’t have to be an NHL guy to be able to enjoy lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you will not turn around in the night as after a difficult match.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against squares.
For the choice of the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, which is about 21/34 cm.
A man and woman with a height of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It is convenient in case of a visit.
'However, there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should lay your hands comfortably with your elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Butlers-maids and decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and specializes in schools.
For a double bed each needs its own box spring and mattress, so be careful however during the achat to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the box spring at different heights and this is not achievable on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, from this count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress, you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of bed frame.
The bed base, when the mattress and the bed base are joined like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses ventilated very badly; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this reason, specialists refuse to advertise a lifespan of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything to its but.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the upholstery of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to manufacture coatings with zipper for the whole set, that is to say that after the opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for a single person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a box spring?
Never! Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an ventilation layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For slatted beds with a single position with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are folded in the part of the kidney as well as regularity is possible.
For multi-position mattresses you should not take spring mattresses because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the slats, what is called a shoulder cradle can also be installed.
This is a special connection of the slats that allows the slat to be pressed or even tilted so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have “shoulders as wide as their backs,” this is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by mattress manufacturers who for "males" have started to use a softening area at shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or wafer frames with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and thins the tension.
But of course, beware, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and springboard, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a very simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm which Scandinavians for example prefer.
When lying on one's side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the springboard or the softened area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the early straw and grass mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also for organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"The Bio qualification for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus company.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the birch plant extract so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "warms" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disrupted cellular structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached the first place.
Saving for the mattress and the sommier is not easy.
From time to time, two mattresses may be provided as part of special actions by manufacturers or producers for the price of one mattress.
For example, the company Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
The second one can be taken for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were suffering from the start of enormous load factors.
Tempur softens in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
This is why it is ideal against sleeping pain and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, originally set up to search for cars, can also be used to trace the movement of people and to help in some cases, such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but only another way to decrease the likelihood of another tragedy," said Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I confess that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of someone who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes the "box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear such a thing on him, he will get rid of it.
“And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to deliberately getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can cut like these tracing devices, have already led parents to long waits,” Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is highly questionable.
"If it is a planned abduction, the perpetrator will do everything possible to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
“At the moment, it’s the phone.”
"As soon as the tracing devices are developed, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help during an unprepared assault by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The apparatus may be configured in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it still remains the last position of the person concerned."
"The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and finds himself in the lying position without moving," Cech said.
According to him, the so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special pro-software.
The problem with today's tracing systems is that they are either similar to pendants the size of a matchbox or smaller telephones.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracing device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracing device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracing cars.
It is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a cell phone function that alerts a vehicle to its current position.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could go around the Czech Republic with, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the ropes is two to four years maximum.
The military bought detonator cords from the STV Group for 40 million kroner.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the achat of an enormous amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the pyrotechnicians of the army, which MF DNES has contacted, it appears that even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries or cleaning staff should have an explosives exercise every year.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating ropes.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's reserves could be kept there for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough to have more than 2 m of detonating ropes, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
There is no mention of the lack of laundry.
"And I don't mind if they buy so many detonating cords from us."
“And that’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
"For us the army is a good customer that we strive as traders to satisfy," says STV Group sales director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argues that hundreds of kilometers of detonating cords will be used by the army for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports of only four years of life of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnicians of the police and army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can be up to four years," says one who does not want his name published in view of criticism of the army.
As the life span has passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests, however, are not free and still cost money.
The department's other argument is a rebate for the quantity of 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of the defense ministry's buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of police pyrotechnics that neutralize ammunition from the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifespan.
This was established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexible types of detonating ropes more modern and more reliable.
The Ministry of Defense today has big problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "cheap".
To this day, I benefit from contacts that I have obtained through the contests.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun win the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition.
The winner of last year’s Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
“The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building which he converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Liberec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year there was another one of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise showed up," the number one entrepreneur of last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year contest has served well," adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and being known in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, congratulated me often and, I have to say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
He recommends participation in this competition to all those who are striving to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge to this day that he could not have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met through the contest, I began to maintain business relationships regularly.
According to him, the fame related to the success also had an impact on the employees.
And he's about 70.
“I observe in them above all the loyalty and pride of having engaged in something that has generally been recognized.”
“This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of good work by all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of purpose of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to get the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the contest for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million kroner.
"I can say that the award has not only encouraged me, my employees and increased our self-confidence in fighting the competition," said the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of Farmet's history there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after they began to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success obtained in the contest through the media.
“Not only have our customers started to really get to know the Farmet brand but also the foreign partners who have started to realize that they are collaborating with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not been spent in Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's valuation was based on 2008 and part of 2009 economic results.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"Obviously we have not escaped this situation."
“Revenue fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off,” Zdarsky said.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained beneficial results even if they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
At Farmet, however, they continued uncompromisingly to invest in research and development.
"We built with the endowments a training and research center, strengthened the company's presentation in international trade fairs and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees is rising and so is the number of employees.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that eliminates foolish regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year survey is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The unglorious winner of this year's Absurdity Survey of the Year was the requirement to bring into offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the commercial register, while the grievor could obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
“The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer ask for the trade register extract for insurance payment checks,” said Jana Buranova, a spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Bringing out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must comply with in the Czech Republic and removing those that are absurd is the meaning of this Absurdity of the Year contest.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters showed up, it is at least 4000 this year that brought their vote.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the company, and,this, more and more.
"We may be among the number of documents to be filled out for tax returns at the top places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of conditions for the company, 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first established in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September each year, the last deadline before the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the highest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until last year's last investigation, it is a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by the entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and the professors.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, so among the nominees is for example the obligation that vehicles for the maintenance of highways and highways pay the tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repainted two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts money in the legs of entrepreneurs and for that my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to suppress absurd decrees is not a swordsmanship in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days in advance at the office for the individual business at the place where the business is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the text of the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year—the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training and sporting projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that monitor the impacts of their business on the environment and conduct socially responsible business,” said Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone operator Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of the contest, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the company's competition of the year 2010, organized by the Vodaphone company, companies that did not succeed with a single long-term objective for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be edited.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one case, this concerns people with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic there is no example the Prague pro-software company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a responsible firm in the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old paper mill in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of the employees with health problems, has been awarded the title of Central Bohemian Responsible and third in the region in the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, that has won for having introduced flexible working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, decrease in wages.
The jury awarded her the title also because she buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports a lively activity in the nearby surroundings and cares about the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and our administration have the least impact on the environment,” says Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
the responsible IT company Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
In the last place is, also for its activities, a company of Washing and Cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and recreation," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company of bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition, who had completed the questionnaire attached to the document for registration and sent it back to the organizer by August 15, were automatically enrolled in the Responsible Company category.
Incomplete or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition the Firm of the Year of Vodaphone".
"Independent entries are not possible because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed the local entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubos. G.
The latter had endeavoured to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a request for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He was to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"At the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in the context of a public tender and competition," Plzen Prosecutor Antonie Zelena told the Pravo newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations as the investigation is ongoing.
The police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in the light of so little official information.
Asked by Pravo, Lubomira Cerna, a spokeswoman for the Lands Fund, said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a customer and in no case an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is set up when there are several candidates beneficiaries of law.
"These persons propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to restitution which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of the buyers is put in place and the Lands Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the spokesperson said.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and since he himself is also a beneficiary because having purchased a large number of restitution rights, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably cashing in by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
He was included in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been issued.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the access road to the industrial zone of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked endangering the construction by a blockade of the land.
Households will pay an additional 100 kroner per month for housing.
As of January, households will have to pay a surcharge not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to draw up to 100 kroner a month more than they do now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 kroner per year for apartment households more than currently.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, in particular photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
One can also count an additional hundred crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the larger municipalities that plan the price increase.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 kroner more per month for central heating from January, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 kroner per year.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing a 9 percent increase for water and sanitation in case the city increases the infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the Pragians will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the entire country.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are up 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will for example increase significantly in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January, that is to say at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase it up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very slowly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recurrence are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors encountering cases similar to admissions in hospital children's departments.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to get drunk.”
"The trend is really towards strong alcohols," said Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department at the hospital in Horovice in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to snatch a daddy bottle out of the closet, it's sometimes whiskey, but fernet and vodka prevail."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so not smell it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, also gives him reason.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It is now alcohol in fashion, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of Department Pélikan, seeing drunk children aged thirteen to fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced ten years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times like this.
"She started her career at twelve when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with in addition a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Centre at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was away for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of the parents or their unusual tolerance to the fact that their offspring indulge in drinking that are the main cause of the development of alcoholism in children.
According to specialists, however, we are not talking about addiction, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the word alcoholic we mean a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that is not found in children."
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family back-ground," explained the Head of Department Pélikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistic.
Drunk children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or police, are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, there are three seasonal waves according to Pelikan that can be counted on: Witches' Day, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink out of spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course I experienced at the witches' day an admission of 7 drunk children at once," Pélikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who went home and suffered the next day from "hangover".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they have an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
“They’re just surprised at where they are,” Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the bill to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and hospitalization on an intensive care bed can be up to tens of thousands of crowns.
“Once in a while, I applied this as a way of educating these children by counting how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend all summer on seasonal work to pay for a single evening,” Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regressive managements, which should recover from the parents the expenses related to care, do not treat cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, for which the Ministry of Defense exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of anyone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the course of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were in service with the Czech Army and were in flight.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seater versions of the L-159.
These are currently parked at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the Omnipol firm - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defense, the physical departure of the aircraft from Vodochody is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for the exchange were taken from long-storage aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The two-seaters L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not be without two-seaters since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 cars into two two-seaters.
The military took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to introduce the aircraft in the equipment of some countries of the Alliance.
“In the contract it is clearly stated that the one who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used for the training of pilots from NATO member countries.”
"It is therefore up to the person who is considering how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
the Defence Directorate argued that the exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only used 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen in a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index finger than the ring finger is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have the index finger longer than the ring finger are at a lower risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that relative finger length serves as a simple prostate cancer risk test, especially for men before age 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining it with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a shorter right hand index than the annular one.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the index index longer than the annular the risk however fell to 33 percent, for men before 60 years the decrease in risk reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he was aware of the study but did not believe the relationship between finger length and cancer was "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is in the snow, D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow this Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks there is mostly compact snow, clearing workers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93rd kilometre towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile Club Central (UAMK) told the news
At the 91st kilometre a truck was injured, at the 93rd two heavy trucks collided, the accident injured people.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometre towards Prague.
Two trucks crashed into it.
Drivers should exit just after Brno on the 190th kilometre or go through Brno and then enter the 182nd kilometre in Kyvalka.
A queue of cars of several kilometers formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, lines of cars are created in Prosek, Sterboholska street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the crisis staff of Prague is yet to meet.
The railways and the airport are also experiencing problems.
The Czech Railways has already had to eliminate 7 rapids connections due to snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 in the night until 5 am.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but with increased vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there are starting to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain communication routes in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them you may need to send snow removers and snow cutters.
We can't estimate when they'll be rollable.
On the road to Hodonin prudence is of the rigour in the region of the White Carpathians.
On roads that are, with regard to the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, often with up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall is gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new ‘smart weapon’
The U.S. military has sent a new “smart” weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few meters.
The 25 mm caliber special ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually works as small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when a deadly shower of steel chips falls on it, it can also put it out of action.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends it a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise point of sight, according to which he corrects his aim site and presses on the trigger.
"Let's say you shot at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon charges and fires at the distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located in the office building at Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated Wednesday the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, so far located on the Marienbader square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, huge office complex located on the Lyoner Straße of the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman said that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together 100 other jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices at Astro Park are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
CEO Bernd Wagner said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure.
He says the connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region sparked the joy of the winners yesterday and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global player" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its establishment is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
Management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer vis-à-vis the owner of the building in Marienbader Square.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing such an exceptional place from being vacant for a long time.
"I am hopeful that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Town Hall Square building, used until now by Fujitsu and the neighboring "small vertical" company, as well as the rest of the buildings in Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial spa construction project.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the Town Hall, which aroused much criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that once served as part of parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment rating and advisory firm, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt-based specialist group Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu together with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund, and a year later these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, considers itself the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, with Fujitsu employing far more people in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, moves from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, is home to the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronics and Electrotechnical Industry.
Amazon server eviction - Threats against Mr. Assange
WikiLeaks is having more and more trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may be concealing political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder Mr. Assange is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, the WikiLeaks website is being attacked with ever more force.
The cyber-activist group Wikileaks no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, eminent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely staying in Britain, according to news reports.
"Wikileaks Excluded from Amazon Server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activists behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber-company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “Formidably, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression poses a problem for Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned WikiLeaks from using its servers after the investigation by Sen. Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, The Guardian.
“I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier in light of WikiLeaks’ previous publications of classified information,” he said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of the servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, putting our national security at risk and endangering lives around the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether U.S. or foreign, should help WikiLeaks disseminate the contents of the stolen documents.”
Wikileaks founder Mr Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described Sweden's prosecution of him as plots orchestrated by his detractors.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made against the site.
"Appeals have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of WikiLeaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly reacting to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s adviser said on television, obviously ironically, that Assange should be “killed” and that Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr Assange.
Robert Gibbs, a spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's resignation if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and leaked recently, to engage in espionage activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counter-Terrorism Center, has been appointed responsible for fighting the leaks.
Mr Travers is tasked with putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks.
The White House also has a willingness to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are threatened by WikiLeaks’ revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, that is to say in German the somewhat outdated ice cream maker, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice cream.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window with a spatula, places it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The ice cream maker founded the Ice University in 2003 so that the ice creams coming out of its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice cream are also offered over several days, as well as hands-on sessions in the private ice cream parlor.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others risk simply realizing their ardent desire on the smooth ice.
This time, there were 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of arts education from California, is fond of the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial ice in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and after a few years she wants to get something unique out of this nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream.
Determining not only is the good taste, but also the silky suppleness and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the icing on the cake of the national and, in general, southern superstructure: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a hell of a dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a faucet installed on the machine: a pasteurized white base cream is produced, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately beset with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of time.
One who speaks only of ice cream "made from natural ingredients", has perhaps nevertheless used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example, guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only you have to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will eat nothing but ice pellets.
Some modifications of the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one acquires in the fruit or confectionery shelf of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice cream made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and forms, when added to cocoa powder, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, it is not absolutely better.
Ice cream with hazelnuts does not necessarily have the taste of walnuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice cream, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly detects the taste of an ice cream," says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (winners use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
The production of ice no longer requires, as in the past, so much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic base mass making machine that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the mixture of ice available is simultaneously beaten to make it creamy and brought back to negative temperatures.
In spite of all automations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo smears fruit puree from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Luciano believes that "such an incident may occur in each class: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiments with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has correlated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now being made by the Testbiotech expert group which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
“This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have been doing a lot of research,” Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
Some reports say that the chairman of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, as well as other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby group.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of EFSA's test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest, according to Mr. Then's criticism.
The provisions drawn up correspond, by paragraphs, to the positions of the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the trade mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities based in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period, changing sides.
Not long ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions both from the German Federal Environment Agency and from MEPs.
However, EFSA does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum for experts from, among others, the fields of science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being paid by a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding tests on animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the incidences of genetically modified maize are causing the field," says Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" Then asked in an accusatory tone.
This is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry controls safety research."
The Trace of Stone
Uli Gsell got it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart train station with her tube on her back.
There was a manifesto.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, excavators had come and started to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of the Stuttgart central station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the cessation of construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He obtained some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claimed that by cutting it with a saw, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest located near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the landfill,” he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was the subject of insults and threats when newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing an average of 80 kilos with a value between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half are still crammed into the forest, the rest have long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could get into the trunk and trailers.
These scandal stones of Stuttgart have long since been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
“It would not have been that political component.”
He gets into his all-terrain car, tours his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law and dropped out of law school. Later, he began studying biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a careerist.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He is amassing treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's holding back.
Artfully carved sandstones are laid on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a bunch of fingers: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the stand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt coming from the police prefecture, the reddish granite coming from the cathedral of St. Blasian, the tuff coming from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was torn apart."
He didn't get rich, let alone very rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon he will be heading to Cologne.
There are also stones to be saved.
Struggle of talents to conquer high potentials
The counter has a strong turnout.
16 students scramble to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and white food.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a sort of idea contest, they have to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, get to know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-in-hand in the competition to find better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most gifted graduates in the amphitheaters as much as possible before they enter the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talents as part of practical projects and retain them.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group pampers talent.
A young lady from the staff department shares pens, candy and cards bearing the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talents; she shows them the paths to access the group's premises.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both parties: "Students get in touch with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we seek to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a number of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and above all court the highly skilled workforce.
Graduates from engineering fields are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions were vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the gap for engineer positions will widen further.
Roman Dykta goes talent hunting on behalf of KPMG, an auditing, accounting and consulting firm.
He organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper-rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the U.S. this way.
Participants can accessorily visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who is to participate decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used for the quest for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
“We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race.”
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter who is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
“Until now, we have been in touch with everyone who took part in a similar action last year.”
“Some of them are about to complete their studies and want to address their requests to our company soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct on-campus trimming, small and medium-sized enterprises do so in a very traditional way by participating in trade fairs where they engage in brainstorming.
"We are trying to reach graduates by attending trade shows."
“For example, at the solar technology fair,” says Sitha Stübe, human resources director at Solarworld, a photovoltaic panel manufacturer.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are being tendered on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says.
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, e.g. the University of Freiburg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to carry out professional internships or write his/her final study project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are advertised among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often a large group cannot do that," said Stübe, chief of staff.
Money has long no longer played a leading role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are other determinants.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The institute is an annual honorary chart of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees about their satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
The Chief of Staff, Ms. Stübe, hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among jobseekers.
“I think candidates rely mostly on external assessments of a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, first and foremost, taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, that is, the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
“Satisfied employees are the best messengers.”
When you treat your employees well and they identify with the company, they themselves advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” Kriegler said.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, in the years to come.
The Washington government issued an equivalent ban and thus permanently cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which exploded in April, will remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of the accident, which claimed the lives of 11 employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this industry, had indicated that he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution want to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign countries for oil supplies.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in golf has not, to date, been definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces multibillion-dollar claims, is at the center of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze decreed after the rig exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would remove them from the lucrative tax niches of the gas and oil groups.
Players in this sector are now publicly warning that the feed flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector," according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the audit firm BDO, before the drilling ban pronounced Wednesday.
In fact, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been deferred until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water that flows into the rivers is brown oiled; it exudes a smell similar to that that exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live off theft, corruption, and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
“Don’t get exhausted,” the environmental activist tells reporters to calm them down: “You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man immersed in muddy water to his chest, as well as the fat trail that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the sparkle of rainbow-colored water.
We cannot see that the basement is full of brown sheets of crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom recounts that she used to collect whole buckets of shrimp here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil spilled from an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the small neighboring town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the ravages is obvious as you walk through the mangrove swamps crossed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits a silky brown water, and anyone who plunges his hand into it removes it completely covered with oil.
The roots of mangroves emerge from the ground like liquorice sticks. The isolated palm trees sadly let their palms hang.
We look in vain for the clouds of birds, as we usually find them in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence descends on this paradise of yesteryear that resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is a war on the environment," Mr. Celestine Akpobari said in a sad air: "Our lives are characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. it was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable for this group.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel beams like bizarre sculptures: The heads of drill holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most are gnawed by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to the experts estimates, more than two billion liters have been poured into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that flowed into the sea during the crash of the super-oiler “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and siphoning of oil pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, while environmentalists consider drillhead explosions and perforated oil pipelines to be the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner criticized Shell Group for applying substantially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipeline failures is “even much higher than others”.
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of mudflats and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with mudflats up to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be spotted: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the pipe, kerosene droplets fall and diesel is finally obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre Diesel drums daily: "It makes us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
The people of the Delta are taking advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents per liter of diesel: because they get their raw material for free.
This is offered by the "protectors" who are putting the network of oil pipelines in drilling all over the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million liters of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta.
Only an entirely insignificant portion of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military members, load the lion’s share into tankers and sell it to the global market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries.”
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni's relations with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was only a matter of withdrawing from the group. "perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove to be better."
Michael is getting nervous.
“It’s high time you went out,” announces the rugged oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to take advantage of the raw material like all Nigerians.
"In every way, this damn thing has brought our country down very low," Akpori said.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
By examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to “catastrophic reactor failure.”
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had clearly had more luck so far: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian aviation safety authority found that the jets of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and it warns against a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks at the connection of the oil pipe, according to a statement published Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors".
This includes Rolls-Royce-made jets equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Quantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4, is among them.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British reactor manufacturer.
She has filed a lawsuit with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas' director, Alan Joyce, said his company would seek damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts came apart and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the ignition of oil that causes the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety-related tests will be carried out on the superjumbos which are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue is considered important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the Quantas airline had grounded its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily shut down three of its eleven A380s.
As a precautionary measure, Lufthansa replaced an A380 jet.
The two-story aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
The snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is chilling Germany: By freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered in snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the staff of the winter service worked permanently, but they were unable to overcome the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office of Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow piles on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
This is why the Weather Alert Central Meteomedia announced the purple alert level has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, this is the highest level.
In places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stranded there at night.
Even in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic interruption and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, severe disturbances in rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, fallen trees on the railway tracks, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the train’s 165 passengers with blankets, food and drinks.
Winds of snow swept the roads.
Snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at major German airports.
According to a spokesperson for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service ensures a permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers stuck at the airport, although only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers present on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until early in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car barreled on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists are announcing good news: The snow will still be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring in up to 500 million Euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group’s headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, quoting a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to lease them again later."
This is how Germany’s largest financial institution has already given up its seat, shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the Twin Towers for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
According to some indications, the energy optimization transformations have amounted to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", at about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the properties will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the buried miners who were declared dead following several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the security situation in the sinking well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinking well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue crews were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that the minors no longer had any chance of surviving.
So far, the bodies have not been recovered.
Today, relatives and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth in the south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photographs and personal belongings, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were put at half-mast in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the memorial party that New Zealand had hoped that the miners would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose Zen son was buried in the pits said he cannot resign himself to accepting the death of his son until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Miners of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion on November 19.
Rescuers have begun extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the scorching temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter movie an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre with his film, "Walhalla Rising", the epic of the fighter.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot “Walhalla Rising”?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for a bloody action, precisely because our hero will wait for those without brutal assassination methods.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind man does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, at the turn of one or two sentences some horrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and we feast on the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that forms the backdrop of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
This would be ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travellings.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy related to the fierce and stylish drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the art and trial cinema.
Most fans of art cinema must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and to the intestines.
Action movie lovers die of boredom, when the blind man embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" has not found any film distributors in Germany and exists only in the DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not about dialogues in this film, nor about coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The spectator cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with chilly images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully beside the blind man, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
Most of all, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by transforming himself into a warrior, is perhaps the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, only for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, whose purpose is annoyance, enthusiasm and wonder.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new information regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, much less to submit to the controls of the agency.
On the night of September 5-6, 2007 around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest nearby town is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in the IAEA documents, because it refers to the reactor that Syria has apparently built with the help of North Korea in parallelepiped stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component prior to the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the interior of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, little more information is available than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery thickens more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little clue that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of an "alleged reactor", even though they regard the CIA's presentation as "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he ensures he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior U.N. diplomat gave only a laconic answer in the summer when he said the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions."
The Syrians certainly hastily removed the rubble from the “unused military building” and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of human-produced uranium in al-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial vendors from one Member State showing the moment directly following the attack, which appear to be more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, possibly Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis, calling it implausible.
Since that time, Damascus has refused any discussion on this, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection at the al-Kibar site and denies access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains obstinately silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
Thus, the investigation into this case has been going on for a long time since June 2008 without a result being achieved and it "is increasingly turning into a serious credibility problem for the Agency", as a high-ranking Western diplomat serving at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna acknowledges, ultimately it is a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-ban treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated which facilities are involved, what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also from the names of the neighboring towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located at or directly adjacent to a military base, which is exactly why Syria is denying IAEA inspectors access to all three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it was intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that drew the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could “be used for fuel production.”
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are indispensable to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible hypotheses regarding the following fundamental questions: where should uranium have come from and where would have been separated later the plutonium needed to make the bomb.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide valuable traces, was stored at all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with dirt have disappeared, no one will have information on where the rubble will be stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked them to the reactor in question.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria undertook groundwork at the three suspicious sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to those sites.
It may have been a coincidence, but it did not help to dispel suspicion.
It is said in the diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for the inspections to be carried out, which would allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows the great interest of the inspectors in this matter.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported on the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been talking for a few months about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means that the Atomic Agency has to implement.
The IAEA director, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there do not want to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as this diplomat who gives to reflect: "Would it be useful, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
It’s been bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer directorial debut.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a Bosnian woman and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing else is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women’s federations immediately protested, and in response some of the filming sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization sent a letter to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet with the actress.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she proposed to these women to have a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined the offer.
“The meeting must be held in Bosnia,” says Hasecic.
There have been no love affairs in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says a lot about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic’s organization subsequently recommended that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights withdraw her goodwill ambassadorship to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted Sarajevo filming permission after some hesitation, but it is unclear why it did not come later despite this authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of efforts that she became aware of the Yugoslav conflict, she maintains that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all stakeholders to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Internet. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other long before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is a big difference from the version of "a rape victim falls in love with her executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, Jolie said, is "unfair and based on erroneous information".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's go!
Tonight, all is well with the Irish again.
No trace of consternation.
That’s why the local team over-dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy against the backdrop of loud music, they wag their feet.
Baileyu-Pub of Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because the players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong". The winner takes 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend the world beer-pong championship in Las Vegas in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the thrilling question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his plans. In January, he will lead interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
"The homeland is so far away and I have no job there."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the bleak prospects at home, two of Tanner's three sisters have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, her brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research say that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts come true, it will be an emigration stream comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes all the place.
The economic crisis, however, mainly affects well-trained young Irish, who have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
Job loss and social decay seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's excess money.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes extensively the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is adrift."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the opportunity, goes away and so does our country for a whole generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a darker future as the government throws dust at the eyes and offers no prospects for young people.
“They are cutting minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old said.
She sees her classmates clinging from one unpaid internship to another.
She says her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" that offers comprehensive support on the theme "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," he said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a hassle, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hannover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, in order to complete the repayment of the loan contracted to build his home in the homeland.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore."
He bursts into an embarrassed laugh as he crosses the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-groomed front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house jointly with his sister for a sum of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by the credit.
“These were moments of insanity, no doubt, the money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid that everything will fall apart because of the credit?
O'Donovan thought for a moment, sipped some hot tea and said, "I don't have children to care for and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The building engineer does not like the laments he often hears lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island," he said.
“Working for a while abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe that’s what made us feel Irish at first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
“He was back after seven years and in Ireland life just kept going.”
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leaving the future and discovering how life goes elsewhere.
He already has a few years of work in London, which is why life doesn't have to be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him very much in recent days: the party to organize on the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He fears it might turn into a farewell night.
“Just not a lot of emotions,” he says while sipping a long sip of beer.
“Goodbye, that sounds disturbing.”
"Let's call it a farewell evening, all relaxed, gathering a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it monitors changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the fairly sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, lowering the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way their country's democracy was functioning in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase over 25% in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34 per cent said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45 per cent in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply from 2003 (respectively 17 per cent and 24 per cent).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this has held up during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have only experienced a brief recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, to 32 percent.)
But mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has worsened.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say they or a loved one has been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their countries developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even though their leftist president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the disaster-stricken and fear-ridden country.
There were ballot boxes and a new ballot, ballot papers scattered in the gutters, looted polling stations and intimidation.
The polling stations were open late at night.
Many Hatians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, were wandering around the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
Nonetheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event "a fairly good election in many respects."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have cautiously stated that they “do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, have necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is expected in January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr Célestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reaches the second round.
With a raging cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there were fears that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so due to disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, enjoyed a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rating by 20 points to more than 50 percent, her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms. Fernández’s visibly grieving choice whether or not to abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confusing.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
The Fernández government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plunged into disarray following Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement rallied to Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian punched one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to fight,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more leeway to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage demands see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which forged official inflation statistics.
Can Ms Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by Argentina's high global agricultural export prices.
But inflation eroded the growth boost following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms. Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernandez seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; which sounds like a prelude to the remediation of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether Ms. Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If it does, it needs to gain support from the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is widely advocated.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have ebbed back.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband’s policies.
Half an hour for China
Taiwanese voters are oriented towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters ran on Nov. 27, accounting for 70 percent of eligible voters, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered an overall assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings about the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has leaned towards Taiwan’s complete independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including bullying campaign trucks and mass rally flags with girls dancing in minimal outfits.
An attempted compulsory murder mystery was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Either way, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking how absent the question of the mainland itself was.
Instead, the candidates flipped with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stoking anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new realization that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
One can expect that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to deceive Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, it would also like to see political integration; but let’s start from the beginning.
It is best to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favor of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Ms. Tsai, and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said the PDP candidates would have gotten better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were low; despite dizzying economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesperson for the KMT said its cabinet and local branches would be revamped.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Award nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to take note of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of this year's Grammy Awards with a major nomination in the "best new artist" category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album Esperanza, the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but it is consistent with the Grammy Award rules that an artist should not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk, and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line in Spalding compared to the flashy success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest jazz equivalent to this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Awards voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a spin on a refreshing thrill of a recording that was a top favorite last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite with the hoarse voice of New Orleans and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the category of contemporary jazz; which is also strongly inclined towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Wild Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, familiar with steampunk, has earned some well-deserved accolades in the Big Ensemble category; competing with Billy Childs' rich chamber-jazz Ensemble and eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose live byte album "Pathways" was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as a band leader.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
Classical nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
Top of the nominations are "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Nominees with ties to Southern California include Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman’s Madolin Concerto is also vying for an award.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for Classic Producer of the Year features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphonies <0x23>3 and <0x23>4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; and "Sacrifice and Orquid" of the Castrati.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg's "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of the Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Mari-Orchester Berlin; The Enchanted Wanderer's "The Enchanted Sulder" of the Rodion Shchedrin's Orchestra.
Composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute work is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles-based composer said he was writing the 15-minute piece especially for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
“I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a lot of scales and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominated vocalists-soloists; these are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots: My Life, My Song".
The project of the Temecula Mosque wins the approval of the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public, often passionate, testimony.
Critics attacked the project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
“A lot of good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha’is, you mention it,” said Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of that, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight, with most people voting for or against the center, with speaking time roughly equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no America anymore,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of the order of 135 families has co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and stand 43 feet tall.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the city council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or arsenic."
“That’s why it’s very particular, even though it’s far from a truly ‘foreign’ life form,” said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday’s online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers have found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“We are wondering what is still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements, which we deem absolutely necessary for life, may not be set," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a chance discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances might be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms have a hard time distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and, somehow, gums out the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar said.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
Arsenic was more common early in Earth's existence, she says; so researchers hypothesized that early life might have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen show dogs were found in Compton
The other two show dogs on four stolen from the outside of a motel in Bellflower have been found, Los Angeles County Sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke Corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday night, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told Reuters.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore says.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore declined to say precisely where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and under what circumstances they were discovered.
"An investigation is underway."
“We don’t want to say it,” Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The dogs' owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached to provide a comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a County Animal Shelter located in Downey.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of Long Beach's "AKC/Eukanuba" national championship, where they planned to introduce Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly month-long canine exhibition tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with the thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a bit, so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van's theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is unclear whether a prize was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially praised the “pre-packaged” plan by creditors that would wipe out about $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and television shows.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to get back afloat under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be a lightweight studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the outset.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase enters into a $500 million credit facility to fund MGM’s new operations and productions.
It is currently being licensed by the investment bank, which itself runs up to $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it could not afford to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the $2 billion more their creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreement and internal debate, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exits bankruptcy in the following weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already secured $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which raised $375,000 a month for their business leadership services, will receive a “success bonus” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch MGM’s production, which has released only one film this year, and to put together an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released starting in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio has to sign a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 percent of MGM’s debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where it is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gifts budget in balance
Although the top candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a major break in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jump ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gifts budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors — Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us and BJ’s Wholesale Club — to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known of their kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offerings.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us unless otherwise noted.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based games like Simon Says and can do lunar dancing thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel locking.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and older), with a backpack filled with quiz game cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with an auto-correction and a valve binder.
If you are suspicious when your child is holding your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
VTech’s Mobigo ($60, for ages 3-8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games don’t educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for ages 3-12), it’s the first major overhaul of the Leapster range, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books, and comes with an SD card input that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks in line before time runs out, this is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based solely on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Club Penguin pet online, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 year olds) that includes a coin marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest button battery micro-robots.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours has withstood a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in our dog’s mouth.
Bringing a softer side to law enforcement in China
Tang Shenbin walked a city square like an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve loads, issuing low voice orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan – imposing law enforcement officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and propensity for violence – to convey a certain impression to a set of viewers.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be sharp!"
Show them, he said, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four girls, having barely spent their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and trousers, froze at the watch.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the ruler.
Four neat hats perfectly perched on top of hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
“Personally, I think they have an average appearance,” Tang said, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
Guangdong province has traded the gray-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the peddler packed his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its urban street police with 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, shape and young age.
The idea is to give the rough police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have a hard time drawing attention to China’s underground urban brigade.
And for good reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media portrays the news as a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat to death an observer after he used his cell phone to film them scattering a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, outlines how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon peddler was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available for download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
“Chengguan marked the government,” China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after yet another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, questioned whether the women had real tasks or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful figure and “the five facial features in the right order.”
They must be above average height, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
Officers said the work was too physically painful for women over the age of 25.
“It’s their image that’s important,” a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; it is about size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: “In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city district management office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job postings for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement relating to the order of facial features.
Whether it means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, disabled or disfigured people should not apply.
“We can’t let a lame person or a hump come and serve here,” Zheng said.
"It wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheekbones with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn’t consider highlighting her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?" she asked disappointedly.
Xu Yang, his colleague at the dimples, 21, says: “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They are not opposed to their mandate being limited, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply chasing salespeople into the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before taking the run.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
“We’ve already told you several times!” said Ms. Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle bike cart.
Officers describe their duties as monotonous rather than arduous.
“It’s pretty much the same thing every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' assets.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that Chengguan’s agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and agents of the Chengguan were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
Calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted at the scandal.
A 15-minute brace followed before the police, with their sinister faces, elbowed their way to their vehicle and set off at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 and over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not formed in order to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case related to a former campaign assistant and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the wife's husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his affair made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Mr. Ensign’s office said he was “very happy” with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator may still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he had no intention of maintaining any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a colleague of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole for one year.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the so-called ban on lobbying's revolving door.
“There appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and a substantial violation of revolving door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-level setbacks received by its Public Integrity Section, including last year's decision to drop prosecution of former Senator Steven D.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the director general of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's senior lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call on Monday from a Justice Department prosecutor and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the ministry was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, “had acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
“I’m not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except to say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign’s $96,000 payment by his parents in the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "hammering" the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transportation Secretary to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth-ranking Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department's lead and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue her hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were tapping away in the rows of the courtroom.
They were sending every minute reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case trial and children tied to their bed in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines appeal arguments that could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use of Twitter by journalists - has created a "circus atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instant with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could prompt appeals judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
“I have experienced it in this trial; I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms is undermining the human rights to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, counsel for Mr. Hayes, chief counsel.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior State Court, laconically dismissed the claims in last week’s judgment, saying the media were “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the issue.
Appeals courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that the appeals courts seized to review Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the media of courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
“There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media” in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue says some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes was allegedly harmed when Blue J. refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of crime scenes during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and that he abusively pressured for a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was being discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to stoke the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily rush of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "did not resemble anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally."
Their focus on Twitter system coverage is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the claim that snapshots were more incendiary than slower releases was a Luddite view that would impoverish the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often drawn to arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they make reference to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
“This affair,” they wrote, “represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can civility bring divisions closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a foretaste of genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the swift return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the big issues that need to be addressed during the “lame duck” session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences of the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the committee on the president’s deficit was just as civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; but which, however, still divides the members.
This is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of mutual trial and testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That's why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxation, spending, health care or rights, both sides stay miles apart.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions and then fade away.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda for the “lame duck” session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting in the White House, more optimism hangs over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the “lame duck”, with the ratification of the “New START” pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "blade duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that have to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
“I consider most of what’s going on between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected representatives of the group; this suggests that there is little motive or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care; followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would still be an optimistic point of view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes part of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the U.S. embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by WikiLeaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was drafted while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has been little evidence of clean-up since then.
Lukhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have consistently denied corruption charges over the years; and he has won several defamation lawsuits on those charges.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s thrown away, it’s just anything.”
Russians overwhelmingly believe their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be to diplomats of a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it “dysfunctional” and claim that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government, according to the embassy note.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term used in the criminal world/mafia that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt detectives are at the lowest level."
“This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report says the FSB is brewing money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, “explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law.”
“This is why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high.”
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy note sends reports of men carrying suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev is dependent on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's think tank Indem, in a recent interview.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"He's not part of a political class because he doesn't exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the cost of corruption in Russia as a whole is more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from the least to the most corrupt).
Disclosure of the note from the US embassy, which was only carried out yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the Moscow failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the remarks that U.S. diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is that this is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, as opposed to ethics.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor quality decrepit concrete walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School referred to the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, handed down its first sentence against a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as “Duch,” to 35 years in prison.
In the face of these developments, anxiety has increased among Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their desire to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within families."
Under the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-United government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have sunk into the black misery common to rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down arms, they are unskilled farmers at low grade and record.
“These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They are soaked in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime.”
“They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for our own needs.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also caused concern here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court's mandate is to try senior officials and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but it did not say whether it was pursuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the rule of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers were reportedly killed.
Recently, on a torrid evening, Im Chaem was returning from work to the field located near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
“Reconciliation in Khmer terms is reconnecting the broken pieces,” he said.
“We have to put these pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, Composed of 75 Pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbooks, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, Anlong Veng's youth know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
“They are wary because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual, and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, overwhelmed by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside mobile phone seller, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot’s last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key component of nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was leaked in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who raised the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“It proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the deal a "very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said.
“It’s our product... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Meticulous coordination and organization have been put in place to build trust," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a senior official at the Department of Energy who specializes in reducing the global threat.
According to estimates from the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Center, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remain essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government has raised no objection to CIA flights
The government has raised no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, which add that the first Vice President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign aircraft that crossed Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting was held between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Zapatero government offside" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken by surprise," Aguirre said in a cable.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, told the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had limited capacity to influence".
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González communicated to the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than for the declassified information of CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba commented to him that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a rhetorical enflam".
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action in this case.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the US government,” she said.
The parricide who went to confession complained in the network of the "overwhelming" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Galician terror"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two were from Noia, the village of La Coruña where she came from.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his love life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they split up, we found out she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him have a DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elect was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the contents of his communications, it is understood that their idyll has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008 she found herself in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset that I came here to work."
"When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send the child to you."
Ella complains: “If he doesn’t like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I’ll take him when I get home,” she alleges.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up at a workstation so I don't lose it".
She explained that if all went well, she would have taken her eldest with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother," he said.
In July, there is another post.
When she hits him, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly murdered on the 10th, died.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Mallorca.
"He'll be there a few hours in the summer and I'll save some money for the babysitter."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
“Alberto says he sent you I don’t know what videos to the email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit.”
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money".
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the now-locked MySpace universe, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
"Terror à la galicienne (epigraphe) ".
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything had happened because she hadn’t told him that she was a single mother.
Monica entered yesterday the provincial penitentiary of Palma, coming from the center of judicial detainees of Menorca.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "nor did she have any intention of harming the minor."
She had previously confessed to having drowned Caesar in the bathtub and left his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People's Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections normally doubles that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the autonomous elections of 2006, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC got 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired by a diversion of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this formation have calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four MPs (it has now 10) and PSC would not lose 25 more MPs (it would not lose 10).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - it has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that handles the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the nationalists and the popular ones agree that the PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority nor the opportunity to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful for this formation to lose its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
The popular have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerien detained by agents of the General Information Commissariat of the Police of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, among which "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let's cause the last death) of 106 people.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda's international counterfeiting apparatus has been "weakened" and "therefore, its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy so that its “combatants” could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why in the investigations participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days of similar blows to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (detained the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand we held another one, with the capture of the pakista and Ahmadinejad.
They were the ones who led from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - was mainly stealing tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found linking detainees in Catalonia to the Bombay bombing, although the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after by the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized a large amount of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which boil down to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of adventures philo-sovereignist desire as is the complicity of the economic leadership that is the nationalist half.
The president of the popular Catalans arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the vote of the investiture.
From a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an investiture “it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and independentist discourses”, and the economic complicity – similar to that of the Basque Country – that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make thin the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the inauguration of Mas will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible while working there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the person responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect the criminal activities of the night nurse in time, the great threat to La Caritat is now taking the form of a large compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - who he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday this situation and mentioned that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only an indication of recklessness on the part of any other person than the accused".
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused her death by injecting her an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the staff of the center to medicines.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to relieve the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But lab tests will clarify whether Vila is not lying by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
La Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to yesterday’s threat from Trichet that warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react”.
The differentials of the peripherals closed to force and the shares of the European banks suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by closes of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose the fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded the finalization of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and keep the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond-buying program will continue and that there will even be a signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will overturn the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
As well as during their meeting in May in which they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only $500 million at 5.28% compared to $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The figures are estimated to be 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even though Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the numbers are assumable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's anthem of joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The dual Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish stock exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was swift and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it will resolve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity we don’t need, the Treasury has more than $40,000 million in liquidity available, three times as much as in March, at very expensive types and they cut off access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "besides being, appearing."
Courage, we can get away with it!
The president of Eulen will challenge the advice of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers him "lawless", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their litigation for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company for companies does not appear to be willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the boards of directors of El Enebro.
He was excluded from its board of directors by five of its seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the meeting of shareholders of January 18 this year whose challenge is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has again opened the thunderbox within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate appeal from the plaintiffs to his five sons to try, through a procedural wit, by clearly defrauding the Law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18," according to his official spokeses.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly takes place, to be challenged on the grounds that it is "zero by right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a wealthy company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group nevertheless requests the usufruct of 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge after the hearing on the application for challenge for which there is not yet a designated date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill as driver of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 we are talking about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines from manufacturing plants around the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant has allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians on their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull cars except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can move from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this madness of technological refinement is the $40 million that each Formula One team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered top secret.
The staff for this duty is 580 people, including two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula One, without a doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and whose notoriety is null.
The factory’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says five years ago it could be said that R&D progress in the case of racing cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to install 20 clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain Vice President Helena Herrero cited the redesigned store on Barcelona’s Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years as an example.
The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openers were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-leading pilot program that solves potential issues with HP’s IT equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war of liabilities.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be partially offset by increments in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million particular customers in three years, its task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a path to explore for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011, which will last for three years.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank - its great task to be accomplished, because until now this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the private customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the wager on productivity, or what is the same thing, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as the objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its master plan Optima, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more year.
Customers who miss out on savings funds will be his main focus.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking affair, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war on liabilities - which penalizes margins - is falling, the price of risk premiums that banks and caisses pay for its issues to obtain liquidity is already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
“We didn’t tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of spreads - see CincoDías on November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger dimensions will be requested."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He claims that capital needs are “increasing enormously” and some Spanish financial entity could be hitting the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in raising funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
Having assured that Sabadell can survive the temporal closing of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that one cannot issue, but contrary to what happened in June, one can obtain short-term financing through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between caisses
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and stressed again the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been made, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, they are adjustments."
“Most of it has been completed completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well,” he said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Managers and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the deadlines that have been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain".
"The change from 45 crates with an average of 28.500 million assets volume to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be in conformity with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of rather unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The CEO of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and attributed to the people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a process of concentration "very important" and "goes at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has managed to overcome the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin opted to remain in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have prompted a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or the elimination of 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel’s criticism of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another constraint on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, in Germany we are beginning to speculate on the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if now it seems like science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal rigour, fines to the countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for apologies.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (fiscal tightening plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second blow by the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should witness the reform process of the Union that will make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany tells us that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked to do is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give us greater peace of mind.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity that we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel’s criticisms, the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home has been paved the way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are envisaged, one cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone too full of unserious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 game against Ajax in the Champions League has caused a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is known, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, both players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next match of the playoff against Auxerre and will be able to go without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned with two matches the team's coach, José Mourinho, and different economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten, but followed, rules of this sport.
A part of the debate that arose in the related case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and which on past occasions has condemned to a fine to its players for similar acts) and to the provocative dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho's histories, which adds to his story.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour does not expressly prohibit by the regulations contradict the principles of sport, that is, whether with these actions one commits a fraud of law; because, indeed, they are actions respectful of the sports regulations, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these assets that are referred to with the correct game is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty from the referee.
They were waiting and willingly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the intentional misconduct investigated.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the opponent and one does not obtain an advantage in the same match, because obviously the result of the action supposes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not rely on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without any cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with some degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a sanction match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, climbing the ladders is not so clear that this is an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which still includes the making of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), but otherwise they chose rather the time at which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the line between genius and law fraud is blurred, on this occasion I think we've had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way of transmitting the director to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives also return the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive you adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year's calendar (as New Year's Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated requests into the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (the 17th and the 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying from their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer’s representative, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices,” he said.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers have a tendency to go down a rung with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey of various establishments of the centre we see the collapse of requests for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a real demand boom for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar meant more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done everything possible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a boom in turnover since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, like the Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the Fecasarm board (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall the reservations are "animated", even if the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That’s true, hope for the festivities hasn’t dropped, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan’s nuclear program raises serious concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
WikiLeaks leaks confirm connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns raised in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Aside from the enlightening and tasty details they offer about the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, “decreases” and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster pace than any other country”.
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
The ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, said in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev during a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The news of the documentation filtered by Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani degree of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", said: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit of the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Army of Pakistan must end with tacit support to terrorist groups."
Chasing the head of WikiLeaks
Obama will appoint a senior counter-terrorism official to prevent further infiltration.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this one is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20.
And this one has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
WikiLeaks’ creator, Mark Stephens, said: “Police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
On the 20th, the international police force headquartered in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
The 188 countries of Interpol have been instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot issue an arrest order for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice call a free path to arrest - which the national police body must carry out - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England.
The movement outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's chief of security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview with Time magazine's director via Skype, in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If we can show that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they are spying on at the UN in violation of international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counter-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides contributions or assistance to them."
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to reverse his remarks after saying that Assange should “be murdered.”
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something similar.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
“Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than an execution would be too kind a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for resolving the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and that this can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national councillors of ERC will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising your hand.
If the coredists want to convey a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
The people close to Carod demand from the president a little more than putting his position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider a sure fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet has signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovation thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first, to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new figures who come from the sector adept of Carod.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate the assembly once and for all as a working mechanism.
Thus, he advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending up with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the turbulent 2008 conclave tasked management with revising the assembly model in a specific statute reform congress.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be right to take it back and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases we mention that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the coup de grâce to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the luggage compartment of an abandoned vehicle in Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan municipality.
Early Thursday morning, the four owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots as he was leaving his house to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a shot to the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the forehead we found the corpse of a man on a solitary path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet struck with a firearm of calibre 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán alerted to the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to the neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was located that had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, the body of a dead woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman were detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with blunt heads and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón settlement and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag on the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China Maintains Goals to Reduce Greenhouse Gases
The country’s representative at COP16 assured that his country has made huge efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent until 2020.
China is maintaining its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the goals for reducing greenhouse gases, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with government and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficient Use Program, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by energy-efficient lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts were greater than previously thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's taking up the protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Commission of Order."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he made clear that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on 4 and 5 December where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its objective," he said.
The panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we taste it and make us stronger", he said.
He said that probably the council will know how to elect the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would hand over the succession "to the person determined by the council."
“I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five.”
He predicted that the revival recorded by the party in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next dispute, even if "this is not yet the time to think about 2012."
“At the moment it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task.”
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have had "a lot of hopes regarding them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms of President Felipe Calderón over his speech during his four-year rule, César Nava asked PRIists to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet,” he said.
He said that the incumbent of the Federal Executive can make expressions like the ones he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes law for undocumented students on Twitter
“If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message maintains an open cyber link to a broader document that calls on the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
“With a vote that we hope for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the Bush-era extension of tax cuts and government funding extends.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax issue is resolved, an agenda can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
“We all agree that this tax problem needs to be resolved before the end of the year.”
"I think we can get a deal at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he will call for a "debate closing vote" on the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although the most likely would be next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, have remained in that country for the past five years, and have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the participation of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project's partisan organizations are protagonists of intense lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Yet at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
This is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature one puts one’s finger on the wound
The second stage of the Language Pleasures was a walk in which the participants showed the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... finger on the wound? what is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table has been dedicated to the language).
The finger on the wound" ... puts us in embarrassment ", gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it is perhaps my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who took his breath away in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "on the wound I could only know that it is what is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a lovely narrative that he titled Praise of Invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous sorceress who touched clouds, made people return who had gone far or repaired virtues that a damsel had lost, a narrative that turns to speak then America, the great news that had from the beginning its own chroniclers and quoted to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the people.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a different way one would never have told the story of America with an imagination that lacked even modesty."
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "crazy people and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, it is no longer known what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is called the ‘Cervantes tradition’.
“It is because of his legacy that we are what we tell.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations brought about by the FIL's invitation with her round table Le doit sur la plaie.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican has put hers on the great scourge of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must be on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
“To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times putting your finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established and nuanceless ideas and also disturbing powers who prefer a world in black and white,” he said.
Romano hunting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three losses in the finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find between them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three losses in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has not put in the spotlight and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up comforting himself with the medal of sub-champion, he remained one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Sanctista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he was holding the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; subsequently, in the Closure 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team made an equal 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalties series he got a 3-1 advantage with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players lost the result by 4 to 11 meters.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any stats, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," the helmsman commented when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, of which he assures that he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the final, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run the match, and I think that's the one before the end.
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the fate has served us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish to hold us in our hands.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Service Centers for Visa Applicants prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (VSCs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, among which the following are mentioned:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for merchants and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only report to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken from the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA to announce discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency has cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will release an astrobiological discovery Thursday that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference Thursday at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest satellite of Saturn), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germ PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is made possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when in Congress appeared an opposition bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Houses.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we are initiating ‘bipartism’ because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with PRD coordinator Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, were the only ones to vote against the Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the pattern from a political will and if they do not have it, they will again be enslaved by both parties and in this way will end the opposing coalition.
“So far [the opposition coalition] has arrived, that’s what I’m looking at, because we’re excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow Congress, after being monopolistic, to be now "duopolistic."
“It is not in the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now the Congress has turned into a 'booty' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it into two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the MP’s personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
“That they don’t leave out cupular agreements at 5 that will probably be 9 MPs, now at the five that we are seen, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place in the negotiating table, that’s the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are out and we don’t agree with that reform there.”
$200 million more for the "provider"
The City of Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount that was paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1,200 million pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of suppliers account".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, consequently, how many cheques will still be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
“We didn’t buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the latter on November 16.
Although the provider has not yet published in the Official State Gazette, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Northwest had published a review of the cheques that the City Council issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourism sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be taken care of and new activities should replace those that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the clutter and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know how much money you lose, otherwise they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not only make the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it doesn't just depend on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They haven't been given the proper attention and this kind of fact underscores something that is notorious to everyone, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, deputy secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that must be in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MPs should take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it is facing.
The business sector of Mazatlán is calling for a dignified and free of agreements Labour Legislature between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and facing major problems.
Yesterday was installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MPs should take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it is facing.
"We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to watch over their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Governor is advancing.
"We will ensure that they do a decent and above all committed job with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate stimulus for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate job creation.”
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that it competes directly with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to classify resources to detonator tourism projects that help to give security to the state and update the Law of Alcohol that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is made up of no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they desire so much.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' for sale in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo longs to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesús, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very dear," recalls sadly Cayetana.
For older children, who was in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
11-year-old María Guadalupe is wearing size 12; 10-year-old Isaías is wearing size 10, while 8-year-old Miguel is wearing size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of athletic shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign On Looking for King Mage, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Northwest.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were expected to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches followed a long-running investigation that lasted nearly a year.
"It is information received from the public that has allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec regional investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphrémagog took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should address the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated as the three opposition parties said Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
“I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet,” Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said as he was surrounded by MPs after the caucus’ weekly meeting.
The Liberals argue that the proposed bill, which would detain anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because it is attacking the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow has rejected criticism that her party is not strong enough about illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that we should take action against smugglers, and that's what we're doing through another bill, C-35," Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling MPs massively that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a mattress."
"They expect Canada to take strong action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections if it were rejected.
One Conservative, however, told QMI that the government would ask for a vote so that every MP who opposes would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unity is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this subject as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on police services in Quebec, on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
The public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, called the announcement a "rabbit out of a hat" and "a DIY solution on the corner of a table."
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future unity.
“You’ll see the result when we announce it,” he said.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and I that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggested Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the cartons of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
The request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague from Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently reviewing certain amendments related to this matter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit groups of bikers, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several waterways remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two homes were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, heavy rain fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
Since these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some areas, there are fears of overflowing several streams.
Flood warning warnings were issued Wednesday night by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, at Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall led to the overflow of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Centre de prévision des crues du Québec issued Wednesday warnings of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) over controversial comments about social assistance and Haitians, as well as his rude language on the air.
The CBSC finds that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day."
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the release of the names of two individuals who committed suicide, did not violate broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during programs broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Quebec Common Front of Social Workers.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the program were inaccurate.
Animators should present solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the host Stéphane Dupont had considered that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont le Midi' have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame was placed on him.
The latest litigation concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had provoked many reactions.
The CHOI facilitator said that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because it could not be certain that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on this."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of gross language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during peak listening hours within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special background.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has been based in the city since 2008 to develop among professionals.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, he who works as a security officer and as a clerk for UPS has delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories," he said.
"Currently, I am preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished in the top four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
“At this pace, I’ll be first this time or next year!”
San shou or sanda is a discipline originally from China where punching and kicking, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
Duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will surely answer his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This is the highest and most prestigious competition in China," explained the friendly guy.
"It's kind of the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category come together to crown one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded over-the-counter contracts worth $450 million to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium made up of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor obtained the most important, that of the project stewardship, for a sum of $295 million without bidding.
This consortium called Énergie gerence was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy stewardship consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing an increase in prices.
"It's the new way to collude and knock down the competition."
"In other words, people, instead of doing it secretly, now do it openly," Péquis MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he says it is difficult to see how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my journey," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigour".
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The formula of consortiums is a common practice throughout the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is underway and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; there was negotiation.
Therefore, the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula for consulting engineering consortiums is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the Québec business register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads back to one and the same legal entity, Dessau.
Regarding the Energy Management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "James Bay responds to particular workforce dynamics and Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s".
The great boss of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that raised the eyebrow about the fact that the project stewardship contract was granted over-the-counter.
"If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and at a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that matters, it's the competence of the people," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy stewardship consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Genivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting its participation in Energie gérance.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 Energy stewardship contract.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec."
The minister Normandeau dismissed that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "fund" it, before specifying that they were rather its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair brands and eco-friendly certifications to guide his choices.
Even worse, even if he bathes in a media universe where messages in favor of more responsible consumption are rife, he deplores a lack of credible information, a deficiency that he even describes as a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatoire de la consommation responsable of the Université Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this part of consumption currently animated by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information would calm the ardors of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are as suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services as they are trying to get into their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habits and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At the level of 61%, they also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they used public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this large behavioral survey, which has just taken its first snapshot.
A state loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus Society and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but only for one loan.
The Angus Development Corporation and the Parallel, who were hoping for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois's eXcentris film complex on St. Lawrence Boulevard by restoring it to its full cinematic vocation, did not get what they were demanding.
The government agrees to be involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would be lower than the original expectations, which could constitute a viable solution at advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources coming from the offices of the State.
A first action plan and a request of $12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet’s counter-proposal arrived at SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the state-gift hypothesis really needs to be dismissed.
Recall that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
But many in the community were demanding substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceens, spent ten years carrying author cinema to its premises in the complex after having financed its construction himself, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Board.
The lack of cinemas for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are running a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three theatres on February 27 by screening Xavier Beauvois’ beautiful film Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the U.S. considers the Canadians’ inferiority complex to the Americans, but they also betray the latter’s sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are astonished that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-U.S. relations in mind when going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the federal election campaign, tells how much the United States is not one of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may be conditioning Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday domestic issues rather than focusing this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he wrote.
The United States is thus, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about.”
The ambassador understands all the less this “deafening silence” as the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, the Ottawa Business Officer, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the federal budget confidence vote in early February, whereby Canada will show its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-40 billion stimulus plan," Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties were making its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that drama series broadcast on CBC send back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's abductions for muscular interrogations.
Another cable relates that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Kouchner said yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, note that the minds are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “murdered.”
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) that corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be achieved to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50-70% of the market were replaced by fluorescent compact bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be used to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance to stabilize the increase of the climate to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced by two times more.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like the ones Philips was launching this week - this company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible savings with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent compact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place guidelines.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast nervously awaits the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire to be published "without delay" after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission passed the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CIS said on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Calls were multiplied on Wednesday in the world for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said the FN's intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denies any link to the former rebels, said the delay in announcing the results was "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go as far as claiming victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the election commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the head of the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of the former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% counting the overseas departments), show the provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed stands at 2,631 million in the metropolis.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOM.
Over a year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 point over three months, +0.5 point over one year) and 25% including the DOM.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
For their part, seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 point over three months as well as over one year), or 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the DOM.
Only 25-49-year-olds benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolitan area (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
INSEE has not published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a manager of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the general council of the Bouches-du-Rhône, was indicted and imprisoned at the prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been indicted for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, concealment, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, and not fantasies."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible charges, it's another matter to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS strongman in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, wanted, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted Wednesday night and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of the funds linked to their operation, he was never aware of it, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for misappropriation of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts he is accused of."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been indicted and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them placed under judicial supervision, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director for cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted one for "subtraction and embezzlement of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity in embezzlement of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was indicted for "a misuse of social goods".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of having been used to launder money from the big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
Source close to the investigation, the investigations focus on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", has kept opinion in the air in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some undersides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on dealing with their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not have as a counterpart the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detainee in France and wanted by the US justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put in a raw light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to credit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drawn up on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysée’s advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talk with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly detained nationals to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "keep hammering" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate liberation."
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more as the Iranians are asking you not to do it.”
Because, after attempts to talk through discrete channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is “a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he says that the Elysee anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another one of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains stranded in Iran.
The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is being demanded by the United States for illegally smuggling sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is being released in Paris on the orders of a judge.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, wonders about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is stalking Iran’s clandestine networks for acquiring material for its nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee, he said, not only “was completely taken by surprise by the judge’s decision,” but sought to oppose it.
"There was a lively exchange between the French presidency and the guard of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not reverse the decision" judicial, he observes.
Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The adviser to the Elysee dials a phone number, hangs up and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian “is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy”.
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts, through press releases and “leaks” organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an “important” and “influenced” role of “mediator”.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles pass on the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what is based so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then examines the reasons that prompted the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unmerited."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: “Of course, we don’t know if the Syrians have done anything.”
"But we thanked them anyway."
"It should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, officials from the ministries of culture and family said.
“Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who claim it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host countries
In the midst of turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where struggles for influence and lobbying risk taking precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will take place in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The one of 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implantation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
The negotiations behind the scenes are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), may have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC released a documentary featuring three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is enough to displease FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who have embarked on an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the forefront.
The head of the government hopes to reissue the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the Olympics-2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore the coat of arms of England to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack strengths with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial outlook of both countries could shower their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a major outsider despite the shortcomings of its record (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, appear as the logical favorites.
The world's leading economic powerhouse, home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-hosted the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would in fact render the Asian chances for 2022 void.
With Qatar, which brought out the big game with futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the low TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the obvious
De Gaulle was hesitant.
Mitterrand had made it seem that he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A mandate at the Elysee calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not go hand in hand with the mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then we have to act as if doubt still exists.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a grave air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of the year 2011".
That he evokes before parliamentarians UMP, Tuesday evening at the Elysee, the prospect of "two terms" has therefore sown a bit of feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from it.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election, in a humorous tone, at such meetings.
“At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me,” he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him more a candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
If they get comments, it is for two reasons.
Acceleration of the race for the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it is not Ségolène Royal’s entry into the competition that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
It is on the contrary because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS demand an order of battle earlier than expected.
The bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," the prime minister's entourage immediately and cautiously reacted.
"If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," Raffarin said.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to keep buying government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the way out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations that are due to end by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis means that the Frankfurt issuing institution will probably not be able to afford to be so peremptory or worsen a situation that is more than tense today on European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, praised the active role played by the ECB in resolving the debt crisis of states in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...)".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more dissenting about his intentions, content to indicate that the program of buying government bonds on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, ECB Treasury bond purchases doubled last week to nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretion of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have bought for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that there will be a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a significant change in direction.
While the ECB has already eliminated over-three-month lending from its arsenal, the ECB continues to allocate unlimited liquidity on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this arrangement to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she's making a big change to her program."
"Otherwise, it would be risking further short-term tensions," said Commerzbank economist Michael Schubert.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
- Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to drive a dim market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of the exposures of European banks to the sovereign debt markets of the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a slump in the returns paid by the most fragile states," said a senior bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, the states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government turns its back
After a disturbing start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a bit yesterday with the ebb of 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of the region said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "undecipherable" and expect a weekend "unpredictable", which the interested one then denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the gap with German long rates had reached the record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy hedge contracts (CDS) had soared to 263 points, causing some panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain, the gap with German rates was above 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" by "market turmoil" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax revenues that goes with it, making the state run the risk of not being able to cover its financing needs anymore.
Brussels’ latest forecast was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate is forecast at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (against 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short-term or long-term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, ed.), the stabilization efforts demanded from Italy are less than those demanded from other countries," said Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
Then there is the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up an unfavourable period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe it has been demonstrated again on Sunday in the day and in the night, are obviously solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European state bonds has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of normalization.
The ratings agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on banking systems in particular," say the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is much slower than market time.”
Aware of this gap and the dangers it conceals, European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
And this is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support the euro area countries in the eyes of the markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform far-eastern investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly preparing the ground for them.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in the funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The frontline countries, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to the austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both want at all costs to avoid seeking international assistance before putting in place their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that are essential for restoring lasting confidence.
Finally, European lenders are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
While in Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to put forward the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to put its hand in the wallet.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an increase of about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would suffice, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, with a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance to be examined carefully in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
The snowy episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienne, have joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are sufficiently noticeable to generate traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Meteo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departmental roads have been banned for heavy trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend to take his vehicle only in case of necessity and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy airport and 10% at Orly due to upcoming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, the billions are raining.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, there are mentions of 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow from the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally arrive at the first additions.
The amending 2010 finance law, which was examined in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements planned to find the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is quantified: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase its product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We are far from $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of the capital allocation that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," the statement said.
At the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenues (both taxes), we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after, it is explained."
"It will be written in the budget and pulled out as it goes."
The SGP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be included in the 2014 budget in 2013.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised are still to the absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and spies on diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file made up of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those of which Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi's sinisterly caricatural profile has long been for sketch-material cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should be composed of only known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous works.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (nor does he know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and that reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
I'm going for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, what do I know, editor at Liberation), who retains as true only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same information that Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since heads of state can phone or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into espionage centers.
Any investigative film viewer knows this very well, and it is only out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that any hacker could capture the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put the victims as much in crisis as the "bulls".
But let’s get to the deeper nature of what happened.
In Orwell’s time, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had completely proved itself since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the possibility of keeping its own secrets keep it?
It is true, Georg Simmel was already saying, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means to reveal everything in him.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to post any confidential information online - it would be like posting it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wired (telephone) telegraph.
Video cassettes (analogue) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backwards and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) allow only to jump from chapter to chapter, that is to say by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, you get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips that it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is not surprising, then, that politics and communications techniques revert to horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret embassies.
Now it is the embassies that are requesting confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France trivializes its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the promises of rapidly unlocked financing (so-called fast-start or early financing) made by developed countries.
And the big French docks are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (or 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU took the big step to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast-start financing: a report detailing the action of its member states, a press conference, a major side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and valued: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of 7.2 billion euros in 2012.
But when you look at it in detail, things get more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without detriment to ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some member states whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has considered the year 2009 as a reference: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast-start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to spending in previous years or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
Concretely, the total amount of support from France to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment in terms of "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Here again, there is no rule and everyone chooses his mode of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> lent is equivalent to 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to mitigation of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that will be given... At most, it should only be counted as its commitments.
But France has nothing to do with such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the EU to use the loan so extensively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 1 to satisfy its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass-through tour!
In summary, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, it manages to make believe that it is spending <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely duped...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to all the climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully that will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the question of "additionality" or the way loans are accounted for will not escape.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingested 81 different chemical substances in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (ex-Movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no statistically significant value in relation to the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the foods usually consumed in four meals and a snack in one day by a child of ten years, in supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as treats, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The bottom line is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear from our investigation that the reality of consumers' exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is of concern," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for Kenyan green beans, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even breadstick and chewing gum were filled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the “richest” with 34 chemical residues detected, and even examining the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The ultimate risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktail" "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "facing the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
