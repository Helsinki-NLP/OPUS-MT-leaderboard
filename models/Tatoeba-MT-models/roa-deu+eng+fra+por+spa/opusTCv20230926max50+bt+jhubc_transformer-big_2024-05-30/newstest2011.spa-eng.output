The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry
The new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD councillors in the capital are going to have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed SDG partners.
The Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz period "examined" the members of the new Council of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to check their knowledge of the language marked slang that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The codified dictionary used by the political flower and cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand those well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
“Who is Voldemort?”
“The truth is, I don’t know.”
"I'm rather a novice in Prague politics," cultural councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> said during the "colleague" terminology exam.
And as far as the veteran politician is concerned, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted the same way.
You may know the concept of "golf hole".
"It's possibly the only expression of all the ones you asked me that I use from time to time."
"If not, I usually don't use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions the newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz published last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial staff chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities in Prague.
Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "going to the bakery", "bull's neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "blind".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínik, directly refused to do so.
“I don’t get involved in these things and I don’t think I’m going to appreciate how the Democrats have fun.”
"What matters to me is how we will understand each other in executing our programs," he said.
As has been seen, Councilman Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not realize that the above title is an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
To Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> the word "Voldemort" says nothing; the only term he hit on the exam is "Prague's largest golf hole".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, who immediately adds: "But I know more about it from the news."
“I’m going to have to sign up for a language course,” he jokes.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Environment Councilman Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort really is and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it is soon revealed to Plach<0xC3><0xBD> that it is the headquarters of the companies of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he indicates that such knowledge he obtained from the news, but that he does not employ such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among socio-democrats.
"I asked my teammates, but it really looks like we don't have anything like it."
"Instead, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or we make puns with names," says the president of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whose partymates call Hulda.
"In school I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íza, but I don't know if my classmates also call me B<0xC5><0x99>íza," confesses his own nickname Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and it works.
For his party colleagues, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the election cheating during the party's sponsorship, gets the nickname "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobil") from some of his colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that the Social Democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of club rights" seems to recall that Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> obtained his doctorate in law from the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a pamphlet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually old, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
Women who "become" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the town.
"Men rarely suffer such but."
“We also do not isolate healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso, is taken care of in a special residence of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an informative pamphlet that should help prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a catch.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” warns Die Standard newspaper about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a wretched pile of circumstances.
According to his version, the woman was caught in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “The devourers of human souls have always represented a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, following his aunt's death, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that allegedly had been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by black magic."
“To help, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, forcibly took randomly chosen men and women from among the Gambian peoples to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the people arrested had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the detainees did not survive the stay on the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
Bakala’s tenant heats up with charcoal stoves and signs higher rent
The elderly and tough man crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zde<0xC5><0x88>ek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is serving his sentence.
All three have just been caught up in the liberalization of rents.
Instead of CZK 3,500 per month, the son will pay CZK 4,100 for a two-room apartment with a separate second-class kitchen starting next year.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, over whose firm he has full powers.
“But I signed it,” he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, man only makes a move.
“Everyone says one thing,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large liberalization testing laboratory.
After New Year’s Eve it will happen with the vast majority of apartments that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
That is why Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, by Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to him a machine to take number.
"Rental 2011" can be read on a light button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a small piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
There is almost no time to read "157" and the number already appears on the big screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for settlements, insurance issues, and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the cards an increase of the rent of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
“It’s been running for a week, so it’s starting,” the workers who are in it respond, after briefly hesitating, when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and former Bakala miners’ flats are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were treated loudly and clearly by the vice-president of the Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek, from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new soil."
“They didn’t even change my goddamn bathroom plate,” the man mentioned in the introduction vents.
According to the workers, at the moment they come mostly retired to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" certainly does not manage to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked for rent in 2011," the employee of the window estimates.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, an independent judge must settle the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed that is possible and completely compliant with the law," RPG warns in its pages.
"No one is going to be judged here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court,” he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait," he says.
Rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
“The current rents do not yet cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund,” recalls Pavel Klima<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, adding that the careless state of the community fund that angers the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years that elapsed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in rentals in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlights in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
“In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 CZK per month per square meter,” the display reads.
Only increased by 38% the rental of 400 floors of the portfolio of RPG.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, 19.66 kroner per square meter," RPG said.
On 2,600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not suddenly affect rents, but will scale from four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money of the hike of the rent (see the graph) again in the floors, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the hike agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need nursery
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch.Design company.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with everything proper to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio came numerous well-known buildings from Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini daycare.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly in the baby boom age and wanted to allow the architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity leave.
Together with the possibility to enjoy a reduced schedule, the daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its workers as part of its social program.
The builders and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-nursery was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-garden is financed through the European Social Fund under the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme, as well as the Czech Republic’s state budget.
Thanks to the funding granted (a dotation of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), the company Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mini-garden in operation with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the Economy Rating company contributed to the submission of the financing application.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present throughout the day for their care. The daycare centre currently accommodates children without age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it is a "mini-store", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-kindergarten program are comparable to the usual preschool program.
In it children not only play, but also receive a quality education: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach English.
The class has not only toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive when they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced the marketing of personnel.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Look at Gaudí’s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colours, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all are typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought order is observed.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the twisting of the forms continues to surprise us also inside.
Corrugated wood copies window frames, railings, door trims, viewfinders and signs.
Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street Passeig de Gràcia, arose from the remodeling of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of making a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their plans of the project emerged ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí’s Casa Milá and Güell Park, in which other parts of it can be found.
Because of its organic form, the locals shortly after its completion dubbed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the building, the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building conceal religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Its inclination of forty-five degrees may be strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect the building rules of the time at all and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the reconstruction planned were so vague that, two years later, upon its completion, the city council was so shocked with the result that it asked to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
Arrangements were never made, quite the contrary: only fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, of six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase that leads up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the lounges and a larger group can communicate this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí’s reconstruction, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with the two colors brings maximum light to all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which instead absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most crowded apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of entry to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly befriend some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and the bed frame: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface for lying down, that is, the mattress and the spring.
Above all, they must complement each other perfectly so that they adapt to the specific users.
During the election come into play numerous elements, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and bed base is located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them more frequently.
If the channels in the center are not properly aerated and, above, they are on a firm basis, they keep moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, hard surface.
“Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, so they receive bad information from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in quilted furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem anymore, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard game.
It just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to your height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example for singles, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk towards your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert from Cechu <0xC4><0x8D>alouník<0xC5><0xAF> to decorater<0xC5><0xAF>, who has been specializing in the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years.
In double rooms, each needs its own bed base and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the frames at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interior a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
“When you touch it with your hand or settle on the mattress, you certainly shouldn’t notice the springs,” warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a certain type of bed base.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and you can not wash your cover, which today is often done.
And, since we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat every night, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, the sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of cleaning and washing the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers are currently manufactured with a zipper closure throughout its perimeter, so when opening them they are left in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In bed, instead of a bedspread, do you have a firm board?
Never! Never!
At most for the beds designed for overnight visits.
However, it should make (if you don’t already have them) vent holes in the board and should be used with a mattress with springs on the inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (like the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulatable sheet beds containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although it is always better to have a bed with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lower back are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Hinged sheet beds should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows pressing or even tilting the sheets in such a way that they "surround" perfectly the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "male", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are springs with cross structure or tablets with the so-called multi-torsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that, even if you use the right mattress and bed base, if you use a bad pillow (large and "muffled"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach up to the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can be relaxed.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder pad or softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Tropico Plus company.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with plant extracts of breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "warm" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warmth.
Favorites right now?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold foam and viscoelastic stiffnesses allow to manufacture mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and sommiers.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a Memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is free.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
It initially emerged as material for NASA, because during the takeoffs astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents use people tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for tracking vehicles, can also track the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old girl Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to learn about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
“We all try to tell each other that this is not about spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy happening,” said Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone’s purse without their knowledge, but we have not yet come across such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” adds Pilin.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková warns about the fact that, if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled.”
“In the past, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In his opinion, it is debatable whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it is a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always check if the child is carrying any kind of electronic device that can reveal his location.”
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices expands, it will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be made with a lot of publicity."
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even in the event that, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can serve as a help.
"You can configure the device to regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If it suffers damage, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The most expensive devices have a built-in tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and stands still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his view, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, on which only special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a similar size to a box of matches or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, that’s why devices that look like a digital clock are currently being tested.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
"Or identify it after a while, which can save the police time," he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will still use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to surround the whole of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to set off explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of wick to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the wick is two years, four at the most.
The army bought the wick for explosives from the STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick by saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of wick per year.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnicians of the army, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives should be carried out every year also all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
Neither Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr nor army captain Vlastimil Picek wanted exemptions.
Only in this way could the army be justified in spending sixty kilometers of wick.
Such a length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (including adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained personally to Minister Vondra because they say that they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices are limited for the sake of money.
And let’s not talk about the lack of underwear.
“I also don’t understand why they repeatedly buy us such amounts of wick.”
“But it’s their decision and they’ll certainly know why they’re acting like that.”
“For us, the military is a good customer that we, as a company, try to satisfy,” admits STV Group sales director Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defends the hundreds of kilometers of wick by also saying that he will have stockpiles of this "ammo" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of STV Group says that the wick has a service life of only four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, of two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of wick, it got a discount.
“They cost us 60% less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” said Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry’s procurement center.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of police pyrotechnics, who dispose of World War II ammunition or ammunition left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only for the right amount to exhaust the ammunition before its useful life ends.
They decided for safety reasons for the pyrotechnicians and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable wick types can be obtained.
The Ministry is already struggling to finish tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: you will have to remove hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I am still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
The last edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun of Liberec.
His success story seems to be taken from a movie.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered from seasonal jobs abroad and a loan from the bank he bought a house that was half-broken consisting of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
“Currently, the value for money of the accommodation in our area pushed me to do something about it,” says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He began renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back into the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room boarding house.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it has gradually managed to open in Liberec four guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another one of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” said the number one entrepreneur last year.
"This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels greatly helped the fact of winning the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' contest," Pytloun added.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," she recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends everyone who wants to try a company that participates in the contest.
But it considers that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, until now, he continues to live on contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I started collaborating regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included employees,
In total about seventy.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition.”
“It’s not, let alone my own personal success, but it’s the result of the hard work of the entire team.”
“Only my name is on the front page,” says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria for victory was soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone "Company of the Year" contest, last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight against the competition," says the winner of last year.
The story of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the state proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of property during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They gained a greater presence also among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the competition in the media.
“Not only did our customers start to consider the Farmet brand to be considerably better, but foreign partners also started to value the collaboration with a company that was most successful in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year perhaps it wasn’t just a display of the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
It also obtained recognition for the commercial results up to 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for machinery sales.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to halt their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, aren't getting rid of such a situation either."
“Revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must sometimes adopt even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut spending was on research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened our presence on the international market and obtained excellent valuations at national fairs," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
All indications are that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are increasing again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that unveils ridiculous rules
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He has already succeeded in removing some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the year’s Absurdity survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
“The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the trade register when carrying out a check on the insured’s taxes,” said <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová.
The objective of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of the corporate tournament of the publication Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny and begins to create hobby also among the general public.
While last year’s edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year practically reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations to spare that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in terms of the number of papers required for the tax return we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, Czech Republic is in the 74th position, that is, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than 100 were submitted for this year’s survey, in particular 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
Examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year’s seventy proposals is published on the contest pages.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, the event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state continually puts obstacles on entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” announced the Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not end in borage.
In 2007, what annoyed people the most was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a stand to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the office of work by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
The third is the loser.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their office a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
That is why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the contest of Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny is the category called Responsible Company of the year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
“In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the Vodafone company, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of the main Vodafone Company competition of the year 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example disabled persons, in others it is for personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main donor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a stationery shop that is especially concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the workforce; for this reason, it was awarded the title of Company Responsible for the Central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the Year contest finished third in the region.
In Olomouc won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment,” explains the entrepreneur Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
The Enlogit IT company in charge of the <0xC3><0x9A>stí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them a chair and ergonomic keyboards; in addition, it supports the work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Person in Distress grant, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company's representative.
The laundromat company Praní a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>ní of the Karlovy Vary region is also well placed with a mention, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that have an impact on their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, skills improvement and leisure," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> of the Bruntál Czasch construction company, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the Responsible Company of the Year category, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest who answered questions on the registration form and submitted it before August 15 to the organizers were automatically nominated.
The organizers removed from the evaluation the forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year contest, but they are not disqualified from the Vodafone Company of the Year "principal" contest."
"Individual entries for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Company of the Year competition," explains Karel Goldman of the consulting firm Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police have made several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media businessman and real estate entrepreneur Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land is received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million crowns for it.
“At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender,” Pilsen chief prosecutor Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that at the moment she cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four hours later, police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how it could influence the public auction, given the little official information, one can only speculate.
Agricultural Fund spokeswoman Lubomíra <0xC4><0x8C>erná responded to Právo’s questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
“This is a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public auction is called "Call for submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the Land Act" and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the offered land.
"These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Based on the bids, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest bid," the Fund spokeswoman explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information on who was going to apply for the call and, since he was also an interested person because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
For that, he was collecting a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of his arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was included in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained from the Fund land intended for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular on the site where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Later, he exchanged them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city had to intervene because, otherwise, the blockaded land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay additional expenses of several hundred kroner per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rents.
As a result, from January onwards, families will have to withdraw several hundred kroner a month more than they do now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by about 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 kroner more a year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers cut prices, as support for the production of energy from renewable sources, particularly photovoltaics, has increased.
However, gas is moderately expensive, especially at a time when heating is used the most and therefore the higher the consumption.
In this case, they should also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are rising across the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 kroner per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 kroner per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially in case the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Pragueers will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
Prices for 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where the regulation will end in January, can increase considerably.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem around 2,500 floors, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will bring to court those who disagree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase next year by as much as 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in mode, because it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
Those are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors encountering such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get them drunk."
"Strong alcoholic beverages are now the fashion," Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán, head of pediatrics at Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia, told Právo.
"When they manage to get a bottle from their father in the cupboard, it may be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
“Vodka has the advantage that it lightens up with juice and doesn’t smell so much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
“In some cases, they use brandy that they picked up at home,” adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, thirteen and fourteen-year-old drinkers often appear in hospitals.
Prior to Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where she has been working since this year, she worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to check in maybe four times."
"She started at the age of 12, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," the department's doctor said of the case.
"He was at the Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother wasn't surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours," he said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot speak properly of dependency.
"Alcoholic is a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, this year at the pediatric clinic in Motol, forty drunk children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, the statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the ambulance medical examination, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply meet after school and drink liquor, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs that should be mentioned: Halloween, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for the bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
“On Halloween, I saw up to seven drunken children in admissions at the same time,” adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is prevented by injecting a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"These are much better off, because after the hectic night, they get up well and it doesn't hurt at all."
“They’re only confused about where they are,” Pelikán says, adding that patients often lose their mood at least when they see the expenses they’ve generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for severe patients can cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when in the visit I tell them directly to the children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend all summer in a job for young people so that you would earn enough to pay that night," adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for the costs of treatment, does not in the case of drinking children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Defense Ministry replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time that such a device has been in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for internship or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seater version L-159T1, which until now was used by the Czech army and which was still in a flying state.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seat aircraft.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>k, of the defense press department, said it was not yet known when the aircraft would be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
“The L-159T1 two-seaters were exchanged in their current state,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told Právo.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seat aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for the amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seat aircraft.
One of the new aircraft has already been received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has pledged that the aircraft will be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for pilot practices from NATO countries."
“It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how they will be used in this framework,” says Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The newspaper Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny published early that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense direction states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa aircraft and the last one should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a longer index than the ring index are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that relative finger length may constitute a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other detrimental factors, such as family health problems, Eeles said.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the annular finger.
They had the same odds of getting prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under the age of 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows the study, but does not think the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "completely demonstrated."
The Czech Republic in the snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, was covered in snow on Thursday.
The roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and the snow removers circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road between 89 and 93 km was closed towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC5><0x99>edního automotoklubu (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck broke down, in 93 two commercial vehicles collided, causing injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the gutter.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers must drive slowly past Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and join at kilometer 182 in K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
Several kilometres of traffic jams have formed there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, just off Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
For example, traffic jams are forming in Prosek, although <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí and Nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí Míru.
At 8 a.m., another state of crisis will take place in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three quickly.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> airport was closed from 11 p.m. on Wednesday to 5 a.m.
Currently, it can already be driven on most roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brn<0xC4><0x9B>nska snow tongues are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment it is not possible to say when they will be opened to circulation.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region, which, since they are a protected natural area, simply have to be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, further in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfalls gradually remit in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The US military is deploying a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" towards its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with extremely precise aiming.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall, or trench.
Undoubtedly, normal protection cannot be used, and when you throw your killer rain of metal chips, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point their laser beam at it, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the line of projection and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
“When the trigger is pressed, the weapon loads and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters,” Audette says.
400 new jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will move their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance giant reported on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from its previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman said that in the medium term another 100 employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office at Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against it.
Frankfurt’s head of economics, Markus Frank (CDU), said he won a “Global Player”.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site."
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu’s decision.
The management informed the city of their intention earlier.
"Of course we have offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons led to the fall.
In such a way, there is now a large empty place to fill in the famous stall.
"I hope the owner and the landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The building previously used by Fujitsu on the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of a controversial construction project for the resort city with the remaining buildings on Marienbader Platz for ten years.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the city council, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and the level of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and appraisal companies, the software manufacturer for reservation systems Start Amadeus, were installed, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt-based real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more businesses in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is based in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company under the name TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anxiety is increasingly taking over WikiLeaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind it lies political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is reportedly detained in England.
WikiLeaks’ platform of revelations is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an internet homeland in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations communicated via the messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website to be able to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “Perfect, we’ll allocate our dollars to hiring people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon halted the use of its server via Wikileaks after an employee of Sen. Joe Lieberman requested investigations, CNN reported according to a call to Lieberman’s office.
The presidency of the senate council for the security of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
“I had wanted Amazon to take these steps before, before previous classified information publications through WikiLeaks,” he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban the use of the server in other countries.
“The illegal, monstrous and reckless WikiLeaks process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world,” the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently labeled the Swedish investigation as a plot by his enemy.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why we fear for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains unrevealed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to North American statements.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee said the person responsible for WikiLeaks’ revelations should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should “be killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange a great dispute grows.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had asked for the secretary of state's resignation, should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed as an exceptional steward, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms" that are necessary in light of the WikiLeaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the US government announced that to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of WikiLeaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream parlors are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream parlors has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
The ice cream maker and the ice cream maker.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice cream.
The gelataio takes the ice cream off the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the can and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with freezer in the year 2003, so that the ice cream cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream parlors has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream parlor of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk in the soft ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a teacher of this art from California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari then explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation nor the cream cover of the national and mainly southern upper house of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why every ball has something romantic."
The first step in the process seems easy.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and a basic white pasteurized cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you let go of some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they dismiss the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", has perhaps used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a sounding granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweets section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to squeeze flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"However, you must experience it sometime."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Course participants can now use the freezers.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream each time, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better doesn’t necessarily depend on having more toffee aroma or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to taste like nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and somewhat less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mix highlights the flavor of the ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream making is an arithmetic problem: Peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, you have to lower the sugar ratio of the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano pulls out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the count easier.
Making ice cream does not require more than physical application, as before.
Not only does the utensil help for the automatic processing of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to a temperature below zero.
In spite of everything, all automation is left out as far as the small paste is concerned.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his teammates from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were an uncontrolled giant miniprimer.
"In all courses," says Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in a Complicated Situation
The European food safety authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with GM plants.
At present, this issue is formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, and another EFSA expert have also been hired for years at the Ilsi association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to Efsa’s testing standards for genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
Efsa’s provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with Ilsi’s situation documentation and mimic the deed of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that her side.
Recently, the Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Office for the Environment as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some from the industry, provided they are of a high and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA
It refers to itself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the commission of Lobby.
In this matter, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without researching food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?" he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a rule.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck maintains.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind me.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to knock down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart never was the same again: Thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing became debris.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He is enthusiastic: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he's smelled the smoke from cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tübingen in a former ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that came out of the demolition in Stuttgart.
“There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the garbage dump,” he says in his office, a wooden cottage that was once a guard’s cottage.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He spoke to the enemies of S21 for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the demolition.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram mass cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had purchased 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of impulse has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“Actually this stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political component."
He ascends to his all-terrain, makes a tour of his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
He is a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
Transport your treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the largest dealer of ancient stones in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstone stones chopped.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge," he explains.
Alba limestone, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Points a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Beautiful travertine."
Formerly the massifs belonged to the tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
All over in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police station, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, Heilbronner hospital tuff.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple rigging and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, not at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to make the stone dealer, in addition to stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man who takes advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be rescued.
Struggle of talents around great potentials
An active influx reigns in the buffet.
16 students crowd around the buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a sort of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Competing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a melee fight around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: to hire the most talented students of the universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labor market and are hired by others.
And since universities don’t provide publications about their students’ skills, they try to catch the eye on exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins over the talents.
A lady from the staff department handed out pens, rubber bands and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the excited young talents the internship programs and jobs for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
“In turn, VW can get to know students, look more closely at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are desired so directly.
“The main point was previously in the technical projects,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to advertise themselves and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students of the engineering disciplines are in an excellent bargaining position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineering positions in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this gap of engineers will grow even more.
At the audit and advisory firm KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of the talent hunt.
It organizes costly hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. the following year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election at the exit.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly struggling to pick and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey alone was short."
For the Dykta talent hunter the notes give results.
“To date we have a similar action in the last year with all participants.”
“Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, especially, small and medium-sized companies, classic with their work fairs.
"We try to get students at specialty fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, staffer for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company’s website.
"It is very difficult to fill the vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The teachers advise that you can do internships with us or carry out your theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium can't normally offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
When it comes to finding a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, childcare or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For this, he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the preconditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her ranking for her job seekers.
“I think the applicant looks especially at the external ratings of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the own staff.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” Kriegler says.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in recent years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby overturned its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new drillings remain prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What triggered this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that claimed the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce the U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of lawsuits.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, different peterole consortiums submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by employing tougher controls and tighter security regulations.
Currently the responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is reformed at the root.
Obama is also announcing that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortiums will be closed.
The industry is publicly announcing that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by advisory firm BDO - ahead of Wednesday's extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: “No one knows what exactly changes with regulation.”
Investments in new extraction projects are being prolonged for the time being, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is maroon oil, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude have shattered nature in Nigerian Ogonilandia.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the glow of lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that on the surface float brown spots of oil.
She used to pick shrimp in handfuls here, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland through a broken pipeline.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogonilandia, is considered to be one of the most stinking regions in the world.
Along the way the river runs through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat’s engine removes a brown broth, which, if you dip your hand in the water, will bring out a few full of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the palms that clash and hang their palms.
In vain flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of a previous paradise with a gas station smell expands into it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison proceeds.
The area of the Ogoni settlement has been a battleground for years: Here the first European explorers burst in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here the Shell consortium had to place its first factory in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
While they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred yards steel platforms stood out like quirky water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then a constant jet of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heads on the brink of breaking and leaky pipelines as the main culprits.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world conventional, reproached scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the rates of pipe defects are "over a greater multiple than elsewhere".
In a place, which from afar seems forgotten, appears an oil-filled workshop under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Between one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the drills, sometimes arbitrarily scattered over the ground, a fire blazes: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil heats up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce daily up to four 300-liter diesel barrels: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about $ 22.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the largest oil states in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of just 40 euro-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: Thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from “the bunkers,” which rigged the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this point at least 16 million liters of oil are lost per day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the stored provisional raw material is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best part in cisterns and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate as purely academic whether the environmental catastrophe is due to population management or the lax mode of production.
“If the oil companies did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no robberies, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the Ogoni are shattered mostly by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as the Chinese."
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular <0xC3><0x96>lmann.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If the special unit of the army catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This damn invention has completely shattered our country,” Akpobari said.
Investigators detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, investigators found a possible factory defect, which can produce “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers of the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much luckier than you can imagine: Australian aviation safety authorities perceived thanks to their investigations a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline is taking legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney that allowed for further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
On the engine mark they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas aircraft’s emergency landing, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Nevada Across the Country Causes Chaos in Traffic
All-white Germany: Overnight it has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Frosty temperatures were hit almost all over the country Thursday night, triggering chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snow removers are in continuous operation, removing the new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong wind gusts sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water levels 1.2 meters above their usual level on the Schleswig-Holsteins Baltic Sea coast.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There is partly 30 centimeters of newly fallen snow and strong cold winds swirl it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities reported major street disorders.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major upheavals are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the lanes or broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service took care of the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
At Germany’s largest airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokeswoman for Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The snow removers are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg because of the snowy streets: Also here a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, and the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
A 30-year-old woman also died after she overturned her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become more and more soft and dusty and therefore swirl in gentle streaks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be quite cold, in some places as much as 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank arranged its headquarters: Twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district were modernized; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the renovation, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims on the basis of a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale on the project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again," he said.
This is why Germany’s largest credit institution resigns from its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investor in a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms amounted to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed currently, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn the miners who died
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who gave themselves up for dead after many explosions at a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, as security measures remain precarious at the site of misfortune.
Nearly two weeks ago an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced to the site of misfortune, but discovered no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could go down for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family and friends remember the deceased with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining brightness of the sun in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They remain silent for two minutes.
In honor of the miners buried, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothing and surfboards.
Flags waved at half-mast in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the memorial event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose Zen son was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on November 19, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police superior Gary Knowles told reporters.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does gore fit into artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience will Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A imprisoned Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounding ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and rip his enemies the guts of their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no words during the entire film and the other characters are carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy Scotland’s beautiful and terrifying mountain scenery, which the backstage offers to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has multiple target groups it is a pity that they cannot be mutually discarded.
Director Winding Refn regards his savages and the trilogy about the drug-trafficking hairstyle “Pusher” as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with a little more mainstream humor or a little less of the house’s brutality.
A brain mass and sprouting guts cannot deter most fans of artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action will die of boredom, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts down there again.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, hides a piece of sometimes exciting cinema, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
There is no escape for the spectators.
Refn is just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a small blond young man, who supports Unojo faithfully, retains something like innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior out of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the devil's ambassador himself.
He represents doom, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
About midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that apparently the Syrians built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that exits the river.
According to information from the U.S. CIA’s international intelligence service at the end of April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the nearby El-Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs that showed the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
The reactor had recently been up and running, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely better known than then, the riddles grew bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but that it barely saw signs of a “nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several secret service operatives prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an "alleged reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor ahead, a senior U.N. diplomat responded in the summer lapidarily that the IAEA has “enough material to have questions.”
The Syrians quickly disposed of the rubble of the alleged “unused military building” and thoroughly cleared the ground.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by humans.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, of commercial vendors in the moments just after the attack, which must have a greater informative value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after particle analysis.
Damaskus has since refused to discuss the matter, as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, the controllers are forbidden a second inspection at el-Kibar and entry to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, the acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "progressively becomes a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place at the IAEA in Vienna, finally pending a serious violation against the treaty on the non-proliferation of atomic weapons, for which the IAEA watches.
The IAEA sees three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be “in functional connection” with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not publicly disclosed until now which teams are being treated, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interns, again derived from the vicinity of the towns located there.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with the satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria therefore prohibits entry to the three locations to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that Syrians fear a search that the U.S. has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert about the equipment thanks to the warnings of the US secret service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three sites and the cube to the bank of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be “related to fuel production.”
But there is “no sign of sensitive activities,” nor of uranium enrichment or refurbishment—processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should be subsequently separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargo trucks disappeared from the ground, no one has information on where the debris remains.
The IOAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometers from el-Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, unlikely, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of the satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show the Syrians made landslides at the three suspected locations and cleared large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has taken a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter does not have much urgency, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a kind of US ambassador is wielding the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish the controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, which should propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: It takes the majority of the IAEA Governing Council to do so, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "What if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in times of war
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her yet unnamed debut.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women’s associations have protested quickly, moving a few days of planned filming in Sarajevo to Hungary at the last minute.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
No love stories are given in the rape camps, and Jolie’s stance on the subject reveals the victims enough about the script.
Her organization in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly has Jolie written for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, granted a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go anyway.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she introduces herself with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content is still inaccurate.
The lovers were together before the start of the war and they meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the “rape victim falls in love with torturer” variant.
It is certain that Jolie’s film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
They can now make peace with the Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the net illegally, like many others previously.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon is finally good again for the Irish.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans shout for joy as the loud music rumbles, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the Southland Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, ping-pong balls to the glasses of beer from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong," and the prize for the winner is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 plus a few airline tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky drink game and the discreet computer doesn't really make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with it, to distract himself from the fulminant question, what the future holds for him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, “she got the job of her dreams as an event manager, maybe it’s a good sign,” says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predict economics experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin.
By 2015, there were 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, comes a wave of migration comparable to that suffered by the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, nowadays melancholy is spreading.
The economic crisis confuses above all the young, well-trained Irish, for whom so far, everything is uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes and loses our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students’ Union, sees a bleak future coming as the government only deals with montages and no longer offers prospects for young people.
“They cut minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to get new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
Observe how your peers go from unrecognized practices to the following ones.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
"For those who are starting to work, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," says the manager.
On his website there are photos of a boy practicing surfing in Australia and another practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not like working in galleys, but it entails freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish construction colleagues in Germany.
They now set up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January we go to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only rarely because he works overtime to pay for a home loan in Ireland.
“The situation is a bit crazy,” he says, as it’s been a long time since he first stepped on the threshold of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, which I've never been so good at."
He laughs a little embarrassed and leaves for cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with well-kept gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>380,000, 100 percent financed by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he hears often today.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in times spent here on the island,” he says.
“Working a season abroad isn’t the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leaving the future pending and simply seeing what life is like elsewhere.
He already worked for a couple of years in London, so why wouldn’t he and his girlfriend in New Zealand do well?
But these days there is one thing that worries him a lot: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
"Just, not too many emotions," he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Goodbye, sounds very distressing."
"We'd better call it a walk-in party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private companies.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it makes it possible to monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in a number of countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a sharp decline in production last year.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted their country’s Congress and 45 per cent their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only marginally increased in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32 percent.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents in Latin America cite crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
About 31 per cent say they or a close relative has been a victim of crime in the past year, down from 38 per cent last year and the lowest since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections in the trash
No one expected the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than foreigners feared trying to help the country get back on track.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballot papers were thrown in the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were “relatively good choices in many ways.”
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community stated, with caution, that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
All hopes have not yet been lost in relation to the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the vote to be invalidated.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has barely any support, if any, has moved on to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic is ravaging the country and more than one million of the earthquake survivors are still living in tents, a large abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And, as it has become clear, the Haitians themselves also think so.
Advancing on tiptoes towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernandez, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity index by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite everything, whether it can make it a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernandez puts aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was in the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened since Kirchner’s death from a heart attack on Oct. 27.
Some members of the Peronist movement in power have opposed Ms. Fernandez.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to next year, giving the President even more room for action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, place it at about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had the INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez now moderate these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentina’s agricultural exports around the world.
However, inflation has limited the growth momentum achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Ms. Fernandez is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fernandez is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not involve IMF oversight, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the prelude to the clean-up of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernandez wants to remain in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have waned.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not she will calmly repudiate many of her husband’s policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwanese voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of those eligible, came Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councilors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest shift in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to win the majority of votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has leaned towards full independence from Taiwan, won practically 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential elections, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the municipalities.
Typical elements of Taiwanese elections could be seen in the elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and light girls in dancing clothes.
Neither was the mysterious attempted murder of rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine if the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the shooting affected the election, sowing suspicion about the PDP and causing voters to lean toward the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not dealt with.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China’s military threat.
As a result, the KMT often avoids publicizing its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time also the PDP avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that his policy towards China had been confirmed to be acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue bribing them with trade, in line with its strategy to get Taiwan back into the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly like to achieve political integration too, but the first thing is the first thing.
It is best to wait for the 2012 presidential election to pass.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PDP is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been pleasantly welcomed as the PDP’s candidate for president, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything it can to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said the PDP candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intercession, the PDP will have difficulty choosing among its possible candidates.
The KMT should also do an examination of conscience.
Mr. Ma’s assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be due mainly to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says it will restructure its cabinet, as well as local teams.
The large samples from the PPD suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise pick in the Revelation Artist category.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bass player and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys’ surprises this year with a top-level nomination in the Best New Artist category.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination is thought-provoking, but respects the Grammys rules that he must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" undoubtedly made a breakthrough and, given his lightweight and enjoyable vocal style, as well as great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythms influences, he can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to Norah Jones's success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have lately stood in the category of jazz.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity,” an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Iyer's competitors include veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a roaring New Orleans favorite and regular guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise leans considerably toward fusion as on the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy's wild punk James Argue's Secret Society earned well-deserved recognition in the big band category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risking Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Director of Classical Albums
Classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
Major nominations went to Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," for piano and orchestra, five movements, and Steve Mackey for "Dreamhouse," an eclectic three-movement orchestral work.
Nominees with Southern California ties include Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories spanning orchestra, opera, choral and solo albums.
The Classic Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Ver Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; and "Sacrifice Cho and the Artistrati" of the various artists.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted South Wanderer" of the Orchester; and Arthur's "Walinsky" for "The Enchanted South".
Grammy-nominated composers for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for solo instrumental performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles-based composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral function category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the planning commission
The mosque project for Temecula has won the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it fosters terrorism and jamming.
However, the members of the commission decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'is, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud of it."
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
"They just speak very loudly."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was spent interceding for or against the center, roughly the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“The United States no longer exists,” reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
The plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near the ground zero area, the New York area where the September 11 attacks occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of nearly 135 families has been living together smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it demonstrates that it is possible for life to exist without the main elements they considered essential.
"This body has a dual capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, although it's close to being a really 'alien' kind of way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in Thursday's online edition of Science.
For a long time, it has been considered that there are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to drive their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be as fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, to put it somehow, traps the biochemical machinery,” Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they were able to adapt to and use to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but demonstrating that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form that uses arsenic may naturally exist, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be substituted for phosphorus is not new, but there has never been an example that proves it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth eras, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there could be other ways of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in ancient times," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Missing stolen dogs found in Compton
Two missing dogs have been found from the four stolen in front of the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke Corgis, went missing Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were spending the night in across the street from Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met late Wednesday night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They have returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is underway.”
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The dogs' owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit at local competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to be shown in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly two-month tour of dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their room window.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and they would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van robbery Tuesday at 6 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, as MGM’s restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally got the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to wipe out approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and TV shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal hurdles for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a small studio.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In reality, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument, to finance operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the firm began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to be able to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron President and bankruptcy recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors were seeking.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and disagreement, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially exits bankruptcy in the coming weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising $375,000 per month for their company management services, will receive a “successful fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production on MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on “The Hobbit,” along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 percent of MGM’s debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep its gift budget balanced
While the iPad is the top candidate to be this year’s most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 Play-Doh cans.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known of their kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And toys powered by button batteries are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and older) are guinea pig-sized stuffed toys that sing a note when their bellies are tightened.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start to squeeze, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-change games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar pass, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheels with locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you’re an 80s kid, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and over), with a backpack full of question letters designed to turn a car ride into a session with an autocorrecting exercise notebook occurring.
If you are wary of giving your child his smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60, ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although games don’t teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, ages 3 to 12), it’s the first major fine tuning of the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a game of five blocks barely larger than a box of matches, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to assemble words by putting the blocks in line before time runs out; it’s formidable for an improvised word-making competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, ages 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle on your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the latest in a line of button cell-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.

A more moderate side of law enforcement is being promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin stepped into a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, China’s corpulent urban order policemen, feared and despised for their capricious energetic measures and propensity for violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of viewers.
"Firm!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence in white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly lined black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white striped bows.
“Personally, I think they look normal,” Mr. Tang said, dismissively.
“The models are beautiful.”
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a blue supposedly more attractive.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a dysfunctional snack cart, and watched it frowning constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, expressly chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, feminine side.
Sadly, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s insignificant respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat to death a passerby after using his cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and posted online, describing how to effectively flog criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street vendor suffered brain damage after a brawl with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar on the government,” lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded “a really meticulous cleaning.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district solicited through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features."
They should have a height above average, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said the work was too physically arduous for women over the age of 25.
“Your image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
“First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.”
Then comes the temperament “and the inner qualities.”
Female chengguans are like vases, he said, adding, “beside being vases, they will have other responsibilities.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to endorse that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job postings for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
Whether this means being handsome is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not be presented.
“We can’t allow a lame person or a humpback to come and work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, with his red cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t believe the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His co-worker with dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said “Our work should present the image of the city.”
They also don’t oppose their time-bound work, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply driving salespeople into the alleys where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many buns or bowls of tofu as possible before being dumped.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
“We’ve told you many times!” said Ms. Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn cart with noodle toppings.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is pretty much the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare time.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, mutinied after a false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For now Xindu has avoided such violence.
Calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorbike shouted rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, made their way through the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 and older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said naturally.
“Most of the time it’s the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
The senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Sen. John Ensign of criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said it was "certainly pleased" with the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to charge him with this matter.”
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal criminal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, get lucrative work through lobbying, in order to silence Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared to disagree with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to drop the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid procedural misconduct charges.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s top lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to bring charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins declined to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I’m not comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we thought they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got work through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign chief of staff John Lopez contacted Hampton and told him that he was “crushing” the Home Office over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, she said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department’s lead and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is eager to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the courtroom rows.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the appalling testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is poised to come to an official end, with the death penalty judge’s imposition voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed court filings outlining the arguments for appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reporting on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such a widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“Based on what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Hayes’ senior defense attorney.
Trial Judge Jon C. Blue of the State High Court laconically dismissed the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media was “carefully monitored” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that coverage of celebrated cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the TV show and film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the way he communicated from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
“There is a general concern about the impact of new media” on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied Connecticut’s death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many themes outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge improperly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and had improperly pressed for a verdict over his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process may attract most of the interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually threw firewood into the fire of emotion about the case.
“The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state.”
His attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly, was a ludic vision that would make the court’s policy on controlling coverage weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often drawn to arguments about adaptation that were required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would demand that new media require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century.”
Can civility build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign of invective and negativity, a bit of civility has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of genuine bipartisan cooperation in the future or an illusory moment before a swift return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the major issues that must be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what they all say, it was at least a polite discussion of the two sides’ differences, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than just another empty episode for partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a probationary period, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That’s why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deeply entrenched to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which then go extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can’t pretend they’re in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START nuclear disarmament pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
"After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontational one," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civics can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The motives have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and overturn the new health care law.
Those lines of bias are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting expenses.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forced the issue of deficit onto the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among elected officials on the panel, suggesting that on fiscal issues there are, at least currently, few grounds or desires for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in battles between White House Republicans and those in Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama over budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who feels they are losing will likely change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are currently larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a “cleptocracy,” leaving a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service reportedly operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical authority,” takes its share as money climbs the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several lawsuits for libel over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian TV channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he claimed: "It's crazy, it's a hoax, it's a nuisance."
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government," the statement said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term from the criminal world and the mafia that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that transcends the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
“The SFS, the MVD and the militia are at the second level.”
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS raises money from the largest companies, and that police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s commercial owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, the protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, said in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur until late at night Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that claimed U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he cared for his people,” said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as “the Butcher” for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations-Cambodia joint court issued the first sentence of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can do nothing,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“This is creating divisions within families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the foot soldiers remained poor and unskilled farmers.
“These people have made little profit after the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the regime’s utopian agrarian ideology.”
“They were raised without any concept to do business.”
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating herself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine,” he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
“But now life is difficult because we have to self-supply.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
During a recent hot afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden piles on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the court summoned her, she would not show up.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to the Khmer, is to reconnect the broken pieces," he said.
“It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a bunch of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the roadside, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to Pol Pot’s last resting place, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to relinquish its stockpile of uranium qualified for weapons
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations with Belarus were carried out in the past two months, to remove 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for weaponry from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday’s agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the Nuclear Security Summit in 2012.”
“This shows that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapon-qualified uranium) and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million for the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the low-enriched uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that “this was very carefully coordinated and orchestrated to strengthen trust” that led to the deal signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapon-qualified uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential easing.
It was stated that "while progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish government had no qualms about CIA flights
The Spanish government had no qualms about CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners bound for Guantánamo over Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance on foreign planes that cross Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, there was a meeting between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no qualms about intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “snatched off guard,” Aguirre recounts on a cable.
Also the then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest profile possible, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity to influence".
For his part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not try to block the initiative of the judge to ask for the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on the flights of the CIA.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern about “apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors,” rather than declassified information from the CNI or the Defense Ministry.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba told him that "although the Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses concern about the PP’s action in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” he said.
The confessed parricide complained in the network of the "agobium" of being a mother
The young woman was talking about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror a la gallega"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which he used from a young age, he communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natives of Noia, the town of A Coruña from which she is a native.
The messages are from 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their romantic life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician, 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
It lasted a year.
When they left him, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get a DNA test.
It wasn't long before he met another boyfriend.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little one stayed with his partner, who even went to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But from the contents of the communications, it is seen that their romance fractured, that they broke up.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and mosqued, because I have come to work."
"When I told him it was okay, but of course, now he realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
Then, he talks about a message to the phone he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child to you."
She complains: “If you don’t like me leaving the child with my mother, I’ll pick him up when I get back,” he claims.
In May, he talks about returning to his village: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up for a job so I don't miss it."
He clarifies that if everything goes well for him, he takes his firstborn.
"He's going to be with whoever he owes, that is, with me, and never in life will it occur to me to leave him again with anyone but my mother," he said.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it, the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly killed on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
"César is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He's going there (the kid) for some summer classes, and so I save a little bit of kangaroo paste."
The 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck."
The 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes so that he can learn Catalan."
From Víctor, his current partner, there is one: “He advances me money.”
On the internet there are posts on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he called himself "Muki the Excarcerator."
"Terror in Galicia (epigraphe) ".
The last man who lived with her, a juror, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that it all happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered yesterday the provincial penitentiary of Palma, coming from the center of judicial detainees of Menorca.
The lawyer ex officio, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "nor had any intention of causing harm to the minor."
Before, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and experienced deputies in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has its eyes on the general elections because, whether advance or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes this formation obtains in these elections usually double that it receives in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the regional elections of 2006, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would confirm that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would stay with one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its replacement at the head of the Diputación de Barcelona, one of the administrations that handles the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popular agree on the possibility of the PSC losing the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Girona, where the socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be foolish for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it needs to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can lead the upheaval in the Tarraconense capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has stood only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commission of the Police in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Land Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the latter person responsible for the bombings in Bombay in 2008.
The Interior Ministry has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of assuring that with "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus has been "weakened" at the international level and, "therefore, its operational capacity".
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy so that its “combatants” can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence that in the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the territory of the EU will be carried out in the coming days similar to the one developed last night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another operation was carried out in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistanis Bukaner Zehan and Butat Athar.
These were the ones who directed from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole tourists passports that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
According to media reports, at the moment, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay bombing, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
Police have seized a large amount of documentation.
The PP demands Mas to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispensing with pro-sovereignty adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the ecuador.
The president of the Catalan people attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the security that gives to have obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the vote of investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the talks that these days Mas maintains with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture "you will have to park all the sovereignist and independence speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be taken care of, by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a harsh opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Catalan Solidarity).
The geriatrician says that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that his caretaker killed more than 11 elders
The managers of the geriatric La Caritat of Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage that has caused to the institution the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while he was there killed at least eleven elderly people in his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the wish of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials."
In addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the caretaker, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ relatives are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by phone.
La Caritat, through its director, strongly denied yesterday this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what has happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is not a single indication that there has been an imprudent action by any person other than the defendant himself."
The already christened "Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that he committed with the help of a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to medicines.
Insulin punctures and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his quest to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the tests that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila is not lying and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credence to the manifestations of the caretaker, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that he is superior, and they justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say that they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to yesterday’s threat from Trichet that warned “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral spreads have closed sharply and European bank shares have risen more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely recovered, which is a worrying sign.
What has happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses recovers but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose the fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the ones that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded to end the public debt purchase plan for ineffective and eliminate all extraordinary measures of liquidity in the term and leaving only unlimited access per week.
In the wake of the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue with their bond buying program and even signal the intensification of it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As in their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even contemplated buying bonds and the markets collapsed, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May it announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday it said it had already bought a lot, causing a new crash in the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued $500 million at 5.28%, versus $750 million at 4.81% from the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment behind Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, figures from the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and they have until February to raise private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease tensions ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December where a political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of Beethoven’s anthem of joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity when he presented yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The dual Trichet and ZP effect explains why the Spanish stock market has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been quick and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Aid would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available three times than in March, at very expensive rates and closes you access to the sine díe markets.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "besides being, it must appear."
Cheer up, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the junta of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not mitigate the open conflict in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "null and void", the judicial board of El Juniper next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are tuning the legal drumming for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services to the company does not seem willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Juniper.
He was detached from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors at the shareholders’ meeting on January 18 of this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Mercantile Registry.
The judicial board of El Juniper for next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the board.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants their five children to, through procedural wit, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, try to validate and sanitize the radically null junta of January 18," according to its official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for, once the meeting is held, to proceed to its challenge, considering that it is "null and void of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to get the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, claims usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive question to be decided by the judge once the hearing on the application for impeachment is held, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software designs real-time car improvements.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first nobody took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone bet on the victory of Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari.
Without disregarding the skill as a driver of the eventual champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the high car competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to design assembly lines of manufacturing plants around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most celebrated commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the bolides.
The manager of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull cars with the exception of the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be taken from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this madness of technological refinement is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its cars in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secrecy".
The team for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, are hidden other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety null.
The factory’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in trucks contributed 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds up to 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computers as "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP to open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will combine this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the refurbished store located on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP Personal Systems also said that the philosophy for installing the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, care, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving possible problems of HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects to a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets to 'steal' one million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war on liabilities.
Despite this, it anticipates a drop in interest margins, which will be partly offset by higher commissions and higher credit prices.
Sabadell expects to attract one million private customers in three years, its outstanding subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new master plan that will have a validity of three years.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted -, its great pending subject, since until now it had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks in these times dare to set goals and make them public since the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its master plan Optima, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made that it will extend it one more year.
Customers who miss savings banks will be their main target.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and momentous" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the war on liabilities – which penalizes margins – is being reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and banks are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity are already moving to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a pressure factor on credit.”
"We have not closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave orders to its network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads -see CincoDías on November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now “is to raise commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
“Next year everything will move,” he said.
He claims that capital needs are "high" and does not rule out any Spanish financial institution entering red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds in the face of new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis has become less important.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which cushions the crisis.
ECSC ruled out a second wave of mergers in the cash registers
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being executed.
When the process of concentration of Spanish savings banks began, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol to the Civic Banking group can not be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in that as well," said the director.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Managers and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the concentration process is being undertaken "at the highest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is occurring in the deadlines that in his day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
“Passing from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion asset volume to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "is going at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banks did very well in the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have prompted a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with maintaining the old traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to transgressor countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans for fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended the Greek bailout decision.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very much against the bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should assist in the process of reform of the Union that will make those measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which he may not agree very much, from that date on the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which offending countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is telling us that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The envite is clear.
And we would do wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What is required of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquility.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity that they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with the big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home has opened its way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t look like they’re going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, the possibility of leaving an overcrowded monetary zone of unreliable countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and Law Fraud
Stunts like those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but no willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly wrought by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with a few minutes remaining to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in taking fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and can pass clean of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned with two matches the team's coach, José Mourinho, and with different financial amounts the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and that in past occasions has fined its players for analogous acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative coach.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulations contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud of law; for, indeed, they are actions respectful of the sports regulations, but they seem to evade their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that the sports spirit comprises is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets alluded to with fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as trap or law fraud, because his violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but precisely his action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders gain in the intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to verify that the opponent is not placed at a disadvantage nor is profit obtained in the same match, since obviously the result of the action involves leaving the team itself with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated at the first change, and also with this performance the players fulfill a sanction game and move to the second card cycle, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, going through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor making the most of what the rules allow.
In this case, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is fuzzy, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture the Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for the days 16 and 17.
The self-funded celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, are proliferating.
Like the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December, the pre-Christmas group dinners also return, which continue to act as an oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the business associations and the interviewers agree.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year’s calendar (at the fall of New Year’s Eve on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (on the 16th and 17th) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean cow stage began, many companies have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to dispense with the tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer’s representative, to this day, does not dare to predict how this month’s festivities will be.
"People think about it a lot before they book."
"He wants to leave but has the alerts lit on the issue of prices," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the band around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey of several central establishments found the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the pretension of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
In AN Grup, which is headquartered in El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting a turnover boom since the second half of the year and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group emphasize that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas one, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green buds in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, hopes to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reservations are "animated", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Of course, the illusion for the celebrations has not descended, pay whoever pays, it indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises serious concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at “a faster pace than any other country.”
WikiLeaks leaks confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns raised in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Aside from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of U.S. diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on atomic security, instead of going up, “decreases,” and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
As Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson puts it in a report ahead of then-National Security Advisor James Jones’ visit: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumoured dispersion of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given falling educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The novelty of the documentation leaked by Julian Assange’s portal is the ever-decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which called communication with Pakistan "frustrating," said: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also urged Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistani army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
The Chase of the WikiLeaks Chief
Obama appoints a senior counter-terrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol is issuing a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and track the movements” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Also, it is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Mark Stephens, the lawyer for WikiLeaks’ creator, said: “Police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
It was on the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
All 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange “in view of his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization, do consider the so-called free-way notification network to proceed with an arrest - which must be undertaken by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder has been willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, whom they compare to the mythical Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange is still unknown, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview with Time magazine’s editor via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the U.N. in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman’s attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with views proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will preside over the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and its funds and pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or help."
Still further has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying Assange should “be killed.”
“Obama should make it a target and use a drone or something.”
Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a potential presidential candidate, did not apologize.
“Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too gentle a punishment,” he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to bypass the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north by the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his covert resignation is insufficient for those affiliated to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can not cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to win over the new critics with winks that allow him to arm himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councillors of ERC will be able to pronounce on its continuity in secret.
By ballot, not by hand.
If the carodistas want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that neither would be good a result "to the Bulgarian".
Those close to Carod demand more from the president than putting his position at the disposal of militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But as they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the elaboration of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
Its intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to advance the congress to autumn 2011, something that the summit already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” undermines stability and that its goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash dirty rags from doors inward.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the acting councilor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovation took for granted that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he lists five, of which two stand out.
The first, to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assemblyism at once as a working mechanism.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the turbulent 2008 conclave left the task to the leadership of reviewing the assembly at a specific statute reform congress.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged dealing with the matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to pick it up and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are the murder of three women and the discovery of a pair of bodies cut off in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases stands out that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the shot of grace in the head in addition to the wired feet and hands.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street, in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday morning, Ejidatarios found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the highway of quota Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the section that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was found a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was shot dead by eight bullets after leaving his house to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a bullet in the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the forehead was found the corpse of a man in a lonely road of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body they found a bumped cap of firearm caliber 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the blackwater canal of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the other body members, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a corpse that was in the Peña Colorada area, which was tied with his hands backwards and with his head bandaged.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda district in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two death warning messages.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found dead in the town of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning was located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Ríos according to a message that his executors left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the back of the head, the dead body of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman’s skin were detected tattoos of the Holy Death, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the latter part of the month, the body of a man was found aboard a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with their heads wrapped up and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said: “This happens to those who do not align.”
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied feet and hands, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Colonia Juárez.
Next to him the officers found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its emission of greenhouse gases.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said his country has made huge efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this issue.
He said China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the approval last year of a new Energy Law, which sets out the objectives set out in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
In China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multi-annual plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are in progress or have already been concluded.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficient Use Program, which was implemented over the past five years and which received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent bulbs by savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years, and plans to do so again by 2020.
Attached to the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former Panist leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former Panist leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is his right.
In an interview prior to the taking of protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sound Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to go, if necessary, through a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional will emerge strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
“That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was a local election approach that was successful and met the goal,” he said.
The Panist leader said that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary, we enjoy it and strengthen us," he said.
He said the council will no doubt know how to elect the best or the best leader who requires National Action for the next three years, hence it will hand over the courier "to whomever the council determines."
"I have that absolute peace of mind and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the rebound the party recorded in the last elections on July 4 will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence that "a lot of hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations."
When questioned about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during the four years of his government, César Nava called on the PRIists to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; let them start defending them; let them get out of the closet," he said.
He opined that the head of the federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, much less censorship.
Obama promotes law for undocumented students on Twitter
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call on your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call on your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps an open cyber link to a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with the senators, given that the legislation’s vote is imminent.
“With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he said.
The message came after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation unless the Bush-era extension of tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said that once the fiscal issue is resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the bills.
"I think there's a long time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
“I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a “debate closing vote” for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on as of next Thursday in the Senate, though it is more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years, and have entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the bill, requiring the support of a handful of Republicans, as supporters of the bill lobbied intensely to ensure the bill passed.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
Supporters of the Dream Act therefore require several Republicans to join in should other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martinez’s term.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have said they will not back it on another occasion.
Another Republican he supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of Language was a walk where the participants showed off the narration
"I understand that of El sexo en la lengua, but... ¿el dedo en la llaga? ¿qué se espera de mí?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of Los placeres de la lengua, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to El sexo en la lengua).
The finger in the sore... "puts us in trouble," the Argentine writer gently puffed out to the public, mostly young people, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "plague" is, goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not get answers although she does get clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectologist is convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my sore".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the open real and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very caught.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also exposed a delightful narrative that he titled Elogio de la invención, where the finger in the sore is not named but at one point is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress, who also played clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to speak then America, the great novel that was not lacking from the beginning its own chroniclers who told it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what happened.
Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told with imagination that was lacking even in modesty.
However, he stressed "it is the madmen and the deceivers who best imagine" and it is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that what is narrated belongs to one side or another, where fictional literature reaches its apogee.
He actually calls it the "Cervantine tradition."
“By his inheritance we are what is told.”
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero pointed out and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger in the sore.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers towards the great scourge of social violence that crosses her country – and shares Latin America – product of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer committed to the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
“To be masters of our thinking and to be masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times putting your finger on the wound and disturbing those people who are much more comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and disturbing also the powers that prefer a black and white world,” he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting himself with the medal of the runner-up, has been one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he was in charge of Morelia with which he fell 4-2 overall to Toluca; subsequently, in Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-1 overall and it was precisely to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team ended tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he put himself in front by 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three players of his failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4th turn.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come to me, but the above is the most important thing," said the helmsman when questioned about the numbers against him playing finals.
Very current has the previous final, of which, he says, has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were ready to run and I think that is a lesson, until the game is finished we can celebrate ".
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty shootouts, something that does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to get to the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we did a bad move the fate, but sometimes waited for us that was not the final nerves or anxiety to have the title.
Romano has in his hands to stop being a technical runner-up and prove for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals should go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be less and the waiting time will be less.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will be required to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASCs) prior to their interview at the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, among which are:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa-on-demand cases (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section, will remain in this less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA to announce discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency cited the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery Thursday that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," sparking speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that creatures exist alongside us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that "yes there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at Thursday’s press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia y Patrón 'bloco' opositor
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' in the Chamber.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'throned' against the reform to the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it initiates 'bipartisanship', because now it will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms in an institutional way constitutes the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the coming days they will talk with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be enslaved again by both parties and with this the opposition coalition is over.
“This is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and for this reason they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress after having been monopolistic, now be "duopolitical."
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipathism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are conversing with other colleagues to be more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress has become a 'loot' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
“It used to be just one game, now they’re splitting it between two.”
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That not by cupular agreements, leave out 5 that we probably will make 9 deputies, now the five that see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for the "provider"
Another check is paid by Mazatlan City Council to the disputed owner of an electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the company of electrical material, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200,000 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and, consequently, how many more checks are missing to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, you’re just being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter on November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as marked by the Law when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using their services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after on July 25, Northwest published a review of the cheques issued by the City to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the City more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he cashed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urge to attend tourist sites
Tourist businessmen regret foreign tourist accident due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and benches has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the clutter and take it back to nearby businesses.
"Politicians do not know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea how much money is lost, or else they would not do the works in this way in such a long time and without proper planning."
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so because giving preventive maintenance and not only fall into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be given maintenance, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Mazatlan Shield and the Venadito.
"Today, for tourists to come, it does not depend solely on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are tourist attractions," he said.
"Due attention has not been given and this type of facts highlights something that is notorious to everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that it is urgent to rescue tourist sites in Mazatlan, because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned up and put online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Call for IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that deputies take on the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A legislature of decent work and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday the 60th legislature was installed, composed of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergencia and one more of the PVEM, which adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly inaugurated 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to watch over their own interests and become carnival comparsas of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that bring forward the Governor in turn.
"We take care that they come to do a dignified job and above all committed to society and with the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation.”
As for tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight that he plays within the state budget to strengthen the state Secretary of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generator of foreign exchange and investment and that it directly competes with agribusiness."
In addition, it is required to label resources for detonating tourism projects that help provide security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a wizarding king
Dolls, carts and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For her parents, the next King’s Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabella, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Balthazar will give them the toys and clothes they desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the Salvador Allende Colony and live up to date because the father has no fixed job.
“Sometimes we find it hard because my husband doesn’t have a cabbage, but we sell mandarin and potato ... in the afternoon I go out with the ‘pebes’ to sell on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a monster car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests sized clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said 'let's see son', because it was very expensive," recalled sadly Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, is missing tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the Seeking a Wizard campaign by donating a toy or cash at the Northwest Reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been detained who will face various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have come after a long investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
“It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to carry out the arrests,” Mr. Ruel said.
This police operation involved about seventy officers from the Estrie de la Sécurité du Québec investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
It will be possible to fight illegal migration without problems
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should solve the problem of smugglers loaded with illegal migrants, will surely face strong opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I mainly rely on the Charter."
“I am here with a party that has created the granite you are stepping on,” said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not support the bill because it targets the wrong target.
"We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government does," Duceppe said.
The NDP’s immigration critic, Olivia Chow, has bluntly rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against those in charge of the smugglers’ homes and that’s what we want with another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would request a vote so that each deputy who would oppose would then explain himself to his electors.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest had been announced, numerous observers continued to call for the establishment of a commission of public consultation on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday’s announcement caught more than one by surprise.
It can be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police services of Quebec held last October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for Quebec party critic Stéphane Bergeron to call the announcement “a rabbit out of the box” and “a last-minute sloppy solution.”
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ president Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace launching a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest insists on avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,” he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggests Quebec grant a special mandate to the intervener general to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the intervener general,” he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent gang is not the only budding project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the operation Spring 2001 related to the groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed for the passage of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations add to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme in the Laurentians, and of the Chêne in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, 10 residences have been evacuated.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several tracks, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, security adviser Annik Bouchard said.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Center, meanwhile, issued announcements Wednesday communicating the strong floods of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assumption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Dupont is partially to blame.
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CBSC) over controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians, as well as his rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who committed suicide, do not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Quebec Common Front of People Receiving Social Assistance.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were incorrect.
Presenters should report reliable data and not one that leads to deception.
Regarding suicide, the featured Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life ' s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a sensitive subject in an equitable and appropriate manner."
In this respect, therefore, any blame has been dismissed.
The latest litigation concerned statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure if the needy were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the radio station CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of highest audience within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and thai box, climbs the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the ground-based game of mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security officer and as an employee of the company UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championships, held from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won in the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he explained.
“I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China.”
“They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four places in the last world championship in each category.”
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“The interesting thing is that I’ve been progressing in every competition.”
“At this point, I’ll be the first one this time or next year!”
San shou or sanda is a discipline originally from China in which it is allowed to strike with fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
Clashes are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has to maintain a competition in his career, he will undoubtedly attend the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
“This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China,” explains the friendly boy.
“It’s like the equivalent of the Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).”
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“The one who has won me is a real professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face each other in the final of their category."
“Then the champions in each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu.”
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without prior tender the most important contract, the project management contract, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following the decision of Hydro-Québec to entrust to the private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.”
“In other words, people, instead of doing it in secret, are now doing it openly,” Quebec Party MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there had been any collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, saying the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "lack of rigor."
He pointed out that "the least" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, this is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortia formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of the consortiums in the technical advisory sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at the Quebec trade register identifies more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, the company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to a particular workforce dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
"If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
“You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory deal and at a good price.”
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Genivar 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449.783,344, including the Énergie gérance contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has implied that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "fund" it, before specifying that it is more about their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade brands or organic certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse: the consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption are pulverized, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows down their commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of the same, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates that carry the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are "eco-responsible", notes the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently supported by about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the questionable nature of the information cause 46% of consumers to discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers also say they are suspicious of the supposed returns of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in stores in their neighborhood and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points out of a maximum of 100 this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to take the place of the king of recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness seems to be outside the doors (of your car): in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or have shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only by means of a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who were hoping for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to repurchase from Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return it to its true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan whose amount would, in fact, be lower than the initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected an initial action plan and a $12.8 million application last spring, but applications have since been revised downward.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, submitted a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation should be completely discarded.
Recall that the Quebec Association of Cinema Owners and Film Complexes opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do call for considerable financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has for ten years carried the burden of the auteur cinema in its premises of the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent film theaters is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The company Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are for their part promoting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $ 700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to screen films on eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, screening Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of complex Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. sees as the Canadians’ complex with respect to the Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter’s feeling of superiority to Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable from September 22, 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, tells how far the United States does not enter into the issues debated by the political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins gives some explanations of this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex virtually inherent in Canadians when it comes to dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Accordingly, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this choice: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more so, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.”
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, the Ottawa business manager, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, whereby Canada will for the first time record a deficit in the last decade due to a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan,” wrote Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties conditioned their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image conveyed by the drama series broadcast on CBC in the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which unsubtle references are made to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that, during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to host some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that it depended "on each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote “has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods have warmed in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate before 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of concrete major projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluorescent compact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to lower global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should still be decreased to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from spiraling out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced even more than twice.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above all, they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have expressed reservations about compact fluorescent bulbs, as they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the main source of mercury emission on the planet are not compact fluorescent bulbs, but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted by incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it $2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast Eagerly Expects Election Results Announcement
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, given that the deadlines set have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“Calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission has allowed Wednesday's deadline to pass midnight without the results being released, three days after Sunday's poll.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CIS had told television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, demands have multiplied in the world for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo's side counts on the Constitutional Council's annulment of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'etat of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said the FN's intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has deemed the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that submitting a complaint to the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have been the icing on the cake for the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned Ivory Coast’s political class that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in continental territory (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the seasonal variations (CVE) provisional published Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data of the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the active population in continental territory and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but want to work, whether or not they are available within two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people present in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points both in three months and in one year), that is, 482,000 people over 50 years of age, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with the DOM.
Unemployment has been stable only among people aged 25 to 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The INSEE has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a manager of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influences and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions that the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
“It’s easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it’s another matter to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client’s appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night, they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their close relatives, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done is deal with the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to counsel Simon.
As part of this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, has also been under investigation since Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but he has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
“The investigating magistrate took into account the explanations and released him,” said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday they interrogated four other people and released them, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged with “influence trafficking and passive corruption”.
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "theft and embezzlement of public goods by a person dedicated to the public service" and for "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “cover-up of abuse of social goods.”
Among the people who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect that their societies have served to launder the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation notes that the investigations focus especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: The Elysee has exaggerated Syria’s mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for “espionage”, has been in the grip of the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee has explained its strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice on managing their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not come in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detainee in France and wanted by US justice for smuggling materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram drawn up on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage-taking cases".
The Elysee Councillor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speak with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held by force in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continuously release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release.”
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often.”
Because, once the attempts at negotiation by discrete channels have been exhausted, "silence will solve nothing", the Iranians are "experts in delaying maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day on which she will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment of the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he points out that the Elysee anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is being disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a decision of a judge.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is looking into Iran’s clandestine material procurement networks for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that it was not so.
The Elisha, he says, not only “has he been greatly surprised by the judge’s decision,” but he has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot annul the decision" judicial, he comments.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysee councilor dials a phone number, hangs up and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee does not shy away from efforts, uses statements and organized “leaks” in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influenced” role of “mediator”.
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and see that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the reason for such “gratitude” towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks?
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what Syrians have actually done.”
Next, the document discusses the reasons that have led the Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The major communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria," he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded premature and undeserved".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris tries to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confides to him: "of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we thanked him."
“At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an “active role in the liberation of our compatriot.”
Starting at midnight, young Koreans can’t play online
The South Korean government is going to adopt a so-called “Cinderella” law that will prevent teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study in school and lead a normal life during the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, ministerial official in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of the young people so request, the official added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appoints the host countries
Amid the storm sparked by corruption suspicions, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can come to take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional stronghold of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of his country, cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has highlighted three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The head of government hopes to remake the coup successfully carried out by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had succeeded in 2005 in organizing the 2012 Olympics for London.
Will this intense activity be enough to regain England’s brilliance against the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to their ready-made stadiums, their experience (82 World Cup in Spain, Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial outlook of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, which has become a major outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“They’re pulling out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems the most logical favorites.
The world's leading economic powerhouse and home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that jointly organized the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of chances by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle was in doubt.
Mitterrand had implied that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubts.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One commandment in the Elysium leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not go well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that there is doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, even if they didn’t believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that he didn’t rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the UMP deputies, Tuesday night at the Elysee, the possibility of "two terms" has caused some stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not at all.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He was simply transmitting the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he speaks of the presidential elections, with a joking tone, in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about what's coming next."
His statements of the day before yesterday do not bring him any closer to the candidacy, nor less.
There are comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has risen to the forefront that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Quite the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is obvious is what leads many PS people to demand that the battle be organized earlier than planned.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the issue," the Prime Minister's environment has reacted immediately and prudently.
"If he thinks he can lose, he won't be a candidate," Raffarin said.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain acquisitions of government bills
The last meeting of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Board of Governors this year should make it possible to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that are expected to end by the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will no doubt not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in favor of resolving the debt crisis of European states.
He did not want to say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its purchase program of state bonds.
“I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans.”
On the eve in Brussels, during his hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the program of buying State Letters in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will keep its main unchanged rate at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds doubled last week to close to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased bonds worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt in the slightest that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not anticipate any significant changes in direction.
Although over-three-month lending operations have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended today for a few months.
"I can't imagine it's going to significantly alter your program."
"If not, it would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011,” anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
- Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of such bonds in order for the market to remain stable", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked increase in the yields paid by the most fragile states," said a major bond manager.
Because, if interest rates go up in the clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi’s government has weathered the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "undecipherable" and that a weekend was expected "unpredictable", statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of the hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a certain stir in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" about "market turmoil" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, their problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a jug of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, neither in the short nor in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, ed.), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are smaller than those required from other countries,” said Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis would be opened.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to fight the crisis
Christine Lagarde said: “I think we have already shown on Sunday night and by day that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone.”
Although it was relative, the easing recorded yesterday in the bond rates of European states has boosted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
Rating agency Standard & Poor's said it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target in current speculation.
“As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems,” the economists at Exane BNP Paribas said.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.”
Aware of this gap and the dangers it conceals, European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen existing mechanisms for exiting the crisis.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly sets the stage.
The first issues of EFSF securities are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in the funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the frontline countries, Portugal and Spain, these are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to the austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before applying their own budget corrections and deciding on structural reforms they deem essential to build confidence on a lasting basis.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, finally, consider the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the public bond markets.
While in Paris on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe that an additional amount of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would suffice, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The instrument for this is the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which is currently endowed with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A piece of advice that could certainly be examined in detail by European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions are getting worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, 24 departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen since Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects northern Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France and Limousin.
The snows are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles, have been banned from access to several departmental roads.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that you do not drive except in case of necessity and the circulation of certain TER vehicles has been banned during the day.
On Thursday, school transport in Picardy was banned.
No specific measures were planned Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday because of the expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France has reached its peak, billions have been raining.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the $23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that the Société du Grand Paris must build.
To initiate this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
On a theoretical level, this sum will be the one that will subsequently allow SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The 2010 Corrigendum Finance Act, examined at the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of an equipment excise tax and the increase of the tax on offices in the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in figures: "The proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists “to modernize it, increase its product and allocate that increase to the Société du Grand Paris”.
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from $4 billion.
"It is specified that the fiscal resources are added to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", we can read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
“From the moment income is created, we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the $4 billion later, as we explain.”
"It will be recorded in the budget and used as needed."
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the $4 billion promised is not included in the credit, can provoke a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that every dossier created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news from public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucian) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The whistleblower is lazy, just as the head of the secret services (if he could not be, what do I know, editor of Libération) is lazy (or has little appetite), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the U.S. embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as that published in Newsweek the week before.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since the Second World War and since the heads of states can call each other on the phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have been transformed into espionage centers.
Any spectator who watches research films knows it perfectly, we just pretend that we don’t know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker could consult the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country considerably affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "slayers".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, he could be conceived in full power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the citizen’s avenger) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power endure that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has done a lot to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any confidential information on the network, since it would be like posting it on a poster in the middle of the street.
But it’s also clear that, with current technologies, you can’t expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state has traveled by plane and made contact with one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is a matter of science fiction and, therefore, novel, but I imagine government agents who travel discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by heart or, at most, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently advances like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has once again created a cable telegraph (telephone).
Videotapes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, uncovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digitals) only allow to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travel it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques lead us back to the horse-drawn carriages.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was secretly planned in the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: France's turmoil in its pledges of funding
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked (called fast start or early) funding pledges made by developed countries have been honoured.
And the French dumps have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best cards to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The operation transparency was an appreciable result and was appreciated for what it really is worth: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track to meet its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be “new and additional” to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what “new and additional” means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Nowadays, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken as its reference the year 2009: international financing is maintained and 150 million are added over three years as fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references to the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" of the year 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditures of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
Specifically, France’s total amount of aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while purporting to respect its commitment to “new and additional” funds.
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no norm and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to one euro donated.
Evidently, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that is to be recovered as equivalent to one euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan for the country that grants the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be computed for its commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it for yourself.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to fulfill its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, it manages to give the impression that it spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional", as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a relatively short-term minutiae in relation to the whole of the climate negotiations.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could push forward the debates on the stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently being debated): we will not get rid of the question of "additional character" or the method of computing loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have hope for the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingested 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a statistically significant value considering the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that usually consume a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These meals taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as the treats, were examined in the laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually are not exceeded, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is of concern," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil and intended as a school snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in the food, where the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even breadstick or gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the slice of salmon was the most “nutritive” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk these “pollutant cocktails” pose to the consumer “is probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
