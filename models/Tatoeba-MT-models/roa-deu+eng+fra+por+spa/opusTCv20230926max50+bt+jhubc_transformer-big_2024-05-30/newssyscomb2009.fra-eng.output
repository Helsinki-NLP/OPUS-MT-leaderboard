Right-wing populists triumph in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current Grand Coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's leading political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which with 25.6 percent lost nearly nine percent of the vote, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
The electorate visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the leader of the party and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer, were uttered.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party leadership.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election that remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the grand coalition SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free parties (FP<0xC3><0x96>) would have obtained 18 percent and BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the votes - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still unified.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently bet on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they slightly lost and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four per cent limit and entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India at risk of cooling
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused in India of illegal cockroach harvesting is not resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, which was held following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the talks that it was difficult for the executive branch to intervene in judicial matters.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was discharged from the accusation and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling government, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then seek bail and await trial at large, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same way during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"Above all, we want to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues for many years.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a great misconception," he said.
The minister avoided the question of whether he had received a promise from India to deal with the matter.
“I’ve already received enough promises,” he says.
A Czech arbitrates the fight for the seabed
It approaches a wall-mounted electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are depicted.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
Yet this area is as large as the continent itself,” says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The ardour at work and enthusiasm characterize the reigning atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little-known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found here, as well as currently unknown living organisms, which may hold the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A background larger than the mainland
The coastal states have now begun to aspire vehemently to the new submarine territories.
According to a UN convention, they are in fact using their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered a continental shelf.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yona," Mikulka explains.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf, must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly explorations and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests, those from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which is the first to have significantly expanded its submarine holdings, has recently experienced global resounding.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission assigned to it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, which represents the size of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The future benefits they will derive from the exploitation of the seabed will be, as they plan, invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the zone of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no longer any state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this zone is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, do not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," says exaggerating Director Mikulka, noting that "its zones are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of the Eastern countries within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Commission, together with investors from a few other States, was granted the status of a so-called "pioneer investor" under the Convention.
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is turbulent, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, gives an example of such a concreteness.
It is reminiscent of a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German Special Forces were on site for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but they never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists from the Federal Army and officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were at the place of release.
As the spokesperson for the ministries communicated on Monday evening, German forces were ultimately not called in, as the hostage-takers released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of a release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it on the spot as a support force.
"Thankfully it hasn't happened so far," said a spokesman for the federal interior ministry.
The assailants had abducted in southern Egypt the group of tourists made up of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were relocated to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been rescued have since arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five holidaymakers and special forces are expected to have taken off aboard an Airbus of the air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress narrowly failed the $700 billion bailout of the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s financial markets bailout.
In spite of all the calls from US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to curb the chaos of the financial markets did not get a majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the partisans had desperately tried to convince opponents of the merits of this $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called for MPs to vote in favor although the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones was down more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan could overturn.
It came back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into effect, the approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans’ thirst for travel remains insatiable, according to this study.
As for bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as confided Monday in Berlin the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, growing numbers of bookings already dominate the fall months.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent more compared to 2007, according to DRV.
The sources of these results are the figures from GfK, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1,200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the U.S. would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
Besides this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after destinations by the Germans.
Specially organized trips are in high demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be here "easier to calculate for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very tight so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuous, beer in pitchers per liter and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a custom-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers jump on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean suit seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was limited until now.
But once in Place Thérèse, everything is half worse.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks blased or affected by shame - this is completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume picks up a few weird eyelashes at the banana-choco stand.
A Bavarian woman remarks that I would have tied my apron wrongly: "to the left means free, to the middle virgin, to the cased right, to the rear widow."
Discreetly, I tripped my loop from the back to the left.
“It’s better,” she says and laughs.
Others don't give themselves as much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their naked backstroke without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a "oooooo" lying down.
He told me all this after he was relieved from the cup he had drunk before.
Directly next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild pissers."
Others don’t get the chance to get rid of alcohol this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, rescue workers run to the feast square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in packs - always in fours, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the stuffed under the tarp are not visible.
“These are the ones who can’t swallow anything anymore,” one of the rescuers yells at me in response to my question and then disappears into the fray.
Accident Victim Identified by Police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-Renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation tower at each of its angles, like some German provincial mayoralties.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we no longer have any doubt about the grandeur of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, lagging behind the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and has the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railroad crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points serves, at least symbolically, to underline Turkey's broadening diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now it is time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeper car in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 and a half hours, shaken on noisy rails whose cadence recalled the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning its back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, is an example of a shift in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and particularly Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built of stone and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and many pastries in which the middle managers in suits-bowl-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Suit, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
“The purpose of this foreign policy is to now reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now it has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case with either of them.
She had to do both.
“But at some point, I asked if Turkey shouldn’t choose.”
“Turkey,” he said, “does not want to have to choose between the two.”
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone with whom I was able to speak, recited to me from the heart: The Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought back to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period when Turkey was called "the sick of Europe".
At least, there is no longer any doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 9/11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include the under-21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us over the age of 20 refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to handle any type of music presented to it, whether it was madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is there, in the music.
So sing!"
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver were to be knighted, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was conducting the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me – and, sometimes, they’ve even inspired me.
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, “focus only on certain people.”
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and became in 1950 a member of Hop-Norm research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
This is what comes out of Woodruff’s Beyond Nab End letter, but this is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Hops Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to conceal this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second Assault on Honda's Best Sellers
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the market launch of the first generation.
First of all, we note that Honda renewed this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, almost one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, stands in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it expects to sell 100,000, which would represent a sales growth of 17% in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda sales in Spain.
The managers of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely compensate for the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand’s managers hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, that is to say 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a fall in sales of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to gain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door, compact-sized hybrid - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to sell nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of the Insight will be in the United States, while the other half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change, which is 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and so is the interior space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the trunk capacity – which has a double bottom system – can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity compared to the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to the exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is improved access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions, making the engine more powerful and increasing engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine delivers 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This thruster - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan drew this time on nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center built the small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Safety Shield.
This robot will allow the vehicles of the brand to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee’s compound eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed a so-called Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“As soon as it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic a bee’s movements and immediately change direction by bifurcating its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Displacement Laboratory and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
Every second this device must only process information and act on that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first bus development of new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in production cars within ten years after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with credit banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say 'the Hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Manager leads us to think several times if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
Surely this game gives useful but not detailed information.
It’s more of a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It is better than nothing, since it is unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has also announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s leading bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to take 21 percent of its capital, a news welcomed by a sharp fall in its stock price.
A week after unveiling an interim deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a unit price of $25.25, or a total amount of $3 billion.
The retained price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28 percent above its current price.
Morgan Stanley, however, lost 6.79% at $23.07 at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, CEO of Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but passes it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented Monday further show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, told Tokyo, “we thought that the stake would be composed entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement stipulates that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares within one year if the shares are traded more than 50% above the conversion price, or at approximately $47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a spokeswoman for the group declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" eased its balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which has seen its stock price fall by half as the cost of default risk insurance on its debt soars.
This cost fell on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
To refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it is the third that put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
For the draft constitution to be adopted, he had to win half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and a counting of a non-governmental organization announced a large victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night.
The “Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly,” he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil governorate headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place calmly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the state's power over the economy, reserving it for the "development planning" of a country living essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants the head of state strengthened powers, which can carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and run for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando has launched the assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought safely back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at around 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, which is adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health" and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, brought aboard two helicopters, launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," said the official, who requested anonymity.
He said that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit had been sent in total to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our Secret Service and Special Forces personnel," he said.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle in which the kidnappers were, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army said they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudanese Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate about the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying this election campaign.
I'm glad you did.
But an area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the sums of misery granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only castle in Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with digging through history, preserving with three under piles of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
It is they, often, who are the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, with a sum of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the growing international financial crisis in more than a year is for Fortis Bank. In some respects, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will repurchase almost half (to the extent of 49%) of the capital of the bank located in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell a part of its stakes, among which, in the first place, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch body ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis stocks began a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to let go of bankruptcy.
On Friday alone, the company’s shares fell 12 percent to their lowest level of 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the present value of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company’s managers, is not realistic.
The company's management accuses the uncertainty in the U.S., in connection with the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. bailout, of being behind the crash of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed to head the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they are not going to lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank’s customer circle and no branch was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information regarding the prescription of medicines, in all cases, with the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program has to be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting your chicken coop to a fox,” Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told The Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the insured capital in the event of damage depend on the state of health of the client that arises, and if they feel that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after learning about the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily provides from pharmacies, data on the purchases of medicines of the person in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, which disease the person suffers and what his state of health is.
For example, if that person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol lowering, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts him or her in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is not much more to do for the insurer besides paperwork. However, tiny problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data. They must ask the patient for permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
Henceforth, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctioned for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time controlling usage is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the data subject.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurances do not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus and ultimately, the hens depend on the fox’s benevolence.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this issue also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other, largely global, issues.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a major emerging democratic power that should be given a broader voice in international affairs, but member countries have yet to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not delay too much on this issue, yesterday, at this 9th summit organized in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious objective.
In this regard, they have legally harmonised the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil flights, so that air trade can also flourish in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, the EU's largest trading partner, and New Delhi, which ranks ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on this issue was raised.
The completion of the Doha trade round was also called for, although both played a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains true to the energy and climate agenda, notably that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 per cent until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the fact that it would have to pass a global market at next year's climate conference, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is visiting the French capital today, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to information from the news agency, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers attended the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of Properties and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a meeting with the press in the Room Struktur, at the 5.0 butterfly of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is gradually decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, in relation to that for adults and children.
Steve Fossett's plane was found missing a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is indeed the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared.”
The sheriff said no human remains were found on or near the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Security (NTSB) said that a few hours after the wreckage was located, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset’s personal belongings were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, in 2002, he became the first man to complete the round the world on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had travelled around the world by plane and non-stop.
Among all these records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you don't expect.
An unusual 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, large surfaces and sharp angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the latest born of the off-road "compact" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Precisely because of its out-of-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17.
Thus the hype that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication foresees the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that when looking at the image, the car leaves the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes tries to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future acquirers? We will see.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and that, until now, had never created big problems.
Neither had he ever clashed with the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (few in reality) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolour flags on which their hometown appeared: Saturday night, they were all abducted so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by English cheerleading.
In Bulgaria, they found a fanbase of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police, and then will take action: in this case, it could be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders purge a Daspo for at least five years .
An international Daspo that prohibits attending Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
I'm glad you did.
But now is the time of fear-emulation: that is to say, others risk adding themselves to the hundred and fifty first.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves this way," the Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes wide open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In Apulia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which deal precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duke-Duke choirs, and the arm extended during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste, where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not polite...”
