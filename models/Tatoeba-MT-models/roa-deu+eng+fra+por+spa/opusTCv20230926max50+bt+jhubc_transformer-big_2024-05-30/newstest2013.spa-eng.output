A Republican strategy to hinder Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less prevalent in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of U.S. governments enacted, from 2009, new laws that made it difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, during 2011, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote were introduced in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day, and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
Therefore, the Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a state government agency.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity card with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs that usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed in 2011 certain laws abolishing voter registration on the same day of polling in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wished to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 resulted in a drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored shortening the pre-voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics it was exactly the same.
These represent only 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who make up 76% of the electorate, make up only 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fiercely opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office stepped in to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have passed such laws account for 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Doing the Test or Not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant by themselves, doubt whether or not screening tests should be done.
To take the test or not?
We asked for advice from two specialists.
Studies conducted in the United States found a high rate of contagion among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who did not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of suffering metastases if the screening test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend testing from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer. All possible options should be offered and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not threaten long-term life, in which case you should rather opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are left untreated, as cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We are increasingly determining precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be done.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits is still the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of cancer of the breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, pancreas, and uterus.
"Research shows that regular, lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer," they add.
The Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they escalate the risks of colorectal cancer.
Dairy products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in prostate cancer risks, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of discussing one’s concerns and family history with one’s doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a big shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What’s more, it’s about the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or “least bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely sure.
Anyway, we assume it's about Higgs, since the chances of making a mistake seem small. We'll see what it is about.
There is, in this great world, a general and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There’s no way to break that rule and don’t try too hard, because you’ll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also in it a law of these characteristics: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" consisting, roughly speaking, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories, which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, one might underline here, are not the exotic bugs we might believe.
In fact, if he manages to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone at a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, you need to reach extremely high energies, a little like an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide over the surface.
That’s why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN’s (the big hadron collider is a ring 27 km in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The electromagnetic field analogy is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself glued to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what "can" all these investigations "bring?" asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
For their part, many fervently wish to find each other, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that plugs certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, such as that it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we haven’t found such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such investigations in our day-to-day lives are difficult to predict, but we do not think we are mistaken in saying that it will have none.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They glimpsed the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, said, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus."
Just imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light collector in 1969 in the course of his research on optics.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this pickup now serves as an "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which earned it the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That doesn’t mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
In its Commission Dying with Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see it up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year break.
“I had been given five years to live, but I have been like this for seven years,” he says, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to being helped to eat.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers who devote attention to him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
“My biggest wish is that my diarrhea is cured, it’s humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
“Over the course of our lives we learn that a man pees on his feet,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois centre.
Going back to childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer “cure” care.
Ms. A.’s biggest fear, 89, is dying “consciously and drowning.”
But the disease has made him discover his children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
“I have no desires left in this life,” she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, he expects a final visit from his son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care that is given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit.
Diabetics are no longer in control of their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son ran out of beer at the deceased's feet.
“We help patients and their loved ones alike,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being the same.
Alongside a 94-year-old man enjoying his last family reunion in the yard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after having tried everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who have cancer,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
Seventy-seven per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois center and the home palliative care society of Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," he relates, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering great pains without having done what was necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients want to die just because they don’t get proper care.”
And in parallel, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Helene Richard’s hopes of survival were already low when she left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that she wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not attending to their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can’t pretend that we don’t understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the disease not relieved will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean “I want euthanasia”, but “I want to be relieved”.
This report was made possible by a journalism scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Widespread Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the construction industry, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi are part.
An "industry" that came out too expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system is pulverized once we've hunted down the big media," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of Montreal police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible thanks to a thorough investigation into embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the liberal prime minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission “has already brought down two mayors,” he adds, while hoping to be able to “demonstrate the ploys behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government interventionists, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of the "Marteau squad", which, since 2009, have made the "sewer cartel" of Montreal moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to the serial registration of accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city in the outskirts.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For three years he paid 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia that transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money to right-handers and left-handers during the 2000s, giving more than C$88,000 (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the ruling liberals.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprisant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of $ 736,000, all in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money for inflating the bills between 30 and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal plot of land acquired for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the middle of a real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
Of the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she assures that she pulls "a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
He added that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are cleaning the wounds but we would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert so that the dubious practices do not repeat themselves.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned above all about the role of the "elected politicians aware of the ploy".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was allocated to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "we can not fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain this advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I walk day by day by your side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But they don't care for me.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always made strides.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It is backed by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course I am.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first half of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away our leadership position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish the first of our league against Porto to be able to receive the round of 16.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is committed to its means for this project to be realized.
Failure to win the Cup in League 1, as last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
In the last season we didn’t get very far.
In May we got a disappointment, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
I think this year will be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, that they still run into things to blame us is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We will never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to launch a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have failed to qualify for the round of 16, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage per day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been “driven” by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We better say we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and he scores a lot of goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of League 1.
And he’s shown in every team he’s been through that he’s a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I can play good games in the national team.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we are exemplary today.
What are your thoughts on Didier Deschamps’ first month at the helm of the Blues?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspiring to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the team to Brazil.
Did the 1-1 draw on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn’t experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
It is the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, having reached the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning today to around $10 (quotes are census on the site bitcoincharts.com).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and which can be earned by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both bookkeepers, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the form of an email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are included in the public ledger, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a file-cutting phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "splitting" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit fraud, a user wants to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would be orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is split in two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins on deposit have been stolen.
“The flaw used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Major players like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant sales" were launched.
“They exchanged $30,000,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Cinabul, which turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of an educational book on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Their system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
Moreover, in its report the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, should this currency succeed.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban into Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since his irresistible breakthrough between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country enveloped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants overtaken by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking government land to resell as land for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting alongside huge US outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
The people, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have taken advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are filled with both girls and boys.
We will have to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is eager for mobile phones. TV and its Turkish leaflets presenting a modern world have great admirers all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of the Western nations, but the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the post of prime minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been fixed or major irrigation systems repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper ores from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddha site and remain there as the province’s most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, will also need to re-establish normal relations.
French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a department of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to “win hearts and spirits” and to carry out the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of “civil and military actions” of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and had brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
Those jobs, greedy of obtaining local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation areas.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever as to the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
It caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And for almost two years Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial scramble.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delusion" and continues to "betray his word" and "treat the right."
On the part of his supporters, he said it was a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy is wreaking havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he claimed in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either they vote on my text or I retain full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in their vast majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 substitute members were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted unanimously.
Commentators are amused, on the other hand, by the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all considerations, remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "norms", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than an advertising gimmick.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because “people called upon to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further compounded by the fact that the next rector of the university would be far less moderate than the current rector.
“For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil status.
The majority of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.
"We are referring specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent civil judges are competent to rule above all this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another point of conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Neither will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by human rights associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, Human Rights Watch’s Heba Morayef underlines.
According to her, the only positive thing had been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to appear on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this “baptismal stack” will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus’ miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the filling of nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Here believers travel the Via Crucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Vía Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Anthony, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the Crucifixion, to the Stone of the Anointing and the place of the burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree that was made the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place for the Jews, the Western Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will then become a reality.
Making a Vertical Journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret shelter from enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, can only those who engage in climbing.
The others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Up there, from the foot of the hill bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on top of the mountain.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
In one trip you won’t be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting ones.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases of Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bath Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive private Ralli museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, features one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children ring and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to take courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing muds and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for night concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to be carried in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (currently $1-3,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there are fast trams and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transfer for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to Saturday night, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
On Sunday morning, a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, unflaked fish and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, great variety of sauces, the phalafel, which are ground chickpea balls, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities you don’t see stray dogs.
Instead, there are a lot of well-fed cats that "walk to their liking" imposingly.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Snorers love busy places and do not reject treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it goes out for $ 15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
The majority of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,800 Ukrainian tourists, a figure that exceeds by 51% the same rate of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While deputies and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the law on compulsory examination, scammers have already appeared in the country who trade in "false" certificates
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed home.
As of December 1, a law comes into force, according to which every work immigrant must take an exam to check their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service provision sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, in time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to pass the examination of the language, but also that of Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The exception is citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who obtained their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, Fatality and Defense of Rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, Peoples ' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take part in the tests in all cities, and more than 160 such centers are currently open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, managed to ask the press this question many times: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, replies the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer "working slavery".
Many people talk today about defending the rights of labour immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must be initiated before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants with no profession, no education, those who do not know the language and do not pass medical check-ups.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, sneak a "paid trip" to a creepy, narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," said Tolib Sharipov, head of the Tajik Immigration Service's Labour Immigration Directorate.
Don't get mad, little boss!
However, in the meantime many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention dress them, shoes and buy what they need for school.
As they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It’s hard, if you don’t know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as the language law is concerned, rights advocates point to an important point.
The exams will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no exam and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
Employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and extortion cases appear.
"We are asked 100 or 200 rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stubborn, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was revealed that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several “false” certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The counterfeit documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who could not pass the exam the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons for civil use.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: Tightening shots during wedding celebrations in which luckily there were no casualties, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, in which Tighten seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law on the possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the “hard-handed policy”.
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigor" be given up.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told the BBC news service of Russia.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to the total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civil weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the criminal to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The arms black market is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts weapons orders
The first, "army or military vestige", that is, weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon",those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the fault,” said one former soldier.
According to Baranets, the gun makers also put their grain of sand.
“Private weapons factories have now proliferated that are not competitive in the international market and distribute rope weapons to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert says.
Another black market source is smuggling.
A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market have arrived there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The gun shopkeeper, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a batch.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This one takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros a unit with two chargers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be met, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers," he added.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the platform "Begovaya", where there would be a man who would take me to a "squinita" where we could negotiate.
Of the price of the gun, I only found out there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the shopkeeper. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
There are vendors in the markets, but you also have to get there, let’s say “from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter’s tooth had fallen out.”
I can even get a pair of steel knobs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows that I will not betray him.
Novices look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets put himself to the test as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
He was given a photo album where there was "not everything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” recalls the soldier.
The buyer, in the words of Baranets, is not offered cat for hare: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofas Shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertisement "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
There users place their orders and ask questions.
Do they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"I buy pistol TT. Moscow", laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handedly captures those who wish to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to mine coal in Siberia
Military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, press secretary of the NGO "The Right to Arms".
Viktor Baranets claims that if you place an order online, you are left without a gun and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handedly captures those who wish to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to mine coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "The right to arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
It will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets are on strike.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teens find their first cashier jobs at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low wages paid in Walmart corporation supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and tame itself in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to rising modest wages for Walmart workers and the fast-food system, the protest organizers’ goal is to create workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday" that day, in the United States, co-began the orgy of rebates that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products target people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid workers at Walmart buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
That "Black Friday" rally participants demanded wage increases and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the pay rise on the shoulders of consumers, every visit to the store will be just 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Supporters of Walmart commented that the protest took place in only nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
Black Friday lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company’s representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that they left their jobs “less than five” Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than “another PR stunt” organized by the workers’ union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and so for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then they don't even give you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York receive $8.90 an hour.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, to me it is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teens went to McDonald’s and worked there, behind counters, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there long.
Now, I constantly stumble upon some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers’ unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from impeding this right and punishing union activists with wiles and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive turnover of staff.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place midway through the rally at McDonald's located near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said “we must support fast-food workers to get the fair wages and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As described by the New York Times, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not even all of them were employees of the fast food service, which employs tens of thousands of New Yorkers.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy"
The topic of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is lately normally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was revealed that for the scientists of the company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are drawn to the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been caught in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
The world of computing must be freed from ours, the physicist, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, fuck those silly virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course it can not be considered a panacea, it is pending to solve the issue of privacy, since we do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- In other words, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on the Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that modern series-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
To me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
Is there no need to increase the number of cameras?
The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible fingerboard sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn’t presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is their strength (private things only you can see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the film "Iron Man", but also to any simple mortal.
There’s a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there’s no tactile response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibility to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone was blowing at the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wristbands that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to cheat the brain?
Make him think he feels what he seems like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is hidden another challenge that we will have to fight with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, who find many things in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of the art and scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands a little organ and became the organ grower of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why do you go around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I am dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray provokes aggression and agitation of properties not good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the later ones being exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I went into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
For me it was important to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical arts club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs on phonograms, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; the basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regular customers.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination I was chosen, thus ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very uncult.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which the topicality and the occurrence are clearly expressed.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything is embittered and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothing.
Now one is followed by the clothes, oriented on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, perhaps that person is not even owed his hand, but spitting in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
We recently saw you in the role of an urban organ grower.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before, people were grouped in packs, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simpleons wanted others.
Now all have been divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has their 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come by the thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event 300 people go, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture of consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint paintings.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg missing?
- Good culture experts.
There is one concept: a culture official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right ones everything was different, the kings perhaps did not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed who correctly evaluate these and open their way to them.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is insignificant.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set off in search of a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says State Astronomical Institute chief researcher Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit differed in no way from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophiles.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under weightless conditions.
As a result, we get a normal chick.
But then the trouble starts.
“The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Not finding support, the chicks would flip randomly.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they were just dying.
"And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological “miniark” flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
“This was precisely on the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk passed Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only one year after the flight to space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has worked out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is its natal element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, because it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget anything,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women it is necessary gravitation, the force of gravity.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepitate very quickly, the ability of the fetus to expel is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, this will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
It is impossible for a newborn in orbit to wear a special training suit, as adults do.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally inadequate person," predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will become a reality, as humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their spaceborn children.
Head of NK<0xC3><0x9A>: Inspection of the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system has not found the guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is lame.
Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Office of Supreme Control (NK<0xC3><0x9A>), said in an interview with Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," thus describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDG (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, then neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls or require obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and German team, in the framework of which the legislation concerning public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started about two years ago.
In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organized, followed by the legislation in force in each country and, then, the practice itself.
We have put everything together and, although the control is not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, the concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever stricter rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually do? What do you think the conclusions are?
Precisely such a common control could help us to stop investing efforts in the implementation of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of awards means that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much paperwork, that those who want to look for faults in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NK<0xC3><0x9A> or is it organized in another way?
As for the offices, such as the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which here we call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without specific data, but Germany is still a model in some respects, but it is not possible to specify exactly what is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors?
Surely not, but, I repeat, I don’t like to make such comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, they wouldn't benefit from collaborating with our office, would they?
As regards the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean to your Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
As we carry out ex-post checks, we need to have a certain amount of delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing the future controls: we have started a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public tenders, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and the like.
Do you consider the passage of this law to be beneficial or rather a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every non-compliance with the law on public procurement meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal ruling, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this path leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA1>varc system, with reference to the fact that it is autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then even the prime minister of the government cannot prevent the action of the Office that has an obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations.
He can say, "We change the law and allow it," but he can't say we're going to do anything.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how to act formally. And that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice sheets, although they are mostly walkable
In several parts of the Czech Republic, roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are passable, caution must be exercised in some.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning, the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will fluctuate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, in the crests of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region's road operations control center.
The R6 expressway and the first-class highway in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to exercise extreme caution, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
In addition, all second- and third-category tracks, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with remnants of ice and trampled snow.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports in its pages the Directorate of Roads and Highways.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frost can occur in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysokého M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, and especially on second and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads from the mountains of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e to Orlické hory.
There is a thick layer of snow on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be today between clear and partly cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually fluctuate between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable today in the morning, but caution must be exercised and the weather must be adjusted.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will fluctuate between three and nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some tracks could also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from the information of the control center of road operations in the region.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, although caution is recommended, especially on the road between km 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-rate roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany there may be stretches with ice sheets.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case, sections with ice sheets are also noticeable.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less-traveled roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>.
Road workers cleared the snow overnight; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most of the roads are unrestricted.
"In the highest areas of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, there are snow remains.
Drivers in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské will be met by medium-waste snow in the direction of Jeseník," a <0xC5><0xA0>umper road management operator confirmed to <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also went to the Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the runways of the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road, roads can be driven without restrictions, on the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberská road drivers should drive with caution on forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem Region and Liberec Region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the roadway, while in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the central Czech massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been reported for the time being.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surroundings of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavorable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the region of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched over the road with the weight of snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many alarmist news stories that we like to hold onto.
The Tap Tap music group likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state charity act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to harness the marketing potential that the Mayan calendar ends at 11:10 a.m. on December 21.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 pm, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original key rings against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the world, canceled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, will it be heard at charity concerts?
Of course yes, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world does not end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the music video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charities and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised in the concerts against the end of the world go to?
Equipment for the barrier-free Studeo school, which we have completed for the sixth year in a row with the civil association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ustav school regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a program that is appealing to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustradosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform in Prague.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any other similar "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ské jaro, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
So far, however, we have managed well. <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which still surprises me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned from, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still not frequent for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established that strives to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what respects should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a severe disability to travel on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will begin to really change everything.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ustav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And in time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not come until these last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also actively work to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that work that is not seen, is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the aid of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that you can do something differently.
The show business is full of things that resemble each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone seeing us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and for whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it’s not just a breakthrough for them, but for society as a whole.
Did it help that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We are an open group, people come in and out, you can’t help it.
Whoever has will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, canceled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance the multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational centre in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav in Prague, which costs 25 million CZK.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free admission to the early sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the commissioning of the agency’s projects.
However, Poland’s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture of A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch awards in France for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known around the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he named one of the craters on the moon's hidden face.
Already in 1925 a dresin was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known.
It is unclear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresin or for braking.
The information about this dresine is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
In 1933, Polish artillery began to focus on missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the investigation reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was halted.
In 1937 appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The November 1954 issue of the journal Problemy refers for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA was significantly involved in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>dów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind from height.
In 1962, however, work was suspended.
The successor of the first rockets of the RM type was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum apogee in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Later the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social labor law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour cost (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, by importing cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "causes a drop" in the price of the competitor with the aim of taking over the majority of the market and, in this way, increase its profit margin.
On a large scale, for most entrepreneurs, it means moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing, and the result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
All this situation promotes the total disinterest of the entrepreneurs in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damages that they have caused in their eagerness to obtain profits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to submit specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and, in this way, attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without regard to social decline.
This is especially evident in changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictate of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees as regards labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing gaps between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already at one million.
In the context of the increasing competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly frequent case occurs: people employed at such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of practically all the southern EU states lead, without a doubt, to the same situation: people, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live with a poor salary at the edge of society, in the hope that one day private investor capital will arrive in the country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media affirm to the full that the state should not bring capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with fingernails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its egoism the political march and, therefore, the whole state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the realm of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
Such bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power emanates not from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation such as that described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and the administrations occupied themselves by force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without any hindrance and the people went to the polls with the vote beaten beforehand"... "there were no people of character who aspired to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be spoken in serious to the App" to the autistic power that the only remedy for such a serious situation was the aut man.
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that today’s society is based on disregarded preferences of individual benefit without regard to common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, with no effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that today’s elite completely ignore the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and recent history.
Suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not in the long run.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution passes through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in the year 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on Israel’s side, argues for the right to self-defense and categorizes Palestinians as terrorists; the other supports Palestinians and alleges racism by the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs, and brands Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the periodic killings and who is the victim; after all, the citizens of today's Israel, including the Autonomous Territories, were born within the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who is taking advantage of the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small area of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity the history of the struggles for power is at the forefront.
In every age we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so evident is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power it entails has not been reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have important stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschilds' central bank status, began printing money during the American Civil War, and was murdered in 1865 at the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their zeal for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second was aimed at eliminating colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third was aimed at reducing the earth’s population to between half a million and a billion people (similar amount of slaves for their welfare and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a definitive solution).
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis-triggering and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao – order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, erroneous, and always lead to a worsening of the situation; otherwise, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not repeat itself.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francis Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of the First World War, they shattered Tsarist Russia with the onset of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a covert manner, a conflicting situation following the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (returning to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration laid the foundation for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts with the local Arab population began.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which the international bankers had tied him at first or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers succeeded in initiating it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a frontline casualty, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine for welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are sharply divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its leaders, because, as happens in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), it would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes 20% of the world’s crude oil-to-wide economy (the world’s only shipping corridor).
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 now shown: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in your imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-to-do financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
And it compels all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of its name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers on his forehead, let him add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo Movie: If It Gets Raw, Call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist student protesters occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for dethroned Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive perspective: throwing the shah overboard could not afford it, since, if it did, it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was out of reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detained diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
Failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter’s defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck themes an episode of this story, which was a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, to help a cover story an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team examining the location in the country for the filming of a sci-fi blockbuster.
Combination of Genders
The plan that "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez mapped out required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
The details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines moods. We find on the one hand well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are shown emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were captured in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical scenes of Hollywood a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And besides, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Bye-bye little, Good-bye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he was raised.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is “wheeling” in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of the bewilderment and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the imposter team at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a story told doesn’t offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: everything doesn’t turn out so elegantly here (the scene of the crisis at Tehran’s airport, the diversion of a call to America and the rampant search for its trail turns into madness).
Argo’s weakness is the out of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses a bit of dramatic plot, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it collapses, it will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of the omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd rules or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU is planning to approve a quota of 40 percent of women in management positions in large European companies," said Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have been at the forefront of better life insurance prices because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive obscures the size of the cages of the hens, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
There has been criticism of the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the removal of the classic light bulb from shops.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under the pressure of one or the other commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should be at least 14 centimeters long in the EU and should not have "abnormal curves".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that with this it only seeks to harmonise the national rules not homogenized to date, which only complicated their marketing.
Rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the grounds that the existing directive entails a waste of groceries.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year’s EU prescription that in inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was referring here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of child death from suffocation.
There is also a similar restriction on the use of blackbirds by children up to the age of 14.
Curious events are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
Thereafter, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume established for preserved mushrooms, which posed a substantial threat of a fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application of grants.
This kind of idea did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have the sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation," then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) said in the fall of 2004.
He argued with the fact that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU) and is intended specifically for the drafting of grant applications from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the target of criticism, the EU’s regulatory efforts and also a more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which the member states have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs, like other countries of the Union, are also affected by the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even if our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the denomination of origin of Olomouc cheese, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became called "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known worldwide, the marzipan of the German city of Lübeck or the ham of Parma, for example, there are already the biscuits of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and of T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>a and, even, the variety of lú<0xC5><0x9F>.
As EU protected maras, you can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice v Podkrokono<0xC5><0xA1>í boats.
People want me to save the republic, but I’m an amateur, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did you think of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If all went well in our country, then I would not present my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes are raised and the retirement age is raised.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am now forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter he has set out for the presidency.
Isn't he turning his back on those people who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results of the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I was elected senator, I would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That’s why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest mandate as possible.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate change.
To this are added the media, which discredit you and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I am said to have bribed journalists or to have been an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your ideas.
He presents himself to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property above twenty million.
To do this, the law must change.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobbying group for the profession of guide to be recognized as self-employed, and we got it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to win the support of all parliamentary groups.
With no party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn’t matter to me, whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the SDG, and I will likewise be against bad ideas.
He jokes when you're told you're a populist.
But aren't you proving it with what you're saying?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals of which I speak already work in the world or well-known experts speak of them.
But without the support of parliament, he has only slogans left.
And with this he cannot survive in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want to.
If there is a strong character who points out the disputes, it can put pressure on the political scene.
Take for instance the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to look for allies.
I’ve just started out in politics and I’m trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to get things done myself, but in case it doesn’t go well, in six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, that’s why I’ve visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because he had a lot of work to do.
For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two from the independent sector.
The people chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check the flawless past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't even have money for the campaign for the presidency, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
He's talking about property declarations, what's yours like?
I estimate my private property at about $60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of works of art valued at ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at $60 million and have no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to get into debt?
In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there isn’t too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign with money from my own pocket.
The expenses of the campaign essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn’t live off it, for example, I couldn’t afford my son English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I only wanted to make money, then I wouldn’t run for office.
So you're going to keep up with your business so you can live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As promised, I have partly quit my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
The people would want the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep winning.
If I was president, I would quit business.

The architecture studio MVRDV shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by who walks by the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: “Moreover, the building is beautiful.”
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
No one gets into those old-fashioned libraries out of taste, right?
Spijkenisse, a dorm city on the outskirts of Rotterdam that barely deserves a short visit, holds the dubious honor of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that appear represented on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how policymakers decided that there was only one way to improve statistics: you had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings as well as cynical, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked around in perplexity and shrugged its shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called <0x60>Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain rises in its intended location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and townhouse buildings.
At the beginning of November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy power plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheesecake.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to embrace with the view, the annealed brick floor and elegant streetlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up you can see the park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally the book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to turn upside down the classic spatial configuration and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserve the black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most day-to-day architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we come across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands a plastic fabric of few millimeters thickness has been used as a base to hold the roots of the crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
“Although it is hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Even though the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden trusses located in a transverse direction to the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Similarly, the professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has deepened.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to decorate.
In this way, the study MVRDV has achieved a success in that queen discipline that in specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and unlearned he may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather pesky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany hinted that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status at the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why? Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to prove its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the Libyan uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is currently reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to doing so.
I think they’re still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they’ve already started the road to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of countries such as France or Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and by its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken on the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, she must be careful and not alienate herself from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn’t give it that much importance since it’s not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by refraining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with this Germany has managed to earn a certain respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has been clearly in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great deal of understanding towards the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is evident that the government cannot publicly defend this position.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not actually have the scale attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is pursuing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the stance of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a higher entity, but they must propel things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to take a European stance.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it has with Israel.
This has always been a tricky topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or maybe you still find it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to struggle to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany takes the lead, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
Viewed in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The US influence in European politics is decreasing more and more, but the EU is not filling that gap at the moment, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a well-known brand worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a claim.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the reason.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer with the Taylor Wessing law firm who specializes in violations of Far Eastern protection rights.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which she keeps seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied for the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are department stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are of a different kind: on behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word originates from the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan".
This refers to women who have “sinned” for a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
“It’s damaging to the business, you have to fight it,” Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are millionaire, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third-largest luxury goods market and the fastest growing.
However, obtaining the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the name that was the subject of the lawsuit had already become a “market reality.”
“If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged the plagiarist’s trademark in China,” Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why today the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely initially wore a white and blue logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
Clothing maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the labor emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed complaint processes has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is usually the case in China, the numbers are astonishing.
Last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new entries worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed as duties.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as evidenced by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg trademark.
“We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the Munich appeal.
In the following two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opposing side is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending a resolution.
Wentzler is confident that he will be able to resolve the issue favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the corporate archive has had to review records up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching an amicable agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” says Wentzler.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
In particular, if the imitators secure there the rights to unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since left this commercial area, but has managed to prevent registration.
“We have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is to "register also in China everything that may be susceptible to protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last round of his private battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party licensing fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would expel us from the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
Heidelberg rehearses the Imbongi choir and Swaziland rejoices AIDS orphans
The story of a bond capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First we start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heeled shoes and loafers look for the compass on the parquet floor, and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then the singers' voices (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, swirling, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost leave his boxes when he tries to put order with his energetic and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the homeowner.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found sponsors in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "panegyrist" in Zulu.
In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this Bantu language, but singing they do know.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8,733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what is affecting Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not like circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of contagion by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s inhabitants are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their thirties has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the chances in a poor country are more than meager.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs of viral origin are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Scabies and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of every five cases of syphilis in Germany are caused by sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV contagion among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were recorded in 2011.
This is one-tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but they don’t offer 100% protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend undergoing regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change your sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any delayed consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir collects for its performances throughout Germany, they raise a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says proudly Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini a self-confident woman with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care of the orphans to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof over their heads, and ensure that children attend school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are left under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is evident throughout the country, it is not usually spoken of openly.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s about sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excess-filled lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the innumerable seasonalists who travel the country from one side to the other and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "At any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to tear a couple of tears out of some angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small town barely appears on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is well known.
“Come close to Esitjeni, there the light shines,” the locals say.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of the Bergheimer street full of singers marking the way, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also ice water there, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger spacecraft has reportedly found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the permanently shadowed area of the planet.
It appears to be at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water comes presumably from comets or, with high probability, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the ice find to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger's chief researcher, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
Occasionally they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet."
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the hardest to recognize is the pink color of "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, dubbed unromantic by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This sunshine image of an extinct star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is made up of the material the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as the Seven Sisters, are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This budding star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It's probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Swirl Galaxy.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lines divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies swoop into each other and end up colliding irretrievably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it as the Southern Mill.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and x-rays taken by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, dubbed Arp 273, served for a moment as a model for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars also continually emerge; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen could be found mostly in the universe.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have more and more depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is lifted.
It allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
At Mauna Kea, a new telescope of enormous proportions and a mirror diameter of thirty meters is planned to be built.
This is a picture of what it would be like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the beginning of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that there is also ice at Mercury’s south pole.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have been pointing to the existence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now sure that it is.
Drink butter every day and live to be 168 years old

In the south of Azerbaijan many people are able to reach biblical ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus rushes through the winding road that passes beside wooded hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of which not much is known, besides that they perfectly master Persian and Azerbaijani and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The astonishing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the World’s Oldest People,” says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozen Talyshis of the place who have surpassed 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived for 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is Shepherd Shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies this.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov’s age is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter at the age of 136.
Was <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov wrong then at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
“In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan there are also very elderly people,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil registry either.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the Talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in a small town called Cengemiran.
At 97 years old he is relatively young for what is styled for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
Two small children also play from side to side.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea served in a typical glasses with a domed shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the scarf hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son discovers us proudly.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen off and has kept its color.
“I have never used a shampoo,” Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I have never been to a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything returned to its proper place when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult of the father figure of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he handed the witness over to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s gray-haired son is right: “In our culture the elders are highly respected.”
They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this weren't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
“We need to get through the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
All of them, so far irremediably plunged into a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost apologizing, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world knows very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour evening meeting, are truly troubling.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does “principles” mean?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal room for maneuver that it has, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak’s dictatorship, these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
This formulation is so imprecise in legal terms that with the help of this article the state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, this is nothing but censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legates.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording that prohibits "offense to people"
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks in the face of Islamist superiority.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to break the Act before it can go into effect.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third on the presidential election lists.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be "in the trash can of history."
On Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned," opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration; just in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it to the cry of: "the people demand the application of the divine law".
They demanded that Morsi “cleanse the country,” while proclaiming: “The Koran is our constitution.”
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi’s supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those opposed to the draft constitution and supporters of it would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now it would have been time to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed the majority.
"The term 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face trial during Mubarak’s dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
“And now the expression ‘Human Rights’ doesn’t even appear in the new constitution,” he laments in a conversation with the newspaper “Welt am Sonntag.”
The extension of Morsi’s powers to the three powers of the state led to his resignation.
The measures adopted are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control."
Norwegian rakfisk: the stinkest fish in the world?
Norway’s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country has anything to do with its greed for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a series of over-cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, damp football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the crippling scent of rakfisk, one of Norway’s delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly you prefer it.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
“You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the “General of the Rakfisk,” who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking from a sip significant amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not unlike a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty swept Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, the fish was kept during the autumn immersed in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A current of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even not too much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential, though rather foul-smelling, part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you a whopping <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it to be so.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22 event.”
The Norwegians find it very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway’s current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she passes rakfisk trays and who, with her long blonde hair and astonishing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, wise men.”
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like bragging, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; everything but a small percentage of the money coming from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone wasted money they didn’t have during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a laugh.
I'm in the snow waiting in line to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite juicy to savor.
But at night, that foul-smelling fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held in which diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A television has connected live with a bow tie presenter who is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls off the chair, perhaps beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad nowadays.
In a city that, under the best of circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing huge chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplaces, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the nation’s management.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My administration has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Prior to hanging out with the U.S. president, Mr. Peña’s previous political experience was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A highly populated and rapidly growing state, it surrounds the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory he used to move into.
A sincere man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit it with the growth of local tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive by one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with his name at the entrance of a modern sports hall and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he will achieve real and lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a deputy from Mr. Peña Nieto's PRI party.
“Particularly when it comes to security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change our country so badly needs.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was overthrown by Vicente Fox in 2000.
MP Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition’s qualification of lack of essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic statesman and, above all, a person who knows how to listen."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under highway stretches is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called upon to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
Most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
“When I got home, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned,” recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross that reads a single word: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says he’s been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a rioter, a whiner.
What they want is for you to just accept what they say and shut up.”
“But that can’t be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his tenure.
“I hope he’s the same kind of president he was when he was governor,” says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning during his time in prison
The trial centers on Manning’s tenure at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning’s imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors sought to show Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now alleges he suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution’s interrogation of Manning at a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Chief Prosecutor Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits by unit officers that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he was receiving.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence ' s request that the case be dismissed given that his imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already entailed sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
In Friday’s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at the Quantico military prison, where he was held in maximum confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and written down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had described the treatment given to him by the caretakers as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facility in general as "very professional."
The forms show no allegations of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about certain issues and that the officers visiting him had spoken about those issues and had indicated that they would be addressed, but that they had not recorded those issues in the record.
“They wrote ‘no incidents’ (after talking about problems) but that doesn’t necessarily mean I wouldn’t have mentioned any problems,” Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not reported the treatment she was receiving during the January 2011 meeting with a board tasked with examining suicide intentions that she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said it had put him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was okay and (wanted) to stop being under injury prevention ... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered committing suicide in Kuwait and had once lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in that cage.”
Manning claimed that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most of his days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, unaccompanied.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from outside pointing at his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the janitors could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him to turn around again.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation she had made in Thursday’s statement that, after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of caretakers and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with a blanket during the count.
During the judge’s interrogation on Friday, Manning said she inferred from the order given to her by the janitor that she should drop the blanket she might have covered herself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered her to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic in his underwear or flip-flops to self-injure himself but had not.
Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
Her lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she went through during her time in prison and drastically reduce her sentence in case he is convicted in court, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanor offences and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has said Manning was detained under the rules of any detainee in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely come down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Signs indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" and one for "Extranjeros".
I stayed there for a few seconds not sure where I was going.
Growing up in Central California, I've been called a "Mexican" all my life.
It’s ethnic shorthand, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as “Irish” or my friends in New York call themselves “Italian.”
Later I decided to call myself "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the level of vocabulary of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when Mexico’s president-elect, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, included: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at this time it is as likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as that he will venture to go to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create in North America a trade bloc in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them of it are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma stand on the foot of war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was one person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was shut the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are his descendants and we are loyal to him.
Not in Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the ruling class elite do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us over the shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter are bothered by this.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and press political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And with wage inequality, rampant corruption, and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, friends.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unprepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
Israel-Hamas ceasefire could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and usual discussions about who started first, heaps of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed, and for the first time missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything torn apart whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make their struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that his deadly impasse could be stalled.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on Nov. 21 is maintained, this week’s clashes have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has been badly beaten.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on Gaza’s 1.7 million inhabitants in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its ruthless rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders may conclude that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The cheerful Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hezbollah dominates the militia party, to Syria, where increasingly Islamist rebels could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood are Hamas’s cousins and their leaders rely more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase even though, under international law, they are illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the Jan. 22 elections, is in a good position.
Why spoil those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets the way their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter his calculations.
Even if Islamists who seize power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the area’s superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, in the same way a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions to Gaza every two to three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one preached by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the impending attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic Tobacco Packaging Act Takes Effect in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases appear on green-smoked cartons, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia’s pioneering generic tobacco and packaging law comes into force, replacing brand logos and colors with an olive-green off wrapper, frightening images of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies who are sick because they are the children of parents who smoke.
With the exception of the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed in a small typeface.
This is the world’s strictest regime for tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia claims that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit glamorous.
Trust studies that show that if a person hasn’t started smoking before the age of 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never do it.
"You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls linked the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for silicone skins and covers to cover the unpleasant images on the cartons had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in Australia's Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and was waiting for more stocks.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social media among the demographic sector targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has shifted to online.
Australia has banned internet advertising to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign sites.
“If you market tobacco and only have this little window left to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from “common citizens” posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It is worth asking if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is more focused on what the new rules mean than on marketing.
The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming before the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in boxes.
They are currently compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
“The photographs don’t affect me.
I just don’t listen to them.”
"You take the cigar and put the package away," says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packs make it harder for him to put them on the shelves.
“It usually took an hour to unpack a delivery; now it takes four,” Yu says.
“The government should have banned tobacco altogether and then, it’s okay, it’s over and we close the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get bored a little bit
During this year’s Thanksgiving holidays, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying in suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention duty-free stores.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it is okay for us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Boredom forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we don’t experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in a good mood?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And no, no.
But, we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book Boredom: A Lively History, published in 2011 by Yale University Press, puts it, it is not so.
“In fact, the story of boredom is very long,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti on boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it’s already been defined and discussed in very different ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and raising the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desiring, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you up.”
He states that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the disruption of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be their own.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a journal article.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to an unrelated full-volume television program, others listened to it at the low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they struggled to concentrate, but were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, disturbed attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like spotting defective parts in a manufacturing line, distracting music can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or scribbling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a “boredom-tendence scale.”
The scale includes issues such as “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
It found that 32 percent of teens said they got bored while they were in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they got bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that “teenage is a time when boredom reaches its highest levels,” largely because both children and teens are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question at the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Boring is the brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And “that ability to dose itself applies to other situations,” he says.
Not only does your child learn to entertain themselves, but he learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate to something worthwhile,” she says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a downtime.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community high school student and footballer in southeastern Colorado, faces criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September day, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences each entailing a $100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanors for marijuana possession are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s most conservative district prosecutors have pledged to move forward with cases opened for marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly authorized marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This is all changing so quickly that I don’t know what’s next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in Washington state are also turning the tables.
They continue to seek advice on establishing a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licensing before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us,” he says.
Washington’s law, dubbed I-502, comes into force on Dec. 6, leaving a year during which you will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to offer “adequate access” to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of conducting cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters from schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city’s prosecutor would stop filing lawsuits for minor misdemeanor possession of marijuana against people over the age of 21 and that police would stop filing charges against those crimes “with immediate effect.”
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce the city’s regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to take legal action against those misdemeanours that at the time they occurred were a crime,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer summon adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and the justice system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier to district attorneys,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing marijuana possession defendants and a local spokesperson for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
“They’ve spent so much time bringing people to court that they still can’t actually accept that it’s legal,” he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the nationwide test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales frontier, they also look forward to receiving directions from the federal government, which still envisions considering the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana-selling businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
“While anti-drug agents are likely not to knock the door down to confiscate a small bag of drugs, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores for the sale of recreational marijuana, permitted under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
“Our community voted against this amendment.
We’re looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for.”
Many questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: 'I was harassed until I got kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory'
Students are not attacked for their views only now
I don’t remember any time in my life where I haven’t been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been at what I thought was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary Greek symposium that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue a career in History, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had given up because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had left because I was forced to drink in chapped cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for a single reason, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You may wonder what that comes to now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of middle-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of Conservative Party students is such in Oxford that last week a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's JCR say they are "often seriously sidelined, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college’s Equal Opportunity Committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and which presented the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" by introducing higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice president of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
“People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cherill, a 19-year-old president-elect of the OUCA, says JCR members’ attitude toward people who are center-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was lonelier than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest.
The year before, the university had voted to deny former student Margaret Thatcher an honoris causa degree following cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder with awe.
Already during the first days of the welcome week for new university students, when new students meet and meet professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that the professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative university students, but also participated in it willingly.
The policy of the miners’ strike, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminary.
The first I attended had to be translated into English French texts of the eighteenth century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not a single one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew well how to expel bad bile.
“Do Thatcherists refuse to learn French, or are they just silly?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning with the tears I was trying to contain.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt grunted.
I returned to my room like a soul in grief.
That night I sat alone at dinner time at the university; then I felt a slight slap on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
“I’m afraid that’s how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labour.”
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick proved useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated.”
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
“How do the Tories have sex?” one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could he ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to hang out with people who thought like me only after dark?
Should I become a Labourist and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a Professor of Contemporary History assigned to my college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative Party, but also Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote her speeches.
I was barely there.
He detested the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I started commuting daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said sadly.
“They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.”
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just for fun.
It would break my heart if you let me.”
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional stamina was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had implied, quite seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red with shame on the inside, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed” me and called them “stupid old men.”
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch’s press.
My door was locked.
I was inside curled up in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed up and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me a weak tear.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Conservative party prime ministers but, to this day, hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are plenty of private letters and photos with the signature of the most pomegranate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble tailor in the northern Italian city of Voghera to an idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty is nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t turn off their butts on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his villa in Gstaad," explains the former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, glossing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the couturier.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
There were 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, everything was seen and felt its spirit.
“Each of the guests made us feel important and dear,” recalls the top model, who began working with him during Paris Haute Couture Week in 1995.
“It never goes out of style because their designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Parade of alcurnia
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-required loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous walkway of sixty meters long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the walkway to contemplate a dream "audience" that wears masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Em, used by Mottini or Onassi.
In this audience of mannequins shine names such as Sibylle of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sophia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love of women, because it enhances our beauty,” adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting the age and the opportunity to wear one of his night suits...
The time finally came at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flared skirt, draped "corsage" and word of honor neckline.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps the dressmaker's party dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding costume at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the tailor calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk suit with inlays of pearls, twelve different types of lace and a four-and-a-half meter tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the haute couture of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the clients of high society".
Obsessed for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his client's husbands.
"I've always been struck by its refinement, its calm, its neat and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The toughest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their job is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies upon contact with air.
After pulling out large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend at turtle pace, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the cliff.
They know that any mishap could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell down the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once upstairs, they make their way among tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, tiringly loading the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is about PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As usual it is to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries three daily.
It takes three hours in each and ends up grinding, but they allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such an inhuman effort, it is triple what he would earn in the field.
“The miners’ wage is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as forceful as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought her to Java."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing hard at the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass his bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
It is the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
“I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man might be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden cabin with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when his characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends to the crater lighting himself with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers carry the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and at both weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of surcharge per camera that, along with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the beasts and not for the people,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, she says she will endure working "as much as she can" because she needs the money to educate her three children, aged between 18 and 10.
I won’t retire, I’ll die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and peels the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that none of them complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pains and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can now only carry 50 kilos at his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades pluck 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away along a goat path in the weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” proclaims Unainik, opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest trades in the world: the one done by the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that — or perhaps because of that — the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (cake) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill “their national duty.”
This is purely internet stuff, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We’re the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 Children
The one who does not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and their strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as the replenishment rate – was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, says it’s due to “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness, and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with population decline has created resentment among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, whom they criticize for keeping wages low and failing to integrate.
The surge in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government tries not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have had a lot of sales success.
However, there are concerns that they may promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family-owned homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate firm EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district doesn’t seem to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it,” says one young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
The private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private or "the area of private life that you have the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under the age of 16?
How does this definition apply to your daily life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by venting situations on the Internet that you would surely not share offline?
The Journal interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on a personal level, and “in the username and password,” when they applied it to social media.
“My deepest secrets I wouldn’t upload to a post,” says Jorge, 10, as he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he’s had accounts for two years.
“They’re very secret secrets, my mom may know them, but not everyone,” she says.
On FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I am also entertaining with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a picture that isn’t mine, or someone who’s making a fool of themselves,” she says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs of naked people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just upload them,” he adds.
"Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," she says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone recommending it to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts opened on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has hinted at him or asked for his home address or phone number.
“If they pressured me or demanded that I just take them out of my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
“He never knew who he was,” he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
“It just gave him privacy.”
Then he explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I like it badly or if I feel like it.
“Although I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed," he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what should or should not be disseminated, published or said at an age that maturity does not give for that."
“They should also be selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is through questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t help,” he adds.
Below Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to be posted a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you tag holiday photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, do you all need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it should be on social media," he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read social media policies consciously.
By understanding each of the sections they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or post,” he says.
According to Guardia, it’s key to remind children of the lesson of “don’t talk to strangers.”
UNASUR Summit ends without publishing Lima Declaration
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven presidents attending.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency indicated at the beginning that they would deliver it after the closure, but later said that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian government’s website.
When consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but this is Humala’s pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III South America-Arab Countries (ASPA) Summit, and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that had previously been announced was also not disseminated.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure that transmission systems were insured for all journalists but limited the obtaining of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling of the Hague Court that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to listen to the arguments of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will abide by and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals,” Piñera said, shaking hands with Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $ 17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence".
It reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for his reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbors, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful manner the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him to handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defense ministers previously met to approve the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro-tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, affirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state-run TV Peru that Europeans "did kill themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the project to establish South American citizenship that is encouraged by UNASUR member countries.
"It is necessary to achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose pact on human rights.
Those who give chairs never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep democratic and human rights values."
He added that, at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his process would not be respected.”
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that he be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sex crime when "Swedish law itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there is a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian president said.
What does exist is the danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health by being enclosed in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa said the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a salvoconducto that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London seeking a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word we do not use in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings in different European instances,” he said.
He said, “If Britain gives the safe haul tomorrow, this is over.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem will end.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as an advocate of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, he welcomed the fact that it is no longer these journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and he said that if re-elected he will "deepen the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup endowed with legality" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that failure is not being met.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the willingness to walk together.
We need to process them extensively to overcome them and move forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the litigation for maritime limits maintained in the same court Peru and Chile and opined that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept judgment no matter how hard."
Referring to the eventuality of running as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 election, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador’s, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last term in the presidency and that’s when we got out of public life.
If we lose the same.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths are a cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed positive for AIDS.
"It was like a bomb dropped on me," he recalled the moment of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to make "smoother", with no obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inquire about it; with such endeavor that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, still many people arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, “depleted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after saying that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious disease and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affectation to the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that who receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as he stays in control can live without problems until 75 years," explained the interviewee.
To measure this advance, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths as of May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been assured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medication the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, have to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who require it.”
In its proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) agree, also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested in a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had been tested by a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know.
“If I’m going to die, I’d better blow myself up three times a week,” they say, “No in my case.”
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise, take medications.
To date, her parents only know she had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIUM JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, within the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
That they get tested, if they had risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the battle slogan to AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist who has taken up the cause around HIV.
The biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with sly and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which teenagers do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed redirecting this ineffective distribution; that the condoms are not only behind the counters and those hundred are found in public toilet dispatchers of the sites frequented by young people.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
It is not a question of paying for the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded when he asked him if there would be a distribution of condoms in his Administration.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for one recorded case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by an appeals court of the United States a judgment that does not know the restructuring of the debt of Grupo Vitro achieved through a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario places a nefarious precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of the signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical field, the support to the sentence issued last June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the northern district of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to Mexico’s leading glassmaker to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
At first glance, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says the main proceeding is the commercial proceeding in Mexico.
The first point would imply ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created, with the American Law Institute placed as the arbiter.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompanies vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial tender the debts that had with their parent the subsidiaries of Vitro, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, that is to say the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, will not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
The fact is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced since 2008 in the wake of the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, hitting the country.
For the time being, the signature of the González Sada family will file an appeal for reconsideration before the Court of Appeals itself so that the vote reaches the plenary of this court, that is, the five judges, since only three voted.
If this does not prosper, the appeal of Cerciorare that requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States, will be claimed.
The seriousness of the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competition Law, noting that it was released in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to tie this with chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Law.
Moreover, it is noted that the country followed the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensure equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Balance General
Slept for several months the complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Pilots Aviators already found the bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the businessman to extract from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Searching for Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and general members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products of the country of the wall, with a housing area to fit for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast zone to oppose the monumental thing that ravaged part of protected areas and poses the mother of all hideouts against the industry.
Acta is dead.
Overruled by the government a Senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action came despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes was linked to the sport of the board for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as extensive a mental collection of local basketball history as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was a player of minor categories, player of the National Superior Basketball, attorney and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I have worn many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his wide trajectory, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures with the most excitement are those that reminisce about his time with the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he served 15 years serving as co-powered or in charge of the franchise.
“Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy championships since 1967, whether it was as an attorney, a co-empowered or a leader.
They were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships raced from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy’s debut year at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, “I have a very strong player, 6”7” in height.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our top shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon one championship, Gausse would help bring in another.
The Cowboys' championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already in the distance, because by 1988 it was already a federative leader.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executors and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the Pre-Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and it must have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that group of the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won us the bronze in the world championship.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995 Pre-Olympics in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-playing players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a junior Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the Pan American mess of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculin did.
And that’s without counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Boricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of “Dallas,” died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas production company.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it she played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when she meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly detestable J.R. that brought Hagman to his highest stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase “Who shot J.R.?”, designed to generate expectation around an emotional episode in which Hagman’s character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series an audience record at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment show in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to label her a prostitute unless she left the city, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), interned.
“I know what I want on J.R.’s tombstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
Recording of five of the episodes for season two had already been completed and a sixth was in the works, the network reported.
There was no immediate comment from either Warner or TNT on how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had it in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on New York theater stages in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything there that I thought would hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation he became an organ donor and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I value them, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like “don’t be afraid, it’ll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they’ll be fine.”
She was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
They start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the Mayan Calendar’s “long countdown” on December 21, which many people have clung to as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff some have called “deudarmagedon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only professor offering courses on the “end of the world” this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled just “The End of the World.”
“We didn’t add ‘2012’ to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It got saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing graduate student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I'll enjoy it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a professor — said they believed in the expiration date of Dec. 21.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredit it,” said Julie Zeglen, a senior student at Temple, 21, from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he said there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a spike in this speculation.
“Elsewhere people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any “end-of-the-world” courses there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the Last Judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, “people will begin to think immediately about the next date” or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end-of-the-world" parties.
“Maybe I’ll call some friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
