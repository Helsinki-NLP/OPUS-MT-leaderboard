Members of the Welsh assembly concerned that "they identify them as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposed modification of its title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen from the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have expressed their concern that this measure may become a mockery.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his party was concerned that MWP "runs with Twp or Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that the whole of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
A conservative Welsh member said his group was "open" to the name change, but also commented that there was too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualifier for appointing the members of the assembly will of course fall to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Assembly of Wales full power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee opted for "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
Members of the assembly are apparently suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach consensus can be a headache for Assembly President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their denomination during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
The citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not they want to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite over the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the elderly people I’ve spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
Nowadays, there is no one left of the two.
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
“People have a different way of socializing nowadays,” he says.
“Bars have already ceased to be that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people went periodically.”
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders anticipate "and that sooner or later they will return to the place from which they left".
Churches, he adds, could eventually be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will be of no help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore what they will do will be to speed up the closure of all churches, as it is altogether unlikely that the majority of people who move into these condominiums will end up being members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation nearby acquired ownership of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly described the carillon as "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who rang the carillon in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded at St. Martin's in recent months, however, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing concern that the diocese "wanted to pass on the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy While Searching for Locusts in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for locusts in California on the first day of the locust season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of a boy asking for help. Then they paddled with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was about the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he "recognized that he was screaming 'I've been bitten!
They bit me!"
He had his whole collarbone torn,” Hammel observed as he reached the boy.
“For everyone to come out of the water, I shouted, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in serious condition.
It is not known which shark is responsible for the attack.
At a press conference, lifeguard Larry Giles said he worked for a few weeks that a shark had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s has decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product aisles in the style of department stores busy with specialized employees.
These large aisles are just part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty market, a market that moves around <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as the fashion and home products sectors lag behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if the test proves successful.
The investment in beauty products is the product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space on their shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of similar brands to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the re-launching phase of its Boutique makeup product range so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores. The first one was done last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day at small supermarkets has made large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s chief executive, the stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight off discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets in many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch food sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket chain's previous attempt to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's did a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended up rushed into disagreement on how to divide the profits of the pharmacy chain within supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its business of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
According to Sainsbury’s, Lloyds will play an important role at the global level as it expands the range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, commented: “We have transformed the look of our beauty products corridors in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help when offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to fit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and convenient location make us now one of the favorite destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby backs off <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons' star Den Peter Jones left "angry" after television host Holly Willoughby backed off a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the Truly joint home products and accessories business.
The business of these two media characters had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' star Den Peter Jones angry as she retired at the last minute from the lucrative lifestyle brand joint venture to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring her big profits.
According to several sources, Jones was "angry" when the blonde television star admitted during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new agreements, worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, implied that she would no longer have enough time to devote to the Truly joint brand of household products and accessories.
The business had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to a source: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was meant to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to back down left all parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow Headquarters ready to be sold.”
According to experts, the departure of the host of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions because of the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had had an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president last March.
Both couples spend the holidays together. In addition, Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity at the ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we will not comment on his business".
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about possible criticism from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unseemly for a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mocking the tone of voice of a news anchor:
“I haven’t given up on anything.”
He noted that Kim had an interest in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told United Nations General Assembly leaders on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to its country's first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the US continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end of missile tests, help to free hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded venue, we’d have about 200,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
One island destroyed and hundreds killed in tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding,” says Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not safe even if foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute in offering aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not frequent on other shores.
The apparent lack of warning sirens at Palu in the event of a tsunami, although there was a warning in place, is very likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Moving between the huge number of Indonesian islands is, at best, a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is now heading for Palu; however, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of the damaged infrastructure of Indonesia, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces re-election next year laden with funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of fighting taking place in the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Observe: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores the tie with a far shot against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was losing 1-0.
He settled the ball to the left before letting go of an incredible shot aimed at the second post.
The shot crossed the entire area with great elevation as it propelled toward the right cross of the goal.
The ball finally started the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended at the bottom of the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch and I didn't think much about it, I just started kicking."
Chelsea won 1–0 at halftime after scoring a goal in the 25th minute by their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, Blue's frontman returned Mateo Kovacic one pass from his heel before starting from almost midfield and sprinting to Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
He then made a magnificent deep pass, leaving Hazard in the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overcame the defense to finish on the second post with a shot with his left leg where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group stage of the Champions League next Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, meanwhile, will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency data reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the debris of collapsed buildings due to the 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday that caused waves of up to 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.

I would also like to call on anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything via the car’s on-board camera, to get in touch as they could have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, police say they are reporting the incident to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.

A number of agents remained within the cordoned off area controlling the block of flats.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mentioning file 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the Taliban’s purest-style destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor that he did during the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed by many to be worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously from the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a totally accurate representation remains a subject of historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, local sources said.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and covered in blood near a pig yard at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a courtyard in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjoining pig yard.
He claimed that in the courtyard there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg piglet had fatally wounded the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were shattered and full of blood,” said the cousin, surnamed “Wu,” as mentioned in Guiyang’s evening news.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented in the evening news that the pig was locked up and isolated in order to prevent anyone else from attacking, while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Despite being very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
“They like to play.
They are like children, they are very curious... they do not go with the idea of hurting.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the colder waters off the north coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastwards towards the US west coast. When the Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical moisture northwards towards the US southwest.
El Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Next, the tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates near 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 50 to 100 mm is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility of flooding, as the situation is deteriorating very rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is not advisable to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can carry wind gusts and dust clouds at specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rainfall at certain points along the southern coast of California.
It is possible that rainfall totals above 50 mm may be recorded, which could lead to minor waste streams and slippery paths.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated showers of tropical rain will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday.
The torrential rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and persist throughout Wednesday.
There will be several major temperature fluctuations across the U.S. in October as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain fairly warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic temperature changes in a short distance.
The central U.S. region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
October is expected to begin with heat in much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there is a high chance that above-average temperatures will be recorded in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million viewers watched on Thursday the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was broadcast on six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters disrupting Friday's usual schedule due to a last-minute turn of events: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers are likely to have seen this testimony on Friday.
The company averaged viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Audience numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN, or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has trouble calculating the number of people who see it from his office.
Put in perspective, this is an audience similar to that of an American football playoff game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the network with the highest audience, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the whole day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS earned $3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC $2.89 million and CNN $2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was berated by protesters as he attempted to climb an elevator to go to a hearing of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake remained several minutes with his eyes peeled as he was filmed live on CNN television.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said, ‘You have power, while there are so many women who don’t!’
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, commented that he would have more to say in view of the committee.
Within hours, all cable and broadcast channels were already broadcasting live the moment the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote on whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary for a vote.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee ahead of next week, a condition demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had influence, as it was evident that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and of disregarding national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party congress in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview in addition to the one carried out with May on the front page of the newspaper, the former foreign affairs minister of May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, where he states that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect each other taxes is "absolutely absurd".
The Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson in Death of LSU Team Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who served on the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and claim they found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted that Wayde was shot dead, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge district coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, Southern University Police, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that culminated in this arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area's law enforcement for their "diligence and to seek justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He averaged 1.98 m, played wing and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU team basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "shattered" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
“Things like this are what make you suffer at all times,” Wade said.
A volcano spews ash in Mexico City
The ash spilled by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was overseeing several bursts and tremors that had occurred recently.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-riot police and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the Catalonian vote on their secession.
A group of pro-independence individuals detained by riot police began throwing eggs and powder paint at them, causing dark dust clouds to appear on the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later the same day, there were clashes with the police, who used their batons to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups sang "We don't forget, we don't forgive" face to face with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not eased in this region of independence-minded a year after a referendum was held on October 1 considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by the Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a very large majority, although the turnout rate was low, as opponents of secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to halt the vote by entering polling stations across the region, sparking violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the chances of Catalonia achieving independence.
“We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents cry with joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck.”
Despite achieving a vital victory, albeit by little margin, in the autonomous elections last December, Catalan independence parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, given that many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been stoked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is only increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since late last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting himself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and the repression that we have seen on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after hitting a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has fired a crossbow at the car.
A play by Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston was a win.
Livingston, who had risen this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what is just the second loss of Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the club of the neighborhood of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's move made the difference, as with this victory, the team of Gary Holt climbed to the second position, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team, on the other hand, continue without winning away from home in the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they are separated by an eight-point gap.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends his unbeaten streak to six games in the league, with a Holt coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
The Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the direct game of the visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead of the scoreboard long before the goal, as his direct play caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way through the defense, but wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the goal. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow sent the ball out as he lay down to try to finish the header of Craig Halkett, who crossed the goal.
The locals were already going to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew that they could put visitors in trouble in isolated moves.
That’s how that decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a foul against the Rangers' interests and Livingston made an overture to the side, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play first and finish from the central part of the area.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the possession, but he found an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game.
The stage was repeated in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a merit stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman on one occasion and Lithgow finished off another Livingston combination play.
The Rangers spent time hanging balls in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for an alleged entry of Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for hands. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top tier, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good band of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be on the lookout for Menga throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments displayed with Gerrard as coach, they have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They did not know how to create chances (only once they clearly overtook the local defense), and this the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should take as a warning.
A bittersweet reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
This city has the world’s largest population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered in the vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard while condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinion around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and called a dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist has died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics attended the cyclist, he died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed in a runaway crash on Childers Street, about a mile (1.6 km) from the crash site on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said their officers were working to identify the man and report the incident to his closest relatives.
The street has been cut and detours have been applied for bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in altercation
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation at the high-security men's prison, according to the center's office.
The incident occurred at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, at about 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday, and continues.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the scene to end the altercation, in which eight inmates have been implicated. The riot has been contained on one side.
Officers had to be treated for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: “We have deployed specially trained prison staff to try to resolve an incident at Long Martin Prison, which still lingers.
Six employees had to be treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to be held accountable to the police and may have to spend even more time in jail.”
The Long Lartin Penitentiary holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was learned that the head of the prison had to be treated in a hospital after being attacked by a detainee.
In addition, in October last year, anti-riot agents came to the prison to settle a serious altercation in which staff of the center were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major floods (dry areas could benefit)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early next week when what is left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The national weather service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and approach Monday night with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the tropical storm or depression state within a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 64 km from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rainfall, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, could record from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are out of risk of floods, the rain of the Rosa could become very good news, given that the region suffers a strong drought.
Although flooding is a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with peak winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northwards at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, causing it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with a tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before reaching the border with Arizona early Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from the Rosa or what remains of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Agents have called for anyone who may have some kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone to get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejection of the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said in an election in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford of sexually abusing her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in connection with his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that, that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the bravery" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable track record of service to the public,” he said.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of the Republican voter turnout rate in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn’t run, but I did,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are engaged in “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant Republican party leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, and many have been dragged by giant waves hitting beaches, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast at dusk, dragging many people to their deaths and shattering everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not run right away. That’s why they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it wrecked everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
There are people who climbed a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency show the number of shops and buildings destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The protests continued to rock this coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's technology appraisal and application agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased exponentially the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped in the debris of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
According to Nugroho, the deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications "were totally paralyzed and therefore no information was arriving" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, and it could end in a much worse way,” he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a fan shared on social media, you can hear how a man on the top floor of a building gives desperate cries of warning to street people about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water explodes on the seashore, taking away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread power cut that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, the evacuees are still in desperate need of food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city’s airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where employees shelter in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the heartbreaking gesture of initiating relief work, some people complained that it was preventing aid workers from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and staffing from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘Well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start calling for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared.”
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the missing people kept hopeful that the miracle would happen and their loved ones would evade the devastating tale of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was rescued trapped in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under debris for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team of paragliders, had trained two of the paragliders missing for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional charge,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel circulated among the paraglider community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means that the messages were not received,” he added.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Officer Dennis McCarthy said in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his homework, another man "runs behind the employee of Brink's" and stole a bag of money destined for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote, "The being formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons", according to the show's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ye is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” West said earlier this year, as he talked about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I’ve gone from Kanye, which means the one, to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former collaborator, has used his nickname with or without a hyphen and in capital letters.
Mexico's President AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that “never again will military force be used to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its AI funding.
“As China becomes increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on AI research,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government announced measures on AI, despite a general lack of formal AI strategy in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubting the AI research budget would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the U.S. and we want to be the pioneers of upcoming advances in the field of AI,” Lee said.
“Doubling funding could double the chances for the U.S. to achieve the next big discovery in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that surpassed the top-ranked American Othello player and subsequently served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee positively valued previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
“Often, American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, “It’s not China that takes away the academic leaders; it’s the companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that U.S. work in the field of AI could also be boosted by changes in immigration policy.
“I think permanent residency cards should be automatically offered to AI doctoral students,” he added.
In July 2017, China’s State Council presented its state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
“The National Natural Science Foundation of China grants funds to individuals from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other U.S. public bodies give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior in China,” Lee said.
Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve collaborators from industry and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently allocates more than $100 million a year to AI research.
In the meantime, no measures have been implemented for months in relation to U.S. legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the name of the country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the name change to "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raises doubts about whether the minimum participation required for the referendum to be valid will be reached at 50%.
The question in the referendum ballot is: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
Zaev said a "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum turnout required.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian channel Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote “yes”.
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, makes a goal after dribbling all the defense of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory in the match at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He went for speed between three defenses of Brighton, sweeping with what came his way through the field of play.
Afterwards, Agüero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He dribbled a defender before overtaking a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that he found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, to Agüero, who with his right leg beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot that snuck into the net from the right side.
“Agüero has discomfort at the foot,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided that we would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League fight.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Aguero received the ball in depth in the field of Brighton and
made a beautiful space pass on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long post.
The Sky Blues frontman finished the ball inside the net before leaving for the bottom line.
City face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 18:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to come out on the pitcher's heap next Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to play the play-offs.
The Rockies secured a wild card with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still seeking their first division title.
“Although we’re not playing anything, we can at least go out and pitch knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably play each point at the highest level, like no one has done this year.
“Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals have yet to announce an opening pitcher for Sunday, but are apparently determined to let Scherzer pitch if this situation arises.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th overture, did a warm-up session on Thursday and would pitch Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big .. I don’t introduce myself, but actually I do. That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all necessary means, their pettiness, their evil intention is seen.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But we won’t give them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to “resist and obstruct.”
“And this can be seen in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, dirty and false.”
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which sparked a strong public outcry.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what?
“No, no, wait a minute... That was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party must cease to be a diverse party.
He is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, I wasn’t surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of British MPs who have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she spoke out with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the no-confidence motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of Friday's meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party it was communicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “more generous and kind” policies, if ever, has long been forgotten.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a similar political vision expected me to take a 180-degree turn and take positions that I would never have taken, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, center politics being denounced, and I’m told I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the messages I receive are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who have to deal with a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and do not break down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every “no confidence” motion or every change in the rules of selection, the party is tightening more.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and have been advised to keep my head down, not to be so expressive and “everything would be okay”.
I didn’t go into politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, spurred by Thatcher’s negligent government, which left my entire class literally sunk, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayrs lead the lead
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved victory in this vibrant Tennent's Premiership day game.
The Ayrs, who are the only unbeaten team of the ten, occupy the first position on the leaderboard.
In the end, the local team prevailed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to take better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
“The games we’ve played so far have put us to the test and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie commented: “Congratulations to the Ayrs, they’ve taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayrs ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, loaned for the game by the Warriors, allowed the Melroses to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty and, just in the middle, scored and converted a trial to put the score 17-5 in favor of Ayr at rest.
But the Melroses got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
After the match was interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired on a bunk, and at the resumption the Ayrs again extended the distance with a rehearsal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Substitute Captain Blair Macpherson was then cautioned with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of one more man's superiority with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to tackle Climo without a ball, from the penalty lineup, MacPherson scored a counter-trial behind the Ayrs' penetrating mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the resumption, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to third wing Gregor Henry to score the home team's fifth try.
The star of the series Still Game seems to be ready to start a new career in the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears to be poised to move into the hospitality sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comic partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source at The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flowering catering sector".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, landlocked, waits for the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a navy blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are pampered with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Around the landlocked territory of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still very vivid, as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, it looks forward to the result with a positive stance,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IJT’s resolution on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes placed in Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The U.N. body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The IJC resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were presented, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a retreat in the last four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,” he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Will Not Happen Unless It Can Trust U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly last Saturday.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a chimera to think that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War could make North Korea ever kneel.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament moves sooner.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the question of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of oversized hats, en route to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you do not need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented at the catwalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been ravaged by very impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the models' heads.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of whimsical masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the brightly colored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete scuba diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another resembled a molten ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The large hats tread the heels of “La Bomba”, a straw hat, with a wide two-footed wing, that everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult tag behind the hat so impractical that it spread across social media brought another great creation to the runway: a beach straw bag, almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia hoops and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame if the demand for oversized accessories were ignored.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence that has continued into 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages lead the ranking tables with the highest ratings in independent schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who studied foreign languages scored higher.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in curricula from independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK’s Employment and Competence Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave for the cost of filling vacancies, 17% was attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important jobs.
In Scotland there is diversity among schools in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, you can always choose from a number of languages in independent schools, which have teaching staff specializing in this area.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment of today, there is no denying that languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered “international communicative competences”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play his first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we still have to figure out how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court is on hold, Trump aims to secure support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s rally in West Virginia can be watched online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing that began this week with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained over allegations of sexual abuse he faces, while the Senate’s planned confirmation vote remains on hold for up to a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans running in the delicate November election gain momentum.
So President Trump’s five campaign rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and enlarge the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can as we head into a busy campaign season,” a Trump spokesman said.
Tonight’s rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together supporters “from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows ambition to keep hopes alive for Sunday's individual matches
After three uneven sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is an invented sporting concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
On what side is the positive dynamic now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I think we’re on a small positive run,” Jordan Spieth said as he departed at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind blows a little in their favor and have plenty of reasons to be cheerful, largely because of the shape state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural screams of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his lap and put a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game at hole 15 with a similar outcry, of the kind that indicates he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
“You have to work hard and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave an imprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't do a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
Because of this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the bustling public, it is reaffirmed that it is the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly broke up with Sergio Garcia, the morning furball hero, who partnered with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes plunged the Spanish and Swedish into a hole from which they never had a choice.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see for the interactions between pairings, the tips they give and the ones they don’t, and the way a strategy can change suddenly.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with a significant advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reaches Ryder Cup final with favourable score of 10-6
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after ending Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a struggling Tiger Woods and leave their record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an unlucky American team in the morning fourballs and put the series at 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not narrow the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known by the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they put together a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged in two games on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, rejoined Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2–1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have it all in sight on a pleasant and windy day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time champion of the tournament, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday by scoring two points.
They secured a determined 2–1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history had a team scored a four-point difference in individual matches, although the title-defending Furyk team only needed to draw to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack next Sunday is out of his reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm 'in any way' if signs of confidence are not appreciated
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying its distrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing center and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we are not observing any response in line with the U.S.,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way.”
While Ri resumed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action gradually, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral full denuclearization, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization must occur first and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our distrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: “If the party involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation situation.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year’s, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President “Mr. Evil” Trump dubbed Kim “Rocket Man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the application of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously pushed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took “measures in line.”
He said Kim had told him that the "measures in line" he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on resting habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of studying throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar noted that students at the world’s number one university are often skewed about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, all this, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, implemented for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts on how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, which lasts one hour, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, dolls and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects sports performance to lack of sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying awake all night long still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure students face make sleep deprivation an ever-increasing problem.
Making sure you enjoy good quality sleep for long enough should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes in his final year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask graduate students to pursue a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston's home that means another trip away.
The Ibrox team sought to add their first home win since last February's 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second loss on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team drifting, 8 points behind the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before halftime, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equalize the score.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climb to third place, behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently threw itself off the stand.
Gerrard made eight changes from the lineup that swept the Ayrs in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same headline eleven that tore off a point against the Hearts last week. Surely, he felt satisfied by the way his team, well organized, choked their rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder kicked off and missed the great opportunity.
A blunt Keaghan Jacobs foul shot met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot to the back post.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a penalty at the 15-minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only managed two shots to goal in the first half, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi's first act in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' worked-up play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break in changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change had a practically immediate impact, as the end made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran to the blockade.
However, the Livingston continued to capture the attention of visitors by playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's side may have given up the lead in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a deflected shot from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page in the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually resulted in the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has been a mainstay of science ever since, also became a stack of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, a seemingly failed cowboy physicist:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.

New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ and Kill Malignant Cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize these malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject them
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2), and subsequently re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, “The results we obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein "favors the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West became entangled in a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL show.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was shouted at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began to criticize Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, they say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee for allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well-treated behind the scenes because of the cap he wore.
“I was threatened behind the scenes.
I was told not to go out with that hat on.
They besieged me.
And then they say I’m in a lower position,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the lower position?" as he said that he would put on Superman's cloak because then they wouldn't be able to tell him what to do.
Try to love.”
His comments provoked the outcry of the public at least twice and the members of the show's team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter who explained to the publication: "The entire study was completely mute."
West acted as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West baffled much of the audience with the performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West secured the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR OUTSTANDING THE MULTITUDE."
But debate show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful."
“But I have chosen not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or by supporting their ‘art’) who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the defunct music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday in eastern Belfast.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for playing the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of a manly hero, saying that these roles imply that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said he believed "something had gone wrong" and that he was questioning how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that he is quite determined to tackle this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity," he says.
“What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?”
According to Kit, television may have some responsibility for the rise in toxic masculinity due to its virile characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to have this facet of virility?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series' ending is scheduled for next summer, saying he is fed up with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best thing that Game of Thrones has ever given him.
“I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life onwards,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health workers.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV from this cause has fallen to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health workers at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Considering the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who maintain same-sex relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican senators’ data and dismantles “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the lawsuits were pushed by critics and far-right websites.
“Lies, lies and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was posted by an unknown person at the Capitol during a Senate committee session on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to Waters' office and that it revealed information from a member of Waters' staff, the Capitol reported.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and a pure lie," Waters continued.
“My staff member, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this information leak.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a pure invention.”
Waters's statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of indignation,” wrote Fleischer.
“That makes you think you don’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they should not be angry.
It doesn’t have to be challenging.
He must not question the accuser's motives.
You have to be calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"I don't care if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the offenders are revealed," he continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all actions they have taken that have harmed each and every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again: Limited Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this remake of the Johnny English comedy-action parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satisfaction about how despicable we are will be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent of outgoing eyes and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to twist everything. His name indicates more than anything else that it is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Carros de fuego at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson depicting Barclaycard’s now-forgotten TV commercials, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this last journey of JE.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the blades of the propeller chirped at his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is seen, but the humor seems rather loose and strangely superfluous, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems intended for children rather than adults and, to me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as ingenious or focused as the mute gags of the Mr. Bean character depicted by Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret web spy network and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the dismay of the service agent, a woefully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and besieged figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this cast character of Teresa-May, but the script does not reach more.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy puts himself in danger, he will have to recover some retired one.
And that includes the clumsy Johnny English, now employed as a teacher at some fancy institution, but giving unofficial classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his henchman sufferer Bough, a role which he returns to represent Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
When things get very ugly in Her Majesty's secret service, Batman and Robin come into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French fast food restaurant, they sow chaos by smuggling aboard the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes great confusion when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the interior of the house of Volta.
All the stops have certainly been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, everything seems like a children's program.
Pretty normal stuff.
As with the other Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to think whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is putting together a plan for the British to have a four-day work week and cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week and pay five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of the companies to pass on the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them one more day of holiday.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would receive the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The change to a four-day working week is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to take advantage of economic change.
An experienced Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favor of the worker and into the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: “A four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it.”
Shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to utilities.
The shadow minister's plans also imply that the shareholders of the water companies may not recover all the investment, as the Labour government could apply "deductions" for crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to hand over 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" whether Kavanaugh's FBI investigation could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I’m serious,” Kennedy said.
"I said at the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had done so.
He was firm, determined, and secure.”
But Graham’s vote seems burned to the ground.
“I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would make an explosive accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people I name will be able to verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, which presents an absolutely impressive program of stars, who carry out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
For the seventh time this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help actively combat it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What achievements has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case of what we call “clictivism” (people who think it makes a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, which have helped achieve several goals.
These actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will have impacted the lives of more than 2.2 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based association of investors and filmmakers, which pledges to “help children grow as much as possible” and pledges to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the Q&As on his website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements of the past, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, “if necessary” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed.
Zinke has denounced Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
“The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are indeed equal.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to harness and replace fuels,” he said, noting that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has cost US$11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's ardent opposition to the project is simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (FDI), has called on the US to move away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industries Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will “think carefully” about her candidacy for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “think hard” about her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government divide, for women to hold high office,” she said.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president seriously."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the city meeting and said he was “bringing the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m frankly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticisms of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “It is clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters believed he should not run by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters have said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed broader support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who were considered in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to The Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Quotes PTSD Affected Track Palin at Donald Trump Meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“With what my own son has been going on since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from ramifications of PTSD and some of the emotional wounds with which our soldiers are returning,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "They come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed an amicus curiae Friday in Washington to support a policy-defying asylum seeker, according to NBC News.
The full name of the lawsuit in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the gang member" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the US, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
Federal laws require that asylum claims be adjudicated according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy of denying immigrant entry hurts the U.S. economy as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant further asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never sought to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts at Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
“The atmosphere is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she reassured her son with a fever at an evacuation center in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There is no drinking water.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to grab flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
Hundreds have been injured, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 quake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are treated outside due to repeated heavy shaking.
Tears shook his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife crying for help and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don’t know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassment with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily’s payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the Iowa state’s best-selling newspaper, on Wednesday after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. Congressional election, an accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase in Washington’s campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to insert ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an intensifying trade war that has seen tariffs on mutual imports rise.
China’s revenge tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters from states, such as Iowa, that supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the longtime U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in The Sunday's The Des Moines Register: "It is redoubling the harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press."
“In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of free speech and free press to insert a paid advertisement in The Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese citizens may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was dodging the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans set aside women voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can’t be undone,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for a paper that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute pressure for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, or tomorrow, or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants shouted "november is coming!" as they marched in the Senate lobby as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be off the chart,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
“People say they’ve already been tall; it’s true.
But it could have been more, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often don’t vote until they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, detailing his sexual assault lawsuits against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the GOP,” former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench. It’s also about how the Republicans have handled this issue and how they have treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's stele and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with the balance leaning slightly towards the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents unquestionably or likely believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they unquestionably or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or unquestionably lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating lawsuits filed by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the influence of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez complains that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is unique to the personal online data store is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is for the company to integrate adequate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some on-board developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said no one on his team is talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are emptied completely overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a Saturday post in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the cleric of the Cross Victory of the I GM
The only clergyman of the Church of England to win a Victory Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honour.
His two grandchildren uncovered a commemorative tombstone at a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under intense gun and machine gun fire".
Later he ran towards the line of fire and, with "maximum bravery" advanced the line before throwing himself on a cannon with one hand and leaving astonished three members of the detachment.
The lieutenant colonel was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never match, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who slept all night to watch Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 and be denied the most important event.
The San Jose poster contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and were to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the showdown, UK spectators were stunned when the schedule changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted that they had spent the night awake until dawn to watch the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the move to cartoons as "a kind of vomiting joke".
“Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they switched to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communication, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
"But there it is six o'clock on a Sunday morning and we will not be able to solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at his.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will leave it in five fights, instead of six as we usually do. We tried to show it again for the fans, but it was over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to other people because of his sexuality, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she talked about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father had taken away his importance in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" others because "it was not socially acceptable like boys and girls".
“To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when his sexuality was discovered.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "caught me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you go so far as to be young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple were parents in June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "their whole outlook" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold,” he said.
“There are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
Her son is named after her father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked for was if they already had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘father, you won’t be there to take the first row,’” he said.
"As I held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in an Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud by Heather Small), which he had heard during preparation for the Olympics and which still gave him the goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worsened Mickelson showed up at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical condition if he doesn’t want to become an unhappy goal.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" modalities.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has been customary for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments allocates his time between cheering and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough usually punishes the deflected blows.
And if his own trajectory isn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
“He perfectly understood his role for that day, he slapped me on the back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me I would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I couldn’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like anybody else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that has not matched your individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has contributed intangibles to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, joking, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great partner for the team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were having fun with him this week too, which has been fun to see.
He brings a lot more out of his game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage may soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a hard day.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they won by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a big advantage at Valderrama; we had a big advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but by little," Bjorn said in the image, after seeing the 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the scoreboard in 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History has taught me and all the members of the team that it is not over yet.
Tomorrow you have to go to every machine.
You have to go out and do it all right.
This doesn’t end until the points go up on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, to try to win the trophy, and we have to stay focused to do that.
I have already said, I focus on the 12 players that we have in the team, but I also have in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world.
Delighted with the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performance will make the difference and change everything.
It’s great to be with a partner when everything goes well, but individual duels test your ability to play golf to the fullest.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this moment, you leave your partner and he has to go out and also get the best out of himself.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the last day's lifts, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he said when asked how 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players before the final day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start on a good foot, as it was seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the line-up according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has the challenge to attempt to start the comeback against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities,” Bjorn says of his selection for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it will not do so at least until next year as a result of faulty systems and increased cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other notable features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without passing through domestic ports.
However, these continued delays imply that the vanguard ships, which were expected to be able to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details of the reasons for his return are known, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that rendered it useless if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are significant, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew required for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the ship's weight is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to weigh twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, given recent warnings that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used".
The officer said the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were discontinued, but no new ones were provided as spare parts.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret lives of bats
New research on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed.
The findings are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, as well as northern ear bats and water bats in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a habitat map will be created to create a detailed landscape-scale image of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation adviser at the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Building and restoration work threatens bats as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do fly paper and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts with the appropriate training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues on a regular basis.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The estate's administrator, David Thompson, states that it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Threave, we have a great area for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a whole good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young people, which could result in the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, annoy, and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to step forward to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data on their population.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the rape allegations against him are "fake news" and said people "want to become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, which is responsible for publishing the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 at the time for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed they were "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner on camera.
“They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I’m a happy man and everything is in order,” he added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have labeled as “inadmissible information of suspicion about private life,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed at Clark County Courthouse, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good guy", except a "1%".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but they were consented to.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed of injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “afraid of reprisals” and worried about “being publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to overturn the agreement as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he has signed for Juve, the Italian giant, in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million operation.
Brexit: UK 'would always regret' losing car manufacturers
The UK would “always regret it” if it loses its status as the world’s leading manufacturer after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary for Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that, if the UK left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal by the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU countries will work has stirred fears from other UK car manufacturers such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for automobile manufacturing.
If the UK leaves the European Union without reaching a deal on March 29, there may be riots at the border, which the sector believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be halted as a result.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
“We have to reach an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“Testing not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union at the plant, said members are starting to be very concerned about the situation: “By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
White House says meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed
Donald Trump’s long-awaited meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for a week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues in White House remarks on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Russia and aid to Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general and jeopardizes Mueller’s independence has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of bringing a microphone to record the conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, it was announced for Thursday a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be one more week late for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might refute this claim: Sanders has not held any White House briefings since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lack of information sessions was not because he did not like the boastfulness of television journalists, although he said: "I will not deny that they are boastful."
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president does more Q&A sessions than any previous president,” he said, before adding the following without citing any source: “We have consulted these data.”
Sanders has stated that the briefings will continue to take place, but “if the press has the ability to ask the president of the United States directly, it is far infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and they will replace the briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are infrequent.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal and, at times, strange appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service amid fears of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wishes them to continue there after Brexit.
Scottish MEP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of residence status applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems headed towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know these are convulsive times for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Partners in the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting patients and the communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers' Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Tennessean's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him on a stretcher and taking him away for further testing.
A Tennessee State official has reported Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is the first season of Abercrombie's second year with Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people under the Conservative Party’s new plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s movement to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taxed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The government expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help homeless people.
A higher bell tax is expected to be levied on foreign buyers when buying a property in the UK and that money will be used to help homeless people, a move Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taxed on those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will go to government action to combat homelessness figures.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculation, could be as high as 3%.
The government expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's newly built properties are from non-British residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for novice buyers to make their way to the property ladder.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the bell tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused large builders of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on rents and the completion of evictions “without blame.”
He also wants to give more power to municipalities to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the indignity of the homeless makes it all the more real.”
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to coach Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his "highest ambition" is to be the coach of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has accepted the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which currently occupies the third position in League One, three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called in once for support and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound program.
“But I grew up watching a lot of playing Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was little and it’s always something that makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I’m successful in coaching clubs, though.”
Ross's predecessors in the Sunderland coaching role include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach claims that he does not feel the pressure to be next on a list of names consecrated to such a large team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be whether I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
"With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that their place is in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I’ve been successful here if I can get the club back.”
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a stint as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third category and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the post at Alloa.
“I’ve always thought that training was the best thing I could do, rather than playing.
It sounds weird because I did well, I got away with it reasonably, and I enjoyed enough good times.
Playing can be very hard.
There are a lot of things you need to get through every week.
I still spend it on things like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve felt since I was an adult.”

The perfect time for a comb is 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave has triggered consumption in struggling bars in Britain, but has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants fell by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the financial advisory CGA, the company that has collected the data, says the following: "The continuous hours of sunshine and the participation of England in the World Cup, which has been longer than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except for restaurants, have still suffered.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption at restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have obtained the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, from RSM’s Recreation and Hospitality Analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors related to sales of the outdoor leisure market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decline in sales of 4.8% year-on-year would be especially damaging, rather than the continued pressure on costs.
“This long and hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food-service businesses and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide this much-needed breath.”
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those opened recently, was 2.7% in July, indicating the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sector sales indicator for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 million and is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in the "fake Insta" pages
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a "principal" account that they show their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in “fake Insta” accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a clean "main" account that they show their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, of which half have admitted to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation's board of directors
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation's board of directors at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most medal-winning field and track athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am very much looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I look forward to being able to grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular commentator for the BBC, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what degree.
It has been exhausting, but I have recovered completely, I have learned to walk again and today it is time to do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
An ad that compares mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A teaser company has divided opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows who are grappling.
To mark the launch of what is considered the “world’s first silent carry-on teaser,” consumer tech company Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a prank music video to show the freedom that the new teaser gives to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of fodder and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I'm sticking to myself, but you won't see a tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed, they're not bragueres, but my breasts".
The return continues: "Bubbles, pumps, feeds babies, pumps, pumps, mops girls."
However, the announcement, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixture of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim it shows the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth,” one person wrote.

Another commented the following: "Understandably traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a tie rod for mothers who will keep their babies?”
Another user added: "It's an out-of-place announcement."
Others defended the ad; one woman admitted to finding the song "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Pumping for the puller made me feel exactly like I was a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but you have to take it for what it is.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another person commented on the following: "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump with teaspoons (usually at their workplace or in the bathroom and feel like they're cows.
It’s not an announcement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the strap discreetly placed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say that they feel like cows when they use the leash.
However, the Elvie strap is completely silent, has no wire or tube and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women more freedom to move around, hold babies and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and early childhood developer at Mother, said: “The Elvie toy is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
By tracing the parallel between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a pullover is used and the challenges involved, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pullover.
This isn’t the first time Elvis has appeared in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased even though monthly entries across the border have remained virtually stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid of putting at risk their chance of staying in the country if they decided to take in a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to take in unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who have hosted or live in the home of a person who has hosted are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
To prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to report to court within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than face-to-face, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for aid will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent rampages or escape attempts, according to workers and reports released by the system in recent months.
Lawyers say these concerns can intensify in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked due to their size.
They added that moving children to camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or saying goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges ‘occupation forces’ of US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war on terror is practically over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has displaced millions.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have purged all Syrian territory” from both terrorist groups and from “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said conditions were good for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears" that make refugees want to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favoured the opportunity to continue political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russian help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will confront the jihadists, which include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to begin shaping a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 election again unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, the scandals and the impeachment process end his presidency prematurely.
“This would be the end of the most dramatic presidency in history.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers at peak viewing hours has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on peak viewing hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"People have been bumped into it because they don't understand it," said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election?
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
"He told me 'cause I made him laugh,'" Scovell said.
There is a point of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go further when you find yourself in the sixth hour of seeing a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of sources “for private use” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar ostrich-skin jacket (“a piece of thick clothing” from the postman’s headlines)—and he’s done them with his pride.
I don’t think I’ll ever see Super Mario again.
“Part of what makes it seem like it’s part of a reality show is that every night it gives you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the character changes and script twists of Trump’s show (fighting with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode because you're left behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house he has on the north coast of Kauai, but he got stuck watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away with it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to confront the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing those crazy shows back then and people were saying it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but they were right.”

External money floods the races for the tightest midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that there’s a cash flood in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has forced two current members to compete for the same square.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburgh involves Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district following a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which comes into conflict with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the party’s main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a long-running special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
Republicans have been in office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support to China, but withdraws them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners ousted the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions about no longer recognizing Taiwan,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received in 2017 US aid of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements, was contemplated.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death tolls for murder and unemployment.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending with any likelihood of sanctioning El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, scheduled now for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to their posts in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman in Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, which included two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also anonymously, corroborated the statements.
Study history
The next event to occur could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is numerous evidence in public records.
Mueller is also investigating whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be held accountable to the organization, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
These are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the downfall of Trump, or any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates at turning points such as this and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The United States is currently facing several turning points.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been on the run since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that he was not fit for office.
Rosenstein claims that the Times' information is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to be in danger.
But I don’t think we will fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic for the match against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw on the field of Villarreal this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify in the group of G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first few minutes of the season until a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten something more out of it at the end, but overall, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it is another great European night.
We hope to be able to keep the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they took a good result in the last match, but I am sure we will give everything and get a good result with the support of the fans.
“Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is fine and the guys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it our all, put it behind us last season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with their family.
Approximately half of respondents nationwide say they have talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents say they have spoken to their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t dare to raise it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
We have to start here.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenses, or an insurance of your own with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the way for legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notarial proxy for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of disability.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specifies these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"Finance is not the only factor that needs to be determined, but also which doctors you want to deal with," Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready.”
Man shot several times with a compressed air shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots from a compressed air shotgun while returning home after going out at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
"Officials have described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (British summer time), as a 'random act'.
The victim did not see the attacker.
Her life is not in danger from the injuries and police have called to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The death toll is expected to increase.
As communications are cut off, rescue units have been unable to obtain information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Celebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency extending along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region lower than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami struck west of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Belt of Fire and earthquakes occur frequently.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Ace province, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that shattered the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck a poppy area of the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that shattered dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died from the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the tourist Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake shattered thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled the phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Provisional Detention Center, where he is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he pleaded "not guilty, with certainty" when asked how he pleaded, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A fouls, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His wife said he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups for associating her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck Indonesia’s island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the coming days.
The quake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos with the moment of the impact are circulating on social networks.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Call for Exceptional Death Penalty for Suspect in New York Terror Attack
New York state prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists during his journey in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a 22-fault indictment that included eight murder charges for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they told investigators they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
According to police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of wrongdoing.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a conviction and life imprisonment with no possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be Put in Charge of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should “feel pressure from Eurosceptics” when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested she should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when pro-union conservatives have come forward in yet another anti-Brexit protest in La City.
The prime minister is struggling to preserve her Chequers compromise plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
The allies insist that it will manage to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave meeting that he wanted to undo Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out already," he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we must undo the Chequers’ commitment.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mindset and want to stay is totally false."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: “I’m just telling you, Prime Minister, listen to the people.”
“Chequers’ commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition won’t vote for it, it’s unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who take to the streets and get us to win an election.
Give up the Chequers commitment and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said that the politicians at the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.”
“We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners about the anti-Brexit Conservatives after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security concerns they suffered with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He has been the center of speculation about the possibility of relegating Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open meeting format since Trump took office.
An aide asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for "women to go to Washington to repair our government that is not working, and that includes a woman at the top."
A person arrested for the shooting death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge Police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of the LSU Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at the ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head that eventually killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody to the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2-metre junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes team’s orders would play an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel pitted earlier and let Hamilton run with traffic on the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to pit and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to abandon the free inside with the risk of being left out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap he was in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position much of the race as he retained his wheels to save time, advance Kimi Raikkonen and move into fourth position.
Eventually he entered the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase the pace the following eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It’s a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job to have a one-two," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "bad, cruel, and liars."
“Something that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate these last few days, when you see anger, when you see people angry, bad, cruel and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the releases and the leaks and they say, ‘No, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document? "Eh, what?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked ... No, we didn’t leak it,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, as he asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to have power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite loss to the Belfast Giants as they won the 5–3 return game at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-goal lead thanks to the goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied the Dundee. Then two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won the Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assist by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this turbulent initial period, Sullivan placed the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first half when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the match at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after dying to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have gone missing after a major earthquake rocked the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are taking place in the area and there are many people trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his companions escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place in the shaky control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take the flight safely.
Afterwards, he left the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
An Indonesian representative for Air Navigation, Yohannes Sirait, said this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the debris and many that have not been accessed,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s representative.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, who will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working against the clock to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Aviation crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, though it previously said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, since Saturday afternoon, they did not find a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane docked in the lagoon because the runway was short.
Witnesses say the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
“That was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working nearby to upgrade a pier also assisted in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have been killed in PNG-recorded airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An Analyst Composes a Chronology of the Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness to the intelligence analysis field.
He described to the jury how he used cellphone records to build the movements of the defendant, 29, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said she received location data from different mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting her earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak with Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he had lied, as his van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
Bristol's The High Breed claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put hip-hop conscious back in fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK at the hands of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York babysitter sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' message
A New York babysitter has denounced a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother protesting that she was "another black person."
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed consternation at seeing that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her piffia, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nanny she had fired, who was African American, had done her job poorly and that she expected a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the payment corresponding to her working day and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice claims compensation from the couple for the dismissal and asks for compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month residency work for which they had hired her, even though there was no contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do things like that,” he told the Post on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple has responded to statements that they are racists by stating that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after having offended her.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to "extortion," said his wife had two months left to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to do something like that?
It’s not a very kind attitude,” the investor banker added.
The legal case is still unresolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: "It is difficult to put oneself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It’s so funny now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before having the inspiration to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the rejection of the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "sweet" after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and adds that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; she wasn't a presumptuous one," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you get proud, even if it’s none of your business.
I think that’s how he felt about Paddington’s success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always used to acknowledge Paddington’s own merit.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad would call frequently to say that it was very serious and that they did not expect him to get over it," commented Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"So I got a call from Nad and he told me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medications he had been given to keep his body beating were consuming and coming out of his system.
He had died sooner than planned, and everything was shut down.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I could not scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep the good shape.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience that was going on.
“No one knew,” he said.
My head was flat and my tears were not falling.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her very much.”
Grieving women hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, died.
“I don’t want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile could light up any room.”
However, he quit his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis stated, "I am continually concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "so people know there are people you can go to, they can listen to, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
“He never said he wasn’t feeling well or depressed or anything like that,” he said.
“A couple of days before Christmas we saw a change in attitude.
He touched the bottom on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
He said that his death would be a great trauma for them, but that they must work it out: "It opens a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we have to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday. He also added that he feared the committee would be destroyed with the ingrained dead end of the supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has something to do with the moment.
Only five weeks until the November 6 midterm elections. If, as expected, the Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened in getting the man they want elected to go to the main court of the country.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and pressure them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to undo the tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "caused" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and rising prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Usually, the vast majority of North Korean defectors are offered South Korean nationality.
Seoul sources claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrant defectors illegal, rather than refugees, and often repatriates them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South, which technically are still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the halted negotiations on denuclearization.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "hysterical" and unfit to work at the High Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and that his temperament incapacitates him to work in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted in this way, she would have been told she is a ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in connection with her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and speechless as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the charges against him amounted to a "grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the High Court, as it showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“This is what I can say: If you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you are not only not qualified to be in the High Court, but also not in the court where you are now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about any decisions Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she considers herself a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he dodged questions about whether he would override certain decisions of the High Court.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to come into court and hope that we find it wonderful,” Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury, and he cannot take it away without weeping.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. And you?"
She continued... "It helped me a lot a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, saying to the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a male majority, where I once ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of an older woman (a cold manager who had always terrified me a little) who grabbed me from the neck and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad, because they’ll have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me while laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Somebody said, "White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As she was late in the campaign, she was lagging behind with fundraising, so she promised she would not enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give $250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and targeting voters, rather than delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she was speechless.
“You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the reaction of the press.
“You might have thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?
"Was she crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial salves of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the war does not seem to be ending soon, a distancing of countries may prove beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed taxes on China’s major exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth USD 200 billion. These tariffs involve a taxation on half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has repeatedly counter-attacked in the same way and recently raised tariffs from five percent to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pledged to replicate the U.S. and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to be pulled back anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means giving in to some demands, but publicly bowing down to the US would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than witnesses had anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, Asia-centered research associate at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists shattered to restore normalcy.
All conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and maintenance.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.

The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European national team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American national team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the kick into the water in the par 3 16 hole, which yielded the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his series and became one of four players to have scored 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with a 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best-qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2–1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
“I’m so happy, so glad I got the cup back.
The team is the most important... And I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the relay to compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. national team struggled all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-end golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of these players, they’ve fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressed the European selection.
We fought.
I'll take my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players have played well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to have been their captain.
There's a hat to take off.
They have defeated us.”
