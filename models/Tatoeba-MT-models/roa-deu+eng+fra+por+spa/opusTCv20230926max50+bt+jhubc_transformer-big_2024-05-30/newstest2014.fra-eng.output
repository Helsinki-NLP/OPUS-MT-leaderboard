Spectacular wingsuit jump over Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter over the Colombian capital Bogota.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a suit with wings), it passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate Sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many people had gathered to observe his achievement.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners struggle to find the money needed to repair decaying highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that hangs over your car’s dashboard.
The devices, which record every mile driven by a motorist and pass the information on to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and government offices to reshape the outdated system of funding major U.S. highways.
The generally uninteresting sector of major axes planning has suddenly provoked lively debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The tea party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and expresses concern about privacy.
And while members of Congress can’t agree on whether to continue, several states haven’t waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental ride.
This is really essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which expects the state to start recording miles driven by every Californian driver by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded by taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gas tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently had tracers installed on 500 cars to test a mileage payment system.
“This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this mileage usage fee.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to city liberals, as taxes could be used to change driving habits to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state’s ambitious laws on global warming.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also saw it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Reason’s free market supporters also appreciate the idea of charging drivers per mile.
“It’s not just a tax going into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The move is also backed by two former U.S. secretaries of transportation who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the mileage route.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that reportedly covered about 10,000 cars.
But the presidency of the House killed the proposal, addressing concerns from rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to their work or to the city.
Several states and major cities, however, are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country’s most important experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state mileage fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is looking at how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were worried that the government could follow their every move.
“The worries about Big Brother and things like that are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the test, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.”
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily comings and goings.
Nevada is one of the few states now struggling to find affordable technology that would let the state know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
It was looking to break into the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she tests have appealed to planners on the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded via modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less costly ways and far less intrusive methods of proceeding.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a plan based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide “pay-for-driving” insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them," said an urban planning document.
However, some transport planners are wondering if the whole debate about mileage is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply handle the Highway Trust Fund’s bankruptcy by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
“There is no need to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a bunch of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unreleased Stories
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, he concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new David Bowie album had left everyone panic.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates from 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that one could still count on him to make the pop scene sparkle.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke will be re-releasing the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will come in the form of three discs: the original album, previously unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe Edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories supplied with: photos and exclusive covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new track Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very forward and a skillfully mastered rock electricity.
Already unheard of
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a luminous cavalcade that gradually slows down to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John’s Rocket Man, or even to Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would it come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, enchanting, make you want to leave the Earth.
In any case, Bowie has fun playing chameleon with these titles: turn-by-turn informant, man aboard a rocket, potential Martian...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in hand in the photograph of the Louis Vuitton Invitation to Travel campaign, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transitional process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the military were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded servicemen - who do not meet the military's "universality of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, has been released from the military despite his request to stay an additional year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case followed that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are not fit for combat.
Under the current rules, severely wounded soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the military.
Data presented last year to Parliament indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service to receive retirement benefits.
Liberal veterans spokesman Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for Corporal Hawkins' reinstatement, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Disney is betting on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to favor tablets over its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie’s Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is only scheduled for 2014, details the statement of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, aimed at children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a city in the American West where she rules the order with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years old have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under 8 years old, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden ready to ‘cooperate’ with Germany on US surveillance issue
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for U.S. intelligence, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he enjoys the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts has obviously been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make sure that this is possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained following complaints that the NSA tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence, said that if there was a chance to hear Snowden as a witness “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States,” we should take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, the German Green MP, posted a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Ströbele said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be reassured that he would be “safe” there, he said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression”.
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have judged the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public utility.
The letter states an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Subscribers to Cogeco Cable may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their TV in the not-so-distant future.
The Cogeco subsidiary said Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” said Louis Audet, President and CEO of Cogeco, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus follows the lead of its competitors, such as Bell, although the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a specific date for this new platform.
"We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in talks with some major cable companies to make its service available through their streaming platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for pay-per-view services.
“We’ve been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chain packages isn’t working,” Audet said.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to some interesting recommendations.
"A new kind of framework will have to emerge from these discussions to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry next spring.
In terms of earnings, Cogeco reported net earnings of $43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82<0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This is a decline from net earnings of $44.9 million, or <0xC2><0xA2>83 per share, for the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by amortization costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the U.S.-based Atlantic Broadband cable company for $1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that failed in Portugal.
In December, the Montreal-based company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entreprises, a Vancouver-based Internet provider, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they grew 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90<0xC2><0xA2> per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93<0xC2><0xA2> per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenues increased by 45% to $470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers was up 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about the number of customers fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat has been found in cans of beef products sold by two small British retailers at low prices, the Food Hygiene Agency said today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, made in January in Romania and sold by the chains Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained horse DNA in the amount of 1 to 5%.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredient list, it should not have been present in the product," the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes erupted in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles left four people injured early Friday on Route 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4am, a motorist who was driving north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that was arriving in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic returned to normal around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers carrying carry-on baggage on its flights up to $100.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could carry the unopened can with them on the descent of the plane.
The new carry-on fees apply to bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she said.
Airlines began charging for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as much as they could into the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in those compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees will not really be used to collect money.
This is to make it clear to the most loyal Frontier customers that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Frontier boarding gate could carry one bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure passengers are aware of these fees before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s hand luggage fee will not apply until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often scoff at baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are high and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not pay the baggage fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage fee three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline imposing such fees is Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the surcharge.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit’s hand baggage fee was $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate at a time when passengers would discover the airline’s unusual carry-on baggage fees.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding process in my entire professional career,” he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passengers got on board at lightning speed.”
Frontier also does as Spirit and charges $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said passengers who take a soda or juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be reserved for free.
She will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008 but went backwards seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airlines had followed.
Frontier’s decision to charge a carry-on baggage fee when passengers do not purchase their tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced mileage bonuses by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a Frontier trip of 1,000 miles purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown of Denver, but her business backs down and she loses money.
Revenue fell 9% and its flight capacity fell nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to redress Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA blames an “internal error” and not hackers for the failure of its website
The shadowy National Security Agency said Friday it was a bug that caused its public site to crash for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users are still unable to access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once ultra-secret NSA, once dubbed the “No Such Agency,” has come under the spotlight and has been heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications surveillance programs domestically and abroad – which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and leaked by the former NSA bus.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked much speculation that tonight’s incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people were working at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, we met with employees individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” said Félix Bisson, Delta Hotels’ Regional Director of Labour Relations.
The closure of the Delta takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, Transat Tourism Chair holder at UQAM's School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for seniors.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be launched within two years.
Titan CEO: Goodyear Amiens acquisition project starts with zero employees
After throwing the towel with a bang in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site of Amiens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tire maker Titan, declares, today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the factory has.
Arnaud Montebourg, minister of productive recovery, had already announced it, Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plan to buy the plant in January, you are back today.
You had uttered violent attacks and insults, speaking of “so-called workers”, who “work three hours” a day, of “crazy” unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turnaround.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man trying to save some of the highest-paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt anyone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of taxation and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with a fair price and competent workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance pay, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys Goodyear's closed factory.
Titan could then move the machines to Poland or any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
He wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from among Goodyear’s current 1,200 employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before he tries to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all employees.
From then on, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Can you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister was 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance payments.
If all employees accept them, the project to buy the factory starts with zero employees.
How can we provide employment guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we do intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier earnings fall as deliveries and aircraft orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not provide in-flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule before September.
After the test aircraft's maiden flight about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, and the question arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
Results did not live up to expectations and the share price fell 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from "outperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for the stock market to rise over the next quarter or the next two quarters.
“While the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transportation division,” Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We expect Bombardier to register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is modest to date at 177. It appears that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and potential for savings of the new airliner.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders before the commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was advancing on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and plan for an update period, and that's what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
Yet analysts are skeptical that the first customer could fly a CSeries aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it is evaluating the timeline for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slow flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker said it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, up from 83 previously.
The backlog in the Aeronautics division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, said the division’s revenues had increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.

Two speleologists aged 23 and 27 have been missing in a chasm under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, it was learned Friday from the Isère Rescue Speleo.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced in the practice and the other not, had left underground Thursday at about 21:30 to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We haven’t heard from them since, the same source said.
“The speleologists should have left around 5 a.m.,” said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the Rescue Speleo in charge of the rescue organization.
Dozens of people on the spot
Twenty rescue workers, ten civilian members of the French Rescue Cluster, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
In the late afternoon of Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"This is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry, were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They got lost in the network, turned around and waited for rescue, the prefecture said.
Refueled, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists urged to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday urged its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo in the wake of new revelations about the activities of U.S. and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging until further notice,” it said in a statement.
The Washington Post reports that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers are "scandalous".
“The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” said Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
Fires repainted: MP demands the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' project to "relift" traffic light posts in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the center of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 posts of traffic lights of the region in the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to repain all the traffic lights in Brussels, for an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Brussels deputy Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with insanely spending the money of the Brusselsers in operations of relifting the signalling posts in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her operations of flamencoization of the Capital," De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-manga-black taxis, she finally repainted herself in yellow-dark-blue-black the posts of Brussels.
According to the deputy, there is now "no longer a difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than to have their money wasted by a CD&V minister who runs the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"For reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of the Brusselsers!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the Pont - de - Buis Portico
The ecotax portal of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national road was diverted in the aftermath.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax gates in operation in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of the Google smart glasses.
They can thus acquire a headset, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $ 50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of micro-fibers or an in-ear earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with corrective lenses, no large-scale release date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid of forgetting him or rather I didn’t know how I was going to keep “friending” him.
There is no recipe, no manual to cross the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a soft awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that no longer leaves me, laid on the nightstand.
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found her body empty, criss-crossed on that criss-crossed hospital bed.
Similarly, his funeral was a frigid farewell focused around the meager glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, by small apparitions, day or night, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that thought of mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother’s person at all, but simply a woman I did not really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her sojourn in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and now I found her, full and whole.
This detour of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my dad, "inside and out," it seems.
I've always been told that.
I never believed him at the time.
I had a hard relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was afraid, when I had pain...
He talked to me, he constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
In the end, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are gone but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to them: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it’s too late, but there’s always one thing that keeps me from accomplishing that moment.
I often wake up anxious when this happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and fit into my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound, where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was standing out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he smiled at me and rejoiced that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to signify that he joyfully shared what was happening to me.
And of course, there was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I take pleasure in recounting this common memory lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor who I was at the time.
I realized my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and becoming interested in the Middle East, to the point of making a master's degree in a major school, were not, in retrospect, trivial choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are always there, so I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and uprightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes on me.
My mother died 19 years ago now.
She died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that starts on its own, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time eased the pain.
All that remained was the lack, this empty unresponsiveness, this need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me in the depths of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes resting on me, I see the dark circles that weigh his gaze, the fine lines around the lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually relearned to smile, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the middle of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the mood is a little reached.
We feel carried and protected in the difficult times, the retrospect of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay on the path she had drawn us.
If a being has loved you very strongly, the absence cannot rip it from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If my beliefs are sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his view of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think about it.
I don’t know if I adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
Soon it was thirty years ago that my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6.
The immense pain that then overwhelmed me has, of course, eased but he is still close to me.
Very often it "disembarks" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even more sad to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he said "I'm going down" but in such a real voice that I woke up jumping, anxious and I lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We are not telling the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,” al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what’s going on in Iraq isn’t resolved, it’s going to expand, and what’s going on in Syria is going to expand as well.
And what happens when a terrorism virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They held up signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation has been jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years imprisonment by the Liverpool Assize Court.
A top defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after he compromised because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed “Bash” and considered by criminals to be a “major case”, was arrested at his home in 2011 following police wiretapping operations directed towards Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a bar dinner with colleagues.
The investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular user” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period from January to August 2011, he sought unlawful information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were being monitored at the time by police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Along with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, as well as more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared his drug addiction would be exposed.
Today, at the Assize Court in Liverpool, Ditta, who works at Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors, fell into disgrace after being convicted on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer’s downfall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and putting drugs, 60% pure, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the filing, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, a precinct of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drugs, and they phoned each other nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine after tests showed traces of the class A drug in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because he was his client, and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office in his home, as well as in his workplace, and that there were times when clients called him home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he was calling in major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of it.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “If anyone has to know that the law is not to be violated, he is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being overly involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He hindered the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He got too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and said, “If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said, "Mr. Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal himself as soon as he started getting drugs from criminal organizations."
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the backdrops of the leading members of organized criminal groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of all three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in the trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta hosted a Q&A session about himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will return to the stage in December.
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the queen of soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board room of the MotorCity Casino hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, the famous Respect interpreter told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She said she was “happy to be back.”
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered with a coat of light: one could touch the heat stroke in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
An invoice that, unlike many municipalities, is also settled by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of street lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
There was a shooting at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
The suspect is an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident allegedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Police quickly intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport car park.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five vignettes imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, vignettes featuring a high dose of humour, teenagers are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d'art lyrique du Royaume will return with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now fills the room at the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving local artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Apéro lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the colorature soprano Marie-<0xC3><0x88>ve Munger.
It was a benefit activity, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit to produce a financial balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears as a bat air.
Without providing precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions, the future looks good, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"Finance is afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a milestone that we will take in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I would say even beyond," added the general manager, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Surrey's Gabrielle Roy school faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Mustapha Hassan has been charged with hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying a weapon for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
“The swift reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident,” Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New request for class action against the Saint-Croix brothers
A new request for class action has been filed against the Saint-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that this time allegedly took place at St. Joseph's Oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The petition is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Soumis, and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph Oratory, where he was a servant of Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed at only three establishments, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us: "I, I was in such a place, can I register?" says the lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The class action that has just been filed has the peculiarity of allowing the addition of complainants from any institution where abuses could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of the Holy Cross.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Saint-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also underlines that the Congregation of the Holy Cross and the Oratory of St. Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exerted a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse" that they "perpetrated and nevertheless perpetrated".
These latest accusations are based on letters written by the lawyer of the Saint-Croix brothers, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research in the archives on the subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former Saint-Croix brother who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility has been admitted by the Court, the second stage, the hearings on the merits, takes place.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of the Holy Cross had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
A major fire in a business
A fire severely damaged a store in Montreal's LaSalle borough Thursday night.
Rescue was called at about 1 a.m. on Friday after a fire broke out in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took nearly an hour to master the blaze.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the head of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty dwellings on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested because residents of one of the apartments may have to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM said.
Many Opposition to Medical Aid to Die at Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes days after the vote in favor of the principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus were on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Réseau des soins palliatifs du Québec also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Alliance's vice president of palliative care homes, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is disturbing the public about the purpose of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, the Liberal MP of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the notion of the end of life will need to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
“This is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?” the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media court "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we are asking him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have "control over the media", while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a blow" and criticized the bill as "draconian".
The bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall last September.
Kenyan media aroused the anger of the authorities by broadcasting footage of CCTV cameras on which troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly robbed the luxury shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to interrogate them, although the summons was withdrawn following a media shielding.
Under the new bill, the media could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being “deleted” or unable to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize an offender's property if the offender has not paid the fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to cripple most FM stations.”
He also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, wrote, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
Surrendered to themselves, the politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of people’s anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their mirobolant wages to about 532,000 shillings a month tax-exempt – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a stir in the management of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or departures, the pharmacy department has found itself severely understaffed.
It lacked nearly 30% of the necessary staff, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
We did not use troubleshooting, explained Ms. Beaudet.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or reduced to a level as things move forward.
Surely we worked hard to get our young [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
There's a set of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this arduous period, the year 2013-2014 promises to be significantly easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back at work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain have paid off, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to stay at the CSSS.
Now it’s much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our departures from last year.
Always growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always ride on three maternity leave when it’s okay, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old supermodel doesn’t start her film career by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play the young Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama unfolds, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a forty-year-old addicted to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to her eldest is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste for risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on frosted paper will appear in much more sulfurous situations on the big screen.
An excerpt from Nymphomaniac made the temperature rise on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he turned to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses into their final confines, always for the better.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday night
Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Méga CGR of Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tingling in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility evacuated the room and alerted firefighters for a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke against the backdrop of tear gas?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still it is that the direction of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was aired and everything was in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to bring in two kilograms of cocaine hidden in pumpkins Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug was detected.
The cocaine was distributed in three pumpkins that had been emptied beforehand.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, a CBSA spokeswoman.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have made 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, a total of 1,653 seizures of narcotics were made by border officers in the Quebec region.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of SA-8 short-range surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in roughly the same circumstances as on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous US official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont surface-to-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their anger at Washington revealing the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's on Friday downgraded Ukraine's credit rating, casting doubt on the ability of the recessionary former Soviet republic to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt rating has risen to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy will guarantee enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs,” the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This makes it difficult to repay loans taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency considers more and more likely a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of failing to pay a $882 million bill.
The announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government at a time of heated tensions with its Russian neighbour, angered by Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public a day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, with a budget deficit, has been asking for months for help from the International Monetary Fund, which granted it a credit of $ 15.3 billion in 2010 and has so far released only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by raising gas prices to the population.
At the end of an unsuccessful new mission in the country, the IMF this week found that "significant external financing needs" constituted "a vulnerability", while highlighting "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "we can't expect an improvement in the short term."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the expert told AFP.
The only hope is for an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also noted the "uncertainty" over the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditioned on the release of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
“Signing the deal would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia’s reaction,” S&P said, fearing “trade restrictions” from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, warned that in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. green light for Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objection from U.S. authorities to their merger, moving closer to the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the previously announced review period for the merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups said in a statement.
They say they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided by the HSR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining further regulatory authorizations and the approval of shareholders of both groups," they added.
Congolese army hunts down M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would pursue M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of being defeated after being driven out of localities in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that it had controlled since the beginning of the insurgency 20 months ago.
"We will pursue the M23 and corner it wherever it hides because they are criminals," FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganise themselves because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the rebel's political leader, told RFI that the military setbacks would not change his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last insurgent-held locality to fall this week, as well as in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the escape of the government garrison and the passivity of the MONUSCO peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma has led the UN Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was revamped and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” said Jason Stearns, an expert on Congo Siasa affairs.
This would be historic – it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has succeeded in defeating a major insurrection.
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which strongly denies it, of military support for the M23, formed from mutinous former Congolese soldiers.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague has invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military reprisals following shells dropped on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of FARDC soldiers.
“We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable to us to one day be liberated by the army,” said a resident of the border town of Uganda.
"We lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized," the man added.
Tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have proven negative, the health ministry said.
The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date.
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being affected, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Friday that its quarterly earnings were falling due to lower refining margins, as its oil and gas production increased while still lagging behind the group's targets.
Third-quarter net income fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting an average earnings per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd produced a year earlier.
The company is aiming for 2.65 million bpd for this year, with a 25% growth in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment spending has increased by $7 billion over two years and is expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Earnings from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell 45% to $380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a declining net profit on Thursday, despite rising oil and gas production.
Transport of schoolchildren: the complaint considered admissible
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) has been charging a fee of $150 per student since the beginning of the school year (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediate and requested additional time to reflect on it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions," said Lefèvre.
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hôtel-Dieu's emergency room
Faced with the slingshot conducted for several months by a part of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the minister of health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "delay the schedule of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that can not intervene on November 4 ".
A request officially made "to not run any risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but which also aimed at not hindering the PS campaign a few months from the municipal elections.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure is still expected to be effective by that date.
Even if, in the APHP, the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred.
As of November 4, the firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency services at the Hôtel-Dieu will have all received instructions to take 30 serious cases a day to the emergency departments of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, the inmates specialized in emergencies will leave place on Monday to five inmates of general medicine.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency department of the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4," assures Lo<0xC3><0xAF>c Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, which supports the project of the management.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to receive patients in emergencies," he said, citing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on site, he said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide to close the emergency reception service.
"Things are being done gradually," responds Nicolas Peju, spokesman of the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to her," laments the emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Resigned from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the sling against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "warning whistleblower" in the face of a "cynical" decision made by the "médico-administrative technostructure".
"They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he said.
“If other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem.”
They are regularly encumbered.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting in the emergency room of Lariboisière.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" to several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHP are defending the "new hospital model" already in place since October 7, which is expected to continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to participate in the establishment of a "permanence of outpatient care".
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnose," asks Gerald Kierzek for whom "the concept of not serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to be the same as with level 3 maternity wards.
People are not crazy, they will go where there is the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency physician and member of the CGT Santé.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP councillor of Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favor of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, it would mark her net disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama ends IMF and World Bank wiretapping
WASHINGTON (AP) — Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop its wiretapping of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said Thursday.
The decision is part of the White House's attempt to take back control of the NSA wiretaps after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the scandal began.
Asked about the matter, a U.S. administration official responded: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had given orders to stop these practices in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given around the same time as the one ending the wiretaps at the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of this information.
UN welcomes new targets for poverty alleviation
The United Nations will now work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were put in place 12 years ago to combat poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in pushing forward the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “exceed national interests”.
“I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, who was twirling them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment firm.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a t-shirt bearing the words “we want security” in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital’s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, backed initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investments in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and main political force since 1975, and Renamo mutually reject responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo states that the government was behind the recent clashes and that it launched an attack against its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, Renamo’s spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government holds Renamo responsible for triggering the conflicts, and accuses her of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government".
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open university and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes collected by Renamo has been decreasing since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mazanga said Guebuza – who is expected to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what the capacity of Renamo is, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal, is located.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has reinforced the government’s frustrations, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is up to the president to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“Nobody cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
The Legend of Thor might show that "brutal force does not weigh against subtle cunning", while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths are "too violent, too outrageous, and in some cases, too obscene to be taught in school," Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” means that children “completely drop out”, the messages being “sublimated” into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
A Hamas fighter was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza said.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shot by an Israeli armoured vehicle.
NSA spying: U.S. 'goes too far', Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in terms of espionage, admitted Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first admission of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a US government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA’s interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," Kerry said at a conference in London in which he was attending from Washington on Thursday, Oct. 31, via video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of US diplomacy has long justified the practices of intelligence and gathering of information with the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention against possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since foiled many plans of attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
“We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to be aware of these projects upstream,” he said.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived".
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far in an inappropriate way," said the secretary of state, who had already had to speak out on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said Thursday night that President Obama was “resolved to try to clarify and to review these practices so that no one feels deceived.”
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, said the program, dubbed “MUSCULAR,” and led with the NSA’s British counterpart, the GCHQ, allowed the two agencies to retrieve data from fiber optics used by internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on emails, to text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was not aware of such listening, Barack Obama refused to speak on the subject, citing national security.
On the other hand, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services that would seize those communications, before supplying them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and would not be aimed at Europe at all, Gen. Alexander said.
The controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also sparked China’s ire.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its owner, the Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the Ligue 1 club announced in a statement.
PSG, leader of the league in front of Monaco with the difference of goals, has released the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned to selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated deceased
The Père Lachaise crematorium organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased cremated in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate for mayor of Paris must attend, and will then explain at a press conference her proposals on funerals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "erasing of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," responds Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Apprivoiser la mort.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To tame cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, general director of the funeral services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as that to which he would be entitled with an inhumation.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, be it religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For about ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the return of the ashes," observes Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to appoint the deceased, to connect him with others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize the farewell.
This is the case at the crematorium of Père Lachaise, since 1998.
Masters of ceremonies are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Crematorium du Père Lachaise has been organizing, since 2010, on La Toussaint Day, several ceremonies of remembrance, both secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of the people who have been cremated during the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the rehousing because of rats turns to controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Given the urgency of the situation, the director of the office Terres du Sud Habitat, proposed, in an exceptional and provisional way, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, believes Jo<0xC3><0xAB>l Canapa, the director of the office.
There have always been rats in cities.
The deratization company makes two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at each request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not crowd into the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a child.
"We did not invite the rats to our house," defends the father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the penny and we are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Ends Down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The share suffered from the dollar's decline against the yen, which was detrimental to export values, and from the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix dropped 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony fell more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house caught in the flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out Friday at noon in Old Quebec was quickly contained.
More than thirty firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was contained an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw smoke.
"Then the alarms happened, because it took reinforcements to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," said France Loiselle, a Quebec fire department spokeswoman.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up music in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly in front of the public, in the tone of conversation.
Fay’s innovation has continued over the years, to be revived more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theaters.
“Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and enjoyed great success, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year's event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a night of comedy and music for veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, which will be attended by Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians at this year’s festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, presenting for example shows on small TV channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his front-stage appearance in a sitcom on a cable channel (“The League” on FXX’s cheerfully lascivious fantasy football theme) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate appeared on Saturday Night Live and was cast in the "Parks and Recreation" series, but is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, along with other young actors with a singular voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg chatting with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of the comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place at City Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He was telling me that when he was here, sometimes he would go down an alley between two buildings and say, Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here.
Oil price continues to fall and approaches $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that China's electricity-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. benchmark crude for delivery in December fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel late in the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector, which show growth in activity, suggest a rise in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been seen for two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Challenges to the Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal appeals court in Texas reinstated certain restrictions on the right to terminate a pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a law passed in July in that state and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
The ruling by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice abortions will have to have an "admission privilege" with local hospitals.
Admission privilege is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a member of a hospital caregiver, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for the purpose of issuing a diagnosis or treatment.
Proponents of abortion argue that the content of the law could result in the immediate closure of one third of the state's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge ruled on the eve of the law's entry into force that the provisions dealing with admission privilege were unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, has asked the appeals court to overturn the first-instance judgment that blocked law enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star achieved a strong audience return, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV set, or 5.6% of the audience share.
But was the show at the rendezvous?
Some 10,000 candidates auditioned for this 10th season to face the jury: Maurane, the villainous Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored in this first award.
As every year, the first audition shows brewed a wide choice of budding singers, for the better and sometimes for the worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, some have found their way there.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singers are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
The court blocks a decision regarding the NYPD’s control and search policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge’s decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department’s screening and search program and dismissed her from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the city's appeal was finalized.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and remedial orders, including a decision to assign a comptroller to assist the police department in amending its policy and associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments concerning the request for suspension.
The Court of Appeal ruled that the judge should be dismissed from the case because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she reacted publicly to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by mistakenly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
It appointed an external comptroller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in areas with the highest number of controls.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police check.
The hearing of the city's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The control and search tactics have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest level in 2011 with 684,330 checks that concerned mainly black men and Hispanic origin.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a class action.
Supporters advocating changes to the NYPD’s control and search program say they will end unfair practices, build more effective and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police personnel have been sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that she was not ending the control and search practices, which are constitutional, but that she was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants must go to vote, because each of them pay an average of $100 per month on the price of housing that goes in taxes to the City.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase the rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can't afford $100,000 fireworks, $4 to $5 million in case...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Élysée kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the way up to become a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and fed countless greats of this world in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at age 60.
The man with the open face, skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 at Ferté-Saint-Aubin holds a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I went from one castle to another!", ironizes Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the craze of the six presidents for whom he officiated, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysee!
Do not displease heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to terrestrial foods, "they are all greedy", denounced gently Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "he is someone who likes to eat" and "there is not much he does not like".
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific regime request".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at the Elysee: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the Elysée cuisine, who had a drink Tuesday evening with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart.
He said praise.
“His human side came out,” he says.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three alarms from the fire department.
The fire broke out in the front, but rose on all three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokeswoman for the Quebec City Fire Protection Service, said the rapid firefighter intervention helped prevent the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where the buildings are built in close proximity.
The burned house housed four dwellings, but no tenants were on the scene at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin, but the sappers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street Trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some footage of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget about being reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to undress you in his role as an insane trader.
Martin Scorsese tells the true story of a Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a vast corruption case on Wall Street.
In the 80s, Jordan Belfort then sets up a scam that will make him a rich man, very rich.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains the parties, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seem to have regained the magic that united them on Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese has been delayed due to its too long assembly.
The film lasts for 2h45.
In theaters on December 25, he will be able to participate in the Oscars race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a dummy pipe on a liaison involving then-incumbent Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was in a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her “pretty special counsel.”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper had instructed Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and "crash permanently in front of her door", but Coulson also called her and left voicemails.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man who stands in front of people's homes hoping to surprise them, he is the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they say about it," Edis said.
He said NotW used three ways to investigate the subjects: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Is he aware of phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say “Of course it is.”
Rumors about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which hacked voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private investigator's computer that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Ms. Pawlby's every move.
In a voicemail he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I'd really like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defender Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to conducting phone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of a flare-up of violence
The president was due to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released Friday by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN puts the toll even higher with 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.
The violence is increasingly deadly despite increased security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated government of Nuri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence raises fears of a new fire as neighboring Syria is plagued by civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot dead in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complain of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has fueled this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, a day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nuri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the center of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and the elected Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian politics".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uyghur group of Tiananmen attack
China's homeland security chief accused a group of Xinjiang Uyghur separatists of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, slammed into the crowd in China’s famous capital square, a symbol of the deadly crackdown in 1989, and caught fire, killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan of instigating the attack.
Many Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there animated by independence demands.
“The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated,” Meng told Hong Kong’s Phoenix TV.
"The group that was standing behind the scenes was the Islamic movement in East Turkestan," he added, his remarks being picked up by the New China agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uyghur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 injured.
The East Turkestan Islamic Movement is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a large survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asked participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being bound by marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the instruction to get as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to probe parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: army attacks last stronghold of rebels
The irreducible M23, a few hundred fighters, were entrenched at almost 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," said a resident of Jomba, contacted by phone at 12:30, and according to which a girl was wounded by gunshots in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels a little."
According to the witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before climbing to the front for a "crawling operation".
Behind him there was a very clear sound of crackling, nourished by small arms.
De Bunagana, a political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase", as the FARDC "encircled the residual M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army, MONUSCO has not been directly involved in the fighting, but it has provided government troops with critical intelligence, observation and planning support.
In the late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were ascending towards the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikovs and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border crossing with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand-new FARDC truck to replace another M23 rocket bomber in the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday called on the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" or be disarmed "by force", but left open the process of Kampala, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December with no result for the moment.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it remains only to the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the delegation of the M23, without this information can be confirmed immediately from the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the movement back to the DRC that started in the morning reversed at midday.
"This morning we crossed back to our fields, but the military told us to pull back," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back, told AFP.
We have the impression that the shots are getting closer to the populations.
In the early evening, dozens of residents were crossing the border, some with a mattress over their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the singing and dancing productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical is asserting itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart to rock opera, most attempts were tangled in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables bore the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador has changed the game.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hits.
The first one picks up, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other stages, musical performances such as "1789", "Les Amants de la Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are tuned to the tune of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Stories of musical comedies" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the success so hard won.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
There are first the "musical shows" that evolve at the will of the producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true story as in 1789, The Lovers of the Bastille.
Others take a fifteen-year leap backwards on the pretext that you can serve just about anything when you have Matt Pokora at the helm.
Then we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that bring us back to the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon variety musicals by adapting them into French.
Independent French producers are attempting a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Spider Woman's Kiss" or "Spring Awakening" are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough artists capable as on Broadway of singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musical comedy, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these trades in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The pool of talent is as significant as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few plays tour and it is often boulevard theater intended for adults and not young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
It is these same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show, is the assurance of an enthusiasm of these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are expertly maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial zenith.
The mayonnaise was grown in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the great halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a phantom driver in the ring of Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning at around 5:30 a.m. in the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who was unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the accident site, as long as the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause any traffic jams because the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured in a Disneyland Paris attraction
A five-year-old boy has been seriously injured in an accident at a Disneyland Paris attraction.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" attraction.
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: the army is preparing a new assault
Children play on a charred armoured vehicle that belonged to the M23 rebels, in Kibumba, on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault on the last bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on her own.
There will only be Runyonyi Hill left.
"The one in Chanzu is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
A political fief and last stronghold of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was retaken Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Since then, a few hundred of the M23's irreducibles have been entrenched at almost 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting Thursday throughout the day said the situation had been "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the day before and were buried.
One girl was wounded by gunshot wounds and three others were injured, including one seriously evacuated by the FARDC, the witness said.
Since the resumption of fighting between the FARDC and the rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not reported any casualties.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of the U.S. intelligence services, insisted again in September that the U.S. is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, began uncovering his inexhaustible treasure trove of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked corporate paranoia over state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop that overflowed the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data should be used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the United States poses as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all of Snowden’s documents, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on business secrets from foreign companies to U.S. companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“This is not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations has been a shock to some companies that previously thought China posed the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A big change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-U.S. members gave up their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. data mining program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, Managing Director of chemicals company BASF.
Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case it leaves an advantage to an opponent.
Big companies have long hammered out the message that it’s at least reckless to retrieve a free USB stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says that collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so they can’t be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad due to the risk of smartphone integrity being compromised.
Prepaid cell phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warned in a report.
The United States warns its own companies about economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty in the second degree of having carried out acts of hacking economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A board member of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia teenager, who died under unusual circumstances, believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgian teenager, whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled up in his high school gymnasium, believe their son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on Jan. 11 stuck in a rug leaning upright behind the steps of his high school gymnasium.
Lowndes County Sheriff’s Investigators concluded that Johnson died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes those findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as stated in the sheriff's findings.
“They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump said.
They are convinced that these findings were made for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a purse and returned it to them in a mortuary bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several important questions remain unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated Johnson had died of “positional asphyxiation.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to hand over all video surveillance footage that investigators had examined.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video footage would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC releases advice on child allergies for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines outlining how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize faculty and staff to food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
He also recommends schools have a stockpile of epinephrine – the branded EpiPen auto-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “I feel like something is tingling my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I have tingling on my tongue.”
NSA case underscores total lack of intelligence debate
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand offends itself in public by summoning the ambassador of the United States on October 21, and on the other prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of US surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listening of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn’t there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the veil on the analysis by US diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we indeed consider that, in the eyes of American power, this constitutes an important illumination.
When we describe the American systems of interception against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to be outraged by this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
For the last ten years, the implementation of very powerful technological tools of interception by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have put in place almost daily cooperation and information exchange procedures, which are described on both sides as essential.
As an example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - it has already been quickly said - the Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the substantive issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to equip themselves with tools of interception, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of infringements of freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States deteriorating its image?
Although they are denounced, I do not see how they can be punished.
The risk to Americans can be doubled.
The first is when their allies – and this has been the case recently – learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest level of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US providers subject to US laws, and therefore to the grip of the NSA.
Last but not least, the widespread movement of revelations by media outlets around the world, which is helping to spark a debate about intelligence surveillance practices that had been virtually non-existent, could prompt lawmakers, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose “indeterminate sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly attributed to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to enter an "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sex reassignment surgery for their infant, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and baffled.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, with intersexuality in the group of about sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering surgery, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York who specializes in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “seems like a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but that is not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery surrounding homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as being either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, (such as muscle mass, hair, breast and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sex organs), or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-conforming gender now have special camps for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her appeal trial that allows her to keep an “unspecified” sex for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the interior ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators in this largely Catholic country signed a petition to have “gender theory” removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not, we overthrow two other pillars of civilization."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also told Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be assigned to babies at birth.
“The parenting role is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community viewed gender as a slate that can be erased and re-drawn.
But now, many are questioning the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when he grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we did not call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental cues – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a sloppy circumcision to have him castrate entirely, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that wasn’t the case,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “always repeat this pattern.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say “[that] they are not satisfied with the outcome.”
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So soon after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sex organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, undergoing testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he stands up for the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, CEO of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labeling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make swift decisions and gives their child an ‘indeterminate’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only put forward hypotheses.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be recognized as a third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,” she added.
German law deals with the attribution of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should wage at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said German law will “enable” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law gives parents some latitude so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to take certain tests and understand them, and a time frame before registering "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and that’s a great thing.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta says his government will last until 2015 despite strong left-right tensions in the ruling coalition as the Senate votes to oust Silvio Berlusconi.
In an interview with La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he had "firmly the intention" to continue governing with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former president of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support to the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, pronounces its impeachment.
But part of his camp, grouped around the national secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2nd by his refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of shots.
Firefighters called at the scene said they had responded to a call for “multiple injuries.”
"Police forces are on site," the airport said on its Twitter account, as television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local broadcaster showed a person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second being transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that the 2nd and 3rd terminals are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was not immediately able to confirm whether one of his employees was injured.
All flights arriving and departing from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli tank fire killed an Islamist Palestinian Hamas militant on Thursday and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, health officials said.
A Hamas source said fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli military simply referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel described as "terrorist" by the Jewish state, dug on the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama’s campaign seen as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have considered, in the utmost secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the highlight of the highly anticipated 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and said Thursday night that the president’s close associates had conducted “in-depth group work and polls at the end of 2011” to see if Biden’s ouster could help Obama with his re-election as his hopes waned.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, to gauge what effect the replacement of the vice president by former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the Chicago Campaign HQ and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties," before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember at that time, the president wasn't fit, and so we were like, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the review "coordinated," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to find out whether the change would benefit the poll.
“Campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known if Obama was aware that his team was reviewing the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the eventual reshuffle.
Although Daley said he did not think the president “was aware” of the possible change, the former secretary-general admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived on Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know Biden’s eviction from the presidential list was being examined.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluorescent ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice cream.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He came up with the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the shiny protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, said: "It's something incredible but we're still in the early stages of production, and 2g of this stuff costs about <0xC2><0xA3>200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice starts to shine.
We tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary shiny effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever made because jellyfish luminescence is worth four times more than gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But she tastes pretty good!
The experiment-driven company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation promises to be even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice.”
This is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed Died During Tai Chi Session
The singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and aimed at the residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died on Sunday at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning as he was looking at the trees and performing the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his musician’s hands slitting the air,” Anderson wrote.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she promised her husband, the week before his death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual home.
“Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of life he had,” she said.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more sluggish.
In the last two years, I haven’t given out a single candy and I certainly won’t this year.
But the stats show that I'm the weasel's sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party are the trends.
Costumes are expected to represent $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects make fury.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet Daft Punk space men will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That makes a lot of curious dogs disguised as hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don't bum.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go candy hunting in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, let’s not tell each other stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat; yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That’s about 9 billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They carry the best names, such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which is actually a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted homes in the U.S., which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes these great photos of you pissing on yourself that your friends put on Facebook and you can't take away, and which a guy you like leaves a "good head" comment.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a lantern-shaped pumpkin is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “kidnapper trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pumpkins and didn’t have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lanterns that gently wilt on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922kg pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an in-house bad bank of <0xC2><0xA3>38bn (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45bn) of the most risky assets, a move aimed at relaxing its relationship with London and accelerating its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it within three years.
RBS also said it would write an additional depreciation provision for suspicious receivables of <0xC2><0xA3>4 to <0xC2><0xA3>4.5 billion for the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also said that this internal restructuring would release <0xC2><0xA3>10 to <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion of capital, thus strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would allow to draw a line on the past, the government in particular having been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for the customer and for the UK,” McEwan said.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally fans who join Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are very pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are confident that this will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rally raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is really going to be exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after he was stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a non-serious road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry
Firefighters descended in rappel along the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from certain death
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called to retrieve it safely while it was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a quarry Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, traveled to Flappit's Denholme, West Yorkshire quarry to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and made a call on social media sites after she disappeared into the career following a non-serious accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-sighted person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a ledge in the quarry, trapped 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and sank to rescue Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate some biscuits afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that anyone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to get away with it unscathed.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check-up; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified to watch the rescue.”
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was amazing to have him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were awesome.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each one of them was absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall, but she didn’t move.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He drew me when I was 18."
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he “categorically denies making any advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, “Prism,” landed at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question Turkmen Islamic movement
"Behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," the head of China's security agencies told a Hong Kong television station, according to a video posted late Thursday on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization since Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uyghurs from the same family in the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, threw their car loaded with gasoline canisters against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among al-Qaeda-affiliated organizations.
This movement is often referred to by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing history of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement area in order to be able to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and this was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU member states spend much of their time bypassing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continued non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
This is a story that is not one of them.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I first heard the nonsense that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
Yet we forgot an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe’s instructions, in fact?
Why trade the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely deadlocked.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties opposing the EU or advocating the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and coming from nowhere, garnered nearly five million votes in the September federal elections and pulled the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the burden on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that record excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has imposed favourable exchange rates on its members for German exporters – something that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper unease about productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a redhibitory disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt rumbles, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, sending the Socialists back to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split from the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with her new popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single anti-currency and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is quite possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the unique anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more like the free “Europe of Nations” privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will turn a sweet eye to the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of Little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European agreement on the condition that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
Scotland’s SNP government is – and should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a dramatic majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: ageing earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s breasts and pubic hairs start growing at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, it doesn’t indicate a rapid move toward full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as breast budding, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of first periods over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years, compared to 12 3<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 years in 1970.
“Once the breast has started to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first periods appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered “early” when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can closely follow.
A faster evolution may justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medications but acknowledges that “controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have their periods.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories made public about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate, to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have younger facial and pubic hair, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be cautious about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls with early puberty should be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
A Tribute to the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Failing to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have set their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac proves to be an accomplished musician and folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich outfits of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swear debited at the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week the tribulations of a folk singer who fails to break through and gets angry with the whole earth.
He accepts backwards replacements at the raised foot in the studios.
Without housing, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not here at the right time, who is not careerist but integrity, with self-destructive behavior," Coen, crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and awards at Cannes, told reporters.
While Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time such as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk writes.
The film then takes on a documentary look, from the dusty, unsold 33T-invaded music label inhabited by an unpayable old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character that runs through the film constantly: a gorgeous red-haired cat with a crackling look, Llewyn Davis’s companion of fortune.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled growing up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country.
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play the guitar,” he said.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to "be considered good", "chance can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get stuck by anything that can stop us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", has died.
He never knew the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, The New York Times named him as “the spy novelist who knew too much.”
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theater of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically impaired by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also gone to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, assured to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS à Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Without a doubt between 120 and 150 million all countries combined," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Foch Avenue, close to the Arc de Triomphe, with a mischievous eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages into which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting pirate editions," he added, designating a stack of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivories brought back from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, his Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a dissident Austrian aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, hunts down all the villains of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s onwards.
In every book, the same recipe: a great deal of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
“I never claimed to be a literary author,” said Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, of the type Albert London, who went there and came back with real and long investigations".
The father of SAS said "do a kind of geopolitical soap opera".
"I constantly follow my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," Gérard de Villiers added.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, people from the services that I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitory: thus, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Damascus Way".
In "The Mad Ones of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the birthplace of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat in "The Cairo Plot", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4x4 jihadists who were based in the Malian capital.
I am not a fortune teller, Gerard de Villiers defended himself, I simply make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM daisy typewriter "whose parts have all been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "END" and corrected each page with a pen.
On the walls of his office are hung AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age".
He will not die and will not retire.
No more than I do.
Airplane builders quarrel over seat width while big orders are at stake
Dispute rages among major aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at this month’s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute is over the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but to whom the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economy classes, but its major U.S. rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as aircraft manufacturers sought to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record number of orders at the Nov. 17-21 event.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, whether there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is critical to the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its refurbished 777X will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide in economy class, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aerospace giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take the lead over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were recently able to see what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept this?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Chief Commercial Officer of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people get bigger, but seats in planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing’s jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average 21st-century American’s waist circumference is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival clings to a siege concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the aircraft newly dubbed "jet set" was narrower.
Airbus added that it has commissioned a study that indicates that an additional inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ figures on seat width and says it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says the study shows that cabin experience does not just depend on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to run their business,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s head of passenger satisfaction.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their company better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is an estimated $700 billion worth of aircraft orders at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seat configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim 20 percent higher per-seat performance in their latest long-haul twin-engine models than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in unit costs is small compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to accommodate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Director of Passenger Comfort at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777s suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is driven by the 777 threat,” said Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft salesmen who travel around the world even take a meter with them to check competing configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider aisle-side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that its appeal to the aviation industry to put in place a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could make the 777X sales wave forget.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just hailed from the victory of his boat at the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison received a negative vote on his salary.
The Oracle boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group’s poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but it received about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only one symbolic dollar.
Over the full offset period of 2013, Oracle's net income rose 3.5% while the stock market price jumped 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index, which rose 24% at the same time.
New nicotine vaccine could suppress the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further testing is needed before starting human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his or her dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice that hadn’t been vaccinated “were soothed,” the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently that the antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and inconvenient.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it turns liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but noted that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, security services said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the military and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in the strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike," a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, informed the British government that talks had begun with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a café, after they expired in August 2005, without a call for tenders.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid’s secret interest in these properties, following testimony by Mr. Tripodi’s former deputy secretary general, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government lobbied for leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, leases for the Circular Quay companies, which paid Obeids about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without a tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, Tripodi acknowledged, called for a change in government lease policy.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ports Department after working under Mr. Obeid at the Fisheries Department.
"Was the development of the commercial lease policy the subject of these telephone conversations?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we talked about, but it wasn't that.
In any case, certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has conducted airstrikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass an "authenticity" test
The government is currently studying the possibility of putting in place an “authenticity” test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion intended to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a diversionary means to bring family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
“The resounding statements about ‘foreigners coming back to the end of the queue’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return to a time when unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labor had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historic artifact.
The working paper outlines the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be screened for "whether the job offer is genuine in the event that the applicant is a relationship or a personal associate of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring business."
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man’s 9-year-old son was traveling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father’s death Wednesday from an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the UK Government.
The work by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would “bring together the UK”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government upped the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7bn to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6bn.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study strengthening rail capacity and improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of trip times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we face a capacity problem in our rail network.
But it is also about expanding the connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to support "unequivocally" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to deliver considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight into the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the UK ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps."
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing despite the move by the United States to relax electronics regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases as long as they are in “airplane” mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it painful to not be able to access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
The Australian carriers are reviewing the decision requiring U.S. carriers to do significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in airplanes,” she said.
The issue is subject to regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety guidelines given by crew members.
Virgin, which has previously spoken to CASA about its intention to expand the use of its onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change but said it would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it is complying with the current rules for the time being.
“According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no immediate intention to change that,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In the rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will ask passengers to switch off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in violent brawl
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three vehicles of the gendarmerie, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a brawl involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four minor injuries should be reported.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the site to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore pawnshops profit from middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawnshop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga drops off a gold bracelet, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters’ tuition fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is so strong in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it carried out its transaction, became this week the third pawnshop to be listed on the Singapore stock exchange.
Pledging jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in Mrs. Amirthalinga’s case – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Singaporean pawnbrokers generally charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requesting a credit check or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers as families feel the pressure of rising costs of living and over-indebted households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by overly lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers to bridge the gap as their economies slow.
This week, ratings agency Standard & Poor's cited rising household debt, mainly stemming from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' solvency.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt-to-GDP ratio in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which recently emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the pay scale] are looking to supplement their income as much as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have prompted people to hasten to pledge their personal belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pledged in the city-state’s 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pledge grandma's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
ValueMax, the operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 other stores such as this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its managing director.
The company will fund them using 60% of the $66 million it raised this week when it was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticized for their exorbitant interest rates, Ms. Yeah notes that pledging not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers mortgage assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
Pledge is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed short-term financing.
People who go to pawnshops are also not just those who have financial problems.
The affluent people of Singapore also go to ValueMax pawn shops to pawn gold bullion or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“It can be affluent people who need to borrow in the short term for business activities or investments, or small businesses who have cash needs to make a difficult journey,” adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor Accused of Child Pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches of his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Timberlay Baptist Church, where the pastor was serving, said it was deeply saddened by the news.
In a statement, church officials said Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He went to the supermarket in Nazi uniform before being chased out.
A man wearing a Nazi uniform striped with a swastika armband was asked to leave an English supermarket as customers complained to the management of the establishment that called police, the store said on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," a spokeswoman for supermarket chain Asda said.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "by the time she arrived, he had already left without a flash," she added.
I was standing in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
The people were speechless.
“You don’t go out on the street like that unless you want to get attention,” Rosina Rusin, 60, told Cambridge News.
The incident occurred on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
“I have been wearing an SS black armband twice a week for three years at Asda,” said Paul Dutton, who said he was suffering from “mental problems.”
$325 million rescue plan for Tasmania’s health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the wobbly health care system has strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent action” to end a crisis caused by the island state’s aging population, high rates of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmania’s independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and cataract surgery, will help catch up.
Funding is also provided for non-scheduled clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved outpatient care, training for medical professionals, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to care for Tasmania’s health system,” said Plibersek.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million won’t count for much “unless it’s followed by real reform to consolidate Tasmania’s public health system.”
However, he congratulated the government for responding to its request for urgent assistance to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope the federal aid plan will go a long way in removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "fortuitous solution."
“The reason we’re here is that the state’s Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system,” he said on ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that pulls out nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts in $300 million, and pretend it's a good day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous reconstruction of the period, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that is the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria Has Destroyed Its Chemical Weapons Production Capacity, Monitoring Agency Says
Syria has destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day ahead of the deadline for the
The Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or "unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The militant group, which tracks the human balance through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, of which 18,678 were pro-government forces fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country due to the conflict.
Assad's troops have been fighting rebels, many of whom have been linked to al-Qaeda groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war, within tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was “now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and mixing and filling machines.”
She added that "no further inspection activities were planned at this time."
Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites Damascus reported.
They were not able to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I commend the moral strength and courage that you have all shown as part of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are backed by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger over sentence against one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted with anger to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was convicted of mass killings in the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He has also been convicted of numerous other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for life imprisonment, yet they could have asked that the man, described as a "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in making bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision has revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“He should be dragged before the firing squad,” Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he “died” three times while on breathing assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have experienced the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali’s bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces will kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an effort to restore ties between the Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t surrender,” Corteen added.
Until recently, he laughed out loud at the grief he might have caused others.
The verdict came on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Corteen said.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from door to door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phones – under the much-anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
The airlines will need to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules to be compliant.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we may approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to re-ignite them until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives the green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the aircraft descends prior to landing and not re-ignite them until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during takeoffs, landings and rolling on the ground, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with the changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will benefit everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room guards” when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and texts or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-style game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was loudly ejected from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Cell phones on board will also continue to be banned.
Regulatory power over mobile phones is vested in the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered to pose a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allow broader use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D.Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply as device usage has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget at the time.
New airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when you turn a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s executives loaded an airliner of Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This inspired mixed feelings among FAA advisory committee members as to whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots indicating that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to switch off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense arrangements for tech-equipped travelers.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not inconsistent with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A bird helicoptered from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, helicoptered after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water rake was flown aboard a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before it was rebuilt by the Scottish SPCA at its Alloa rescue centre.
The center’s director, Colin Seddon, said: “This water rattle was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of strong winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find shelter on the oil rig.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted for help.”
The water rattle was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what wealth and job creators want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in the UK.
The findings of the investigation will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get stuck in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe’s institutional arcana.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competencies should go back to Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue its efforts to change the treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This finding, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the corporate world is pushing for a “significant change” that restores power to the UK.
The stakes are high – being able to change the treaty and better represent Britain’s interests would see a 16% tipping of votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The prime minister should not doubt for a moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies are hoping that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British businesses, as the euro area is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as our survey findings show, for businesses this means re-emphasising trade and a fundamental change to the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in Halloween Colors
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the tradition of Halloween.
With his wife last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of guests in the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween celebrations on the east coast of the United States were cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the partygoers caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people took part in the parade organized in the neighborhood of "Greenwich village".
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We have fun like crazy, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
It's a good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints' Day, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller says Bulgarian gas pipeline ushers in new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the director of Gazprom said.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," Gazprom chief executive Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, the country through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe transits, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the director.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is commissioned in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline has been designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking an information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if we count three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English navy that resulted in three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend 95% on London's generosity.
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuarize these 836,000 km2, provided however that it has the means to ensure its surveillance, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance vessels.

Life imprisonment for former Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of northeastern China’s Jilin province was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of receiving more than 19 million yuan in bribes, official Chinese media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the chairman of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing's first intermediate court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, saying the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be just as unassailable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, among them former cadres of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions within the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, a party-independent body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA have been charged with sexual assaults against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it had “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Chief Executive Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assaults on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was inaccurate, noting that “external YMCA controls were conducted and indicated that child safety was a top priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings out of four institutions in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's deficiencies in child safety.
Staff testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including Lord being alone with the children, keeping them private, making them sit on his lap, telling them that he loved them and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said she found Caringbah YMCA Children's Services Manager Jacqui Barnat, who supervised Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Chief Executive Officer said that he dismissed the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these breaches to their supervisor.
Instead, he stated that their friendly relationship with Lord blurred their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare said he had expressed his view to the New South Wales YMCA board that, for the organization, the lesson learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not be about "reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were raised was made by YMCA Chief Child Services Officer Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid contamination of the evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed at the YMCA, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruitment, monitoring, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledged that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old voiced his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the helm, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister, Blair reportedly replied, according to the London Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it may be likely that this will happen, so...”
When many equestrian event experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But nobody expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old, win.
Not yet in school and just a few months after making their first weapons, the toddler and his Shetland Toffee pony trotted through the three laps with great ease and won the top prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – who are the same size – were commended for their presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing up against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side in a casual way to run his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was commended by the judges for his natural training qualities uncommon for a child his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great duo.”
They showed up for and against everyone, but both took the gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were so excited that he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale in southern Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been competing in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, “There was electricity in the air and everyone was cheering and applauding it.”
He ran the entire length of the track and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens that he takes care of.
The way he started, he’ll surely be attending the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he’ll do a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian rally said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They make a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee performed well and how they paraded on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he looked really good.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call “will be reworked”
A Chinese newspaper that has issued a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be revamped, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The order for "redesign" was issued by the Guangdon Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by Yangcheng Evening News, published several erroneous articles about the Zoomlion-listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“New Express’s editorial staff was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete reshuffle of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately reshuffle the newspaper’s management team.”
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express about alleged financial irregularities at a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television station where he admitted to publishing fake stories for money.
"In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and their ability to gain public trust," he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen’s apology, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is down.
The leak of radioactive steam detected on one of the two nuclear boilers of the Charles-de-Gaulle, in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was "safe for sailors", but is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal Navy has just confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a specialist in naval defense, assures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
This involves, among other things, changing a pump on the failing boiler room.
"Everything is being done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," DCNS explains, however.
And the national Navy certifies that "it does not in any way call into question the program of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle is emerging from an interim maintenance period of six months.
He had sailed from Toulon in mid-October for a training.
This, in particular, with a view to qualifying young fighter pilots.
A "small breakdown", confined to the reactor containment area, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the Navy, the crew had not been exposed to radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to observe a great dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, flood of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs never ending.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of squandered dollars could be saved in order to allow very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken from taxpayers by force diminishes their freedom to consume and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with sumptuous spending and the maintenance of lame ducks: deficit cultural center, high subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also saddening to note the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
I do, however, make an honourable mention of the transformation of the former Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such enterprises, but in the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to hear that the Fisheries and Pile Lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the great decline in the population, water use has decreased significantly throughout the territory.
Not to mention wasting it, the city will never run out of water and the strict regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been running ties with pretty degrees for more than 40 years, and I don't think a sheep farmer can do any worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rails, has been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4-foot by 3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passageways they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging over a length equivalent to nearly six football fields in length, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to conceal drug trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs escaped unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men, who authorities said were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison term ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers exploit vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major crossing discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard railroad passageway that ran from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two warehouses in San Diego.
British Police Issue Extradition Warrant Against Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a “notice of surrender” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would likely be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sex crime, after exhausting all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station, on the date and time of his choice,” a spokesperson said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after unveiling more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
No more passwords to type in to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will make it possible to ascertain the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 alone and in France, the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, hand shape or venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques that will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most commonly used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
“For example, some people who work with concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible,” says Philippe Robin, technical director of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand suppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a drawback: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for about twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of the sensors and the computational capacity of the computers necessary for the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D labs in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
Unique and unfalsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and prospective at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers forensic police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who they claim to be).
Until now, identification concerned the issuance of identity papers: the biometric elements (fingerprints, photo, iris) must be compared with the information that the State has on all citizens already filed.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to impersonate someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
“We retrieve the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities who circulate freely on the Internet,” explains Dany Nassif, in charge of commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Another use: take a photo of a quidam that is queuing in a store, track its progress thanks to facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, attendance control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend pointing to another," explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also affect transactions, in particular those carried out from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some vending machines by introducing your card and laying your hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the typing of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in stores with his credit card, the customer does not type his code, but enters his finger in a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is expected to last six months.
If conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tips to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the box thirty seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large supermarket.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you customized options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
“The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure enclosure, which crashes if we try to move it,” says Philippe Robin, from Thales.
But, for lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Privacy specialists, on the other hand, continue to be concerned.
“Advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras, and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr, or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick of the Canadian Privacy Commissioner.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was inflicted a <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 almond
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be carried between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points removed on his license led to a 6-month license withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a victim surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
A tax on foreign property owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally assessed the capital gains tax measure but awaits a final decision by Mr. Osborne who, in Budget 2012, included a 7% stamp duty for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties as part of a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and amounts to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, exceeding the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: "Following the increase in the stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on high-value properties, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are undertaxed regardless of the effects of the outdated housing tax system."
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestige real estate – the top 5 to 10 percent of the real estate market – in the thriving South West London sector stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
Prices in central London show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "domestic market", with the city's southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just shed light on how a dog’s tail movements are related to his mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs moved their tails more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that, in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to see what was going on in other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the leftward movement and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the animals’ heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
It will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with movies featuring other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor – and we were able to tamper with the tail movement and present it as going more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw an expressionless dog moving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail deviating mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog waving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks dogs know from experience what movements they should or shouldn’t worry about.
He added: “If you repeatedly encounter other dogs and notice that most of the time the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
The researchers say the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, “Dogs would go more easily to a robotic dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.”
He said the differences could come from the fact that the dogs participating in the different studies did not fully consider film animals or robotic dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was due to perform Friday at The Hydro concert hall in downtown.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys are also due to postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on November 21st.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis appoints his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking men of church in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so it falls to a group of 120 “cardinal electors”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would be held ahead of the ceremony during which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will likely have declined.
He said a pope would generally appoint as many cardinals as it took for the number of cardinal electors to reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year’s consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favor Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope decided on his own.
"From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He added that it was “completely possible” for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we’ve never experienced such a situation – it’s totally new.
Valero said the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the US to repair the seat back
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to fix a problem with manually tilting backrests, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit from the rear, the head restraint may not protect passengers properly, increasing the risk of injury," the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a statement.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The rollout of GM’s pickups began in June and marks the largest vehicle launch for the top U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM notified pickup owners of the defect during the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the owners' newsletter due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
The price of GM shares rose 1.4 percent to reach $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred around 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been going on there for some time.
A foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the construction site to retrieve his tools.
I was passing by and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We could only see a part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.

It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the gloom of the second year of medicine and give me hope again.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and is the memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patients' medical records at night and go to bed, this book takes me back to the days when politicians inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and news anchors took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades wept for joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama’s transition period before he took office in 2008, he had 82% favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it is like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember those days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years after I first voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our military, to the end of “neither seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the verge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks on innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data about Americans’ privacy, nor the prosecution of whistleblowers who reveal the government’s misdeeds.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the exceeding of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all of the examples I listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had heard about for so long.
Yet, while the favorable opinion index plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania Primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to focus on our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I don't agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on rue de Retinne in Fleron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fleron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of that system.
The mining tycoon, who is challenging the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has argued this argument in an attempt to rule out questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the election commission officially declared that Palmer won the Sunshine Coast siege of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of a redesign of the voting system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why couldn’t we have a system where you could enter, enter your details into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone does not agree?
Nowadays, having a pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered possible options for electronic voting and recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific mission manager at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM), returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
This is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
While in the past species were described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of the classification of species.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are questioned due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two species very close morphologically have been distinguished thanks to genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is this a significant discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society has stated?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only at this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered depending on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility of recovery from nearby stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the newly discovered species has emerged, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene mixing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well known.
One would rather send robots to Mars than find out what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research and it is high time that this changed.
RBS Suspends Two Foreign Exchange Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources familiar with the matter, showing once again that the global regulators’ investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the widening investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources familiar with the matter said RBS had forwarded files of emails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European head of spot trading for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi’s European head of spot foreign exchange trading, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS said this week it filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made about bankers who have agreed to manipulate exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources familiar with the matter said.
Banks have been peeking through instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News of these surveys have shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been called into question this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast, highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at a low cost.”
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working in its London Stock Exchange funds office this week after he caused a $6 million loss late last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was brought under control," a Credit Suisse representative said.
Investigation into Mayor Rob Ford was sloppy, lawyer says
After police confirmed they had obtained a copy of the video that showed Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby said she had never seen an investigation "so sloppy".
Ruby told The Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or downplayed" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's 35-year-old friend and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, and charged him with extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Ruby called it “inexplicable” that police never searched Rob Ford’s car or his home, or tapped his phone, arguing that police chief Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an immediate search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but spokesperson Mark Pugash called Ruby's remarks an "obvious and desperate attempt" to make himself heard by the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a news conference Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stocks down at mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are down on Friday at mid-session, led by some disappointing news from companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
Investors remain cautious as they believe the US Federal Reserve could unwind its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures suggest that U.S. stocks are opening up after two straight sessions of downturns.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest fall of the CAC 40, leaded by the warning on results of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) posted the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also publishing lower results this morning and announcing the internal creation of a "bad bank" comprising 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the top of the rises in the EuroFirst300 in reaction to a press report that AT&T is studying a possible takeover bid.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation about the evolution of the monetary policy of the ECB is going strong, as evidenced by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB’s single mandate has always been about inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the euro to fall.
Against this backdrop, the euro continued to fall against the US currency and hit a two-week low in the session at $1.3517.
These same conjectures support the euro area bond market in reverse.
Supreme Court approves Obama's health care reform bill
Big win for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared Obama’s health care reform law constitutional.
By five votes to four, the judges upheld the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, or else pay a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government’s taxation power.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page Act and further considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the Medicaid eligibility threshold should be lowered or all federal funding for the program will be lost, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The process to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election, including the nominee Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as numerous patriotic associations, paid tribute on Friday afternoon to the soldiers and the deceased of all wars.
Garbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by the deputy mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israeli-Palestinian clash at Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded Thursday evening in a violent clash at the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased operation on Friday after its fuel stocks ran out, the Palestinian enclave's Energy Authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas branch officer, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell fire during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Yunes, in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made a 100-metre incursion into the territory before retreating.
The clash lasted about half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupier in Khan Yunes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
The Israeli army said the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, saying the goal was to abduct Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting IDF forces and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel struck an air military base in northwestern Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah, reported Thursday the satellite channel Al-Arabiya.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but gave no details on the target.
“In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah,” he added.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it did not name, the Saudi-owned chain said that "the bombing targeted a cargo of surface-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, had reported several explosions heard Wednesday at dawn at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization relying on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, advances, in profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes its form.
And this shape will be that of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, entirely dressed in black, only hands and face uncovered, wait on each side of the playground, rush when the next spelling appears, embody it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done in solo relays, in a group in unison (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
One thinks of "Glory of the Morning", where, as a soloist, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed online in the foreground.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux’ poem, monocord and monotonous in the auction, and will continue dancing.
And the music to start again, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - creating images has always been a force at Chouinard - such as those smudging hair or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, has imposed herself, with her tics.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’s inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a wider and gibbous imaginary than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches magic.
The public liked it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after intermission, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a neglected house.
At the piano, dancers take turns playing the scores.
Their awkwardness in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small solos of transitions, sets that move, choirs, writing is less binary.
Jesters appear, also familiar to Chouinard, sporting the red nose, in highly polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnage, runaways or gamblers.
The gestures, the laughter and the small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the bodies in coitus, of the beings that merge.
But the room takes its real flight after the salvation.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the cabotine dancers descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness perspire, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei face lawsuits over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it headquartered at the auction of the patents that took place after Nortel went bankrupt.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Court of Assize in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow ads to be displayed in connection with Internet search terms, the court’s findings said, which is Google’s core business.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which offers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel’s patents to Rockstar, Google later acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola’s patent library.
“Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auction, it has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is claiming higher damages against Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother allegedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which left two seriously injured Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a faulty water heater, said Friday evening the deputy prosecutor of the King.
The expert dispatched to the scene by the prosecution ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a build-up of gas.
The prognosis for both victims is still in place.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his partner, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and conditioned on the spot before being taken to the Liège Hospital, she by helicopter, he by ambulance," Mayor José Paulet said.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase that remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
Firefighters from Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
The Civil Protection of Crisnée stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to take oath
Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he took the oath of office, becoming the first freely elected president to succeed Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the Constitutional High Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the 18 black-robed judges of the court whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States by the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group seen for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to cheer on the new president and, detaching from the splendor of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Regarded as the Muslim Brotherhood’s uncharismatic “relief wheel,” his personal prestige has greatly strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mohamed Morsi, wearing a blue suit and red tie, said in an oath to judges in the woodworked room where he was sworn in.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by a military band that played the national anthem as he stood guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." sung by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year began, and vowed to take back the presidential powers from which the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to formally swear an oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The US shutdown has slowed the growth of the car market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal governments weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, according to figures released Friday by automakers, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
Detroit’s three major automakers are showing double-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market stood at 15.3 million, according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he said the slight brake was primarily due to “the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month.”
GM, however, reported a nearly 16% increase in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, up from 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group’s four brands saw their business performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pickups, saw its sales increase by 14 percent year-on-year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was expected to 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% in its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted lower-than-consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM was up 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford was down 1.1%.
Renault on the Stock Exchange due to Nissan's warning
Renault is accusing the biggest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris on Friday after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had cut its forecast of annual net profit by almost 20 percent, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle in its management.
Several traders reported that Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
“This is clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” said a senior trading official at a Paris broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from the Nissan website.
Greece: Two killed in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by gunfire from two people on a motorcycle passing a neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in the western suburbs of Athens, a police source said.
Police were not yet able to provide information on the identities of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Anti-terrorism officers rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place, and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Dawn MPs, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's Appeal Rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well-suspended for his club’s next two Champions League matches, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsed against Barça for sending a blow to Neymar, the Scottish midfielder has seen his suspension extended to three matches by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed" that his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes across the province were without power shortly after noon on Friday as strong winds hit many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers plunged into darkness, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The greater Montreal area is also experiencing its share of outages with nearly 7,000 homes without power in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and expects record results from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit for the entire year between $325 and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12-17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had achieved 8% profit in the first half and the second half had started strong, particularly with respect to non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results over the entire year before deduction of interest and taxes,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the highest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure travel sector performed well while business customers spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year, when seasonal demand was lower and it was expected to profit for the entire year for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Strangers shoot at hotel near Cairo's pyramids
Unknown hooded gunmen opened fire Friday on a hotel near Cairo's pyramids in Egypt without causing any casualties, as a result of an apparent feud with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, Interior Ministry spokesman General Abdel Latif said.
The attack comes as Egypt has received almost no tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloodiedly suppressed protests by his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English Literature classes, students will be required to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also introduce "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other key areas next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Examination Regulatory Office, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new scoring system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was a "broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," emphasizing that GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore do about 138 hours per year.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of the time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the in-depth maths GCSE – as well as the greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of classes.
The program will focus more on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.
This ruling means that a law passed in July in that state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
An 80-year-old welcomes children with a rifle at the Muy for Halloween
Miners ages 9 and 13 were going door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his shotgun.
The 86-year-old told gendarmes he was afraid.
His gun was seized.
Former Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without a trace ever being found, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
“His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte,” he told the newspaper in large print, relying on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, would answer one of the great post-war riddles.
The German secret service, the BND, assured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was completely wrong.
“Since August 1945, Müller’s body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Air Ministry by a commando,” Tuchel said.
He was wearing a general's uniform.
"In the left inner pocket were his service statuses with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district council of Berlin's Mitte district stating that he was buried in the neighborhood's Jewish cemetery.
The president of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is a tasteless enormity.
"The memory of the victims is crudely trodden underfoot," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller was one of the important figures of the Third Reich who were never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his command Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon’s villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or any of the other 10 heroes, to elect him CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma of which he was going to carry the sequelae for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, so that he would get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” adds Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, rush to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to afford the consultation.
Two in five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health spending is in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 free surgical procedures over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas over the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they pile up in vans after fixing the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to go to the villages that need the most help.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push vehicles across rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes: the community throws a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people at each visit,” Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this travelling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a collected pair of glasses or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply can’t afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, a town hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator set, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s a fast pace, but the musicians in the villages usually help the team stay motivated.
“They’re knocking on drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sundays, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts for free over the past year, and they know that their presence can make all the difference for those they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to supporting this travelling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, that funds his association at 60%; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so that he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is a field learning opportunity they don't have at home.
"We have been able to participate in operations to help flush the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their boarding, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt about it,” said Katie O’Malley.
He lays down his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearly extinguished.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” Bwelle added.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons why I do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheaters and classrooms?
No doubt, but by emphasizing his weakness for the crossroads, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Referee of the works of others in his office on Rue Gaston-Gallimard?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher.
Heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the Académie française?
Certainly, but knowing that such a sacred could not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, from which it happened.
They gladly recognized in him a great awakener, animator and federator of their works, but observing that he showed little inclination to produce them himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked tongues were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a sharp glance and weighed with erudition, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who passed for not writing had much and well written.
This book should definitely do him justice.
Yet, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagabondage, and jubilation, as if leaping from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the dealer back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the knot constituting the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: This is a concern of the time.
A few days ago, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our then leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is hunting is completely different.
He does not claim to be the heir of eternal frankness, he refuses the definition.
Analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
The latter, born of the enterprise itself: why, in a country so long established within its borders, so old-fashioned and solidly masonry, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to ward off the turmoil born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without being able to deny it; on the contrary, anxious to regain its sacredness and all the more greedy of unity and indivisibility that it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueness of French identity felt, nothing beats the four steps outside the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escape could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinage only better emphasizes what is our own.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men cluttered with an Ancien Régime indigenous, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confit.
There are founding fathers always honored, and here revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make, and who have killed each other.
There is institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, as well as errors to catch up and attempts to resume.
The France that is leaving, the France that is coming
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could sew the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
In this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity only had a time.
Here it is again under debate, driven by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France going away and the circumspect sketch of France coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We find out that the fireplace was a homeowner.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The border guard stood in the center of the center.
And he who, more than half a century ago, laid down a subject on the idea of a nation, but withdrew from the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will have ended up doing it.
Certainly in a less stiff, more bursting and more subtle form.
But let’s not get it wrong, just as binding.
For far more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is complex enough to manage"
Abducted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage advocacy association "Otages du monde", which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective: to obtain the possibility for the hostages to file a complaint and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital of Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to reunite with their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their life.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, a former grand reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
From the evening of your release, you were on the set of the 20h of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
Especially in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing him because it is dark - Roger Auque.
He tells me we're free, but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tense.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the site of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a T-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boards.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible hustle and bustle.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I come back and there are plenty of them.
The descent from the flight staircase, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull up to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent some from getting on.
The media pressure is enormous.
It does not stop, we are well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We come out of a hole and suddenly we're under the spotlight.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to handle.
But we did the hardest thing.
On the same night, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm also on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like a vacation.
How did the medical exams and the DGSE debriefing go?
I had the right to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grâce the days after my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage-takers.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what's being said.
In particular, the issue of ransoms.
Some things annoy me, some less.
I try to divide things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my cap as president of the association "Otages du monde" which allows me to put distance, and I find it much more interesting to approach.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a problem with semantics.
Hostage-taking should be described as "political" - which is the case most of the time - and the hostages should be allowed access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostages before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why not say to the hostage-takers “you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice”?
It seems to me, however, justified, legitimate, struck by common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and that shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the streets to denounce Morsi trial
Anger is roaring in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, says this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a prank.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial insurges a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to judge Sisi, not the other way around.
Morsi must try Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed outside the Cairo police academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine US states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, "all spouses of military personnel are entitled to a Department of Defense ID card and the benefits that come with it," the minister recalled in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he had directed the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine-state sling began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on the settlements of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on same-sex marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage at about 5,600 active people, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin in the aftermath, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the award ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, are already attending competitions at the highest level, like the young prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he doesn’t like anything as long as he shows up to competitors who surpass him by three heads.
Toronto Mayor Hunts Journalists Who Asked Him About Drug Case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of taking drugs, according to several media outlets.
A video filed with the courts seems to support these suspicions.
Interested Rob Ford has always denied using crack, while acknowledging a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he expelled several journalists from his property who came to interrogate him.
We also think that sometimes the images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced on Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been launched to identify and treat people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive," the health and agriculture ministries said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The ministries are now calling on those who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal was in contact with this kitten between October 8 and 28 to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. as of November 1.
"As France has been free from rabies since 2001, this kitten or the mother were imported from another country, not free," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded "indigenous" case of rabies occurred in December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Epizootic Office (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from the Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"Rabies is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," the ministry said, adding that it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama backtracks on health care reform
Under a barrage of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that “if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their claimants, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “a buzz in the news” about terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received such notices to seek new market assurance.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better-suited health plans for the same price, or even for even less than expected.
“You will come out victorious,” he said.
The Authority announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who take out their own insurance were forced to change plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me speak directly to these Americans: You deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius told the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace in October had failed "lamentably".
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as anyone else,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, as she believed her microphone cut off, by addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, Republican Representative from Missouri, as to whether she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept asking Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel launches special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and warmth at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula One World Champion, took off for free practice at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday with a special helmet drawn by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automobile brand, of his team.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was expected to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, at the trials.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let's not get it wrong.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only addressed to suburbans.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I am addressing all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes neighborhoods above all.
My proposal <0x23>1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, a 50-year-old territorial attaché, today claims to be "100% apolitical" even if he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevenement, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are linked to the left, but if the people on the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them, too.
I don't speak to extremist parties.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program - consultable on the Internet - from many themes supposed to speak to suburbans and especially young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years, the rehabilitation of the function of building guard...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the municipal elections of 2014, this may be fair, he admits."
It's a matter of time and money.
The Suburbs Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven list heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I've been receiving since yesterday don't all come from the suburbs," he said.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedented, that U.S. espionage “had gone too far in an inappropriate manner.”
John Kerry indicated a softening of the U.S.’s defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, espionage “had gone too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, ruled on “autopilot” when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities emerged.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said: “It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government learned of certain things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course 9/11.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he was now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one would feel deceived.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to be blown up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
In the meantime, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said Thursday.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorism organizations due to the sense of frustration generated by the National Security Agency's oversight.
“It’s really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay with us in our mutual commitment to fighting terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term and chairman of the U.S. Senate’s European Affairs subcommittee, said in an interview from Washington.
And I’m going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA’s programs.
The press reports that the NSA captured millions of communications in Europe, which undermined relations with some of the U.S. allies, however the agency’s director said this week that it was inaccurate and a misunderstanding as it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations included documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA intercepted data and communications from the mobile phones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The director of the intelligence services, James Clapper, justified the espionage of the allies by saying that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators are expected to be released in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show "affectionate firmness".
He explained that European heads of state had to be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programs they have been implementing themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do espionage,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Kerry plans to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, beset by Shell's poor performance and a day after the Fed announced it would maintain its support for the economy as expected.
Australian woman appeals imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver appealed the trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of misrepresentations after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she admitted to making up the whole story.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station prior to the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women’s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We obviously had a distressing time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to a heavier sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorated image among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
The French police will arrest the fans of Anderlecht who came otherwise than with the RSCA buses
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain scheduled for Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman of the Brussels police zone, said on Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who wish to attend this Champions League match will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has said that measures have been taken to make it possible to carry out arrests or even police custody," Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated a year ago a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to think about ways to better integrate students who live between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "living together in French".
The organization Vision Diversity has been walking in schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of the stock or that they came from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So, we create projects so that they identify with all of this,” explains Vision Diversity president A<0xC3><0xAF>da Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support to the staff in the transformations we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research center that will give tools to teachers who, sometimes, also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the Université de Montréal, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different educational strategies, that is the real need," she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
