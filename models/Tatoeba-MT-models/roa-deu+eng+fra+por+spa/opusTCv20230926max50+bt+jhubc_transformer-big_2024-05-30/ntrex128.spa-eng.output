Members of the Assembly (AM) in Wales are concerned about 'looking like muppets'
Some Members of the Assembly are bewildered by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This bewilderment stems from plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this may be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his group was concerned "that it would rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A Member of the Welsh Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "discontented" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the jump in pronunciation from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name change, states: “Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option garnered most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring back Assembly President Elin Jones, who should send the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of Assembly Members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say in the question of what they should be called when deliberating on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the country's name change
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether the name of their country will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite over the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin remain silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the older people I’ve spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.”
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize differently,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods that neighbors go to regularly.”
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders hope and that “sooner or later, they will return to the starting point”.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who won’t help the shrines left in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshipping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took over the reins of St. Martin, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants of 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged and, while Father Johnson’s parishioners made plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called it “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left to play the carillon of Riverside Church, of larger size, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese would "try to pass the costs" on to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Dive Boy Searching for Locusts in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for locusts in California on the day locust season opened, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, so he approached with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited to have caught a lobster, but then realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten.
I'm...
He had a broken collarbone," Hammel observed as he reached the boy's side.
“I shouted at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The first responder, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami Beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans boost UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specializing in the hallways of their beauty and style establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 trillion and growing steadily compared to falling sales of fashion and household goods, the largest beauty halls will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successfully surpassed, the same will be done in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this supermarket chain looks for ways to use the shelf space it used to allocate to televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also test its concessions at two Sainsbury's, the first just opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift to buying small amounts of food every day at local stores force supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to battle discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted grocery sales and further monetized these acquisitions.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to split revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of Sainsbury’s 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty halls in ways that enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby breaks <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, left "furious" after television host Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million pound deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the fashion and accessories brand Truly.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced that she was quitting the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones by quitting his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted that her new deals, valued at up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, did not leave time to devote herself to Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The deal had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was shaping up to double Willoughby's fortune of about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was quitting the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source said: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her for the next two decades.
His decision to abandon left all involved utterly astonished.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters, ready-to-sell products."
Experts believe the departure of This Morning’s host, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions because of significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly delay its launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night “no business issues were discussed.”
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of “news presenter.”
“I haven’t given up on anything.”
He said Kim is keen to meet with him again after Trump hailed the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate response” from the US to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s outlook was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
“We got along great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free hostages and bringing the remains of U.S. soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, it was not declared a national emergency, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not requesting international assistance, which complicates things a bit," Ms. Sumbung explains.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still unsure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide aid.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko’s administration, which faces re-election next year.
In addition, it must cope with pressure from Indonesia’s lingering sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch this: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equalises score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal Saturday at London’s Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second bat.
The action sent him over the area and headed to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very far ahead, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think about it too much, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midfielder made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning around making a dribble near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the midfield.
Afterwards, he made a nice pass to the space that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished by throwing the ball into the net of the second post with a left foot kick that Liverpool’s Alisson Becker couldn’t stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at the Estadio San Paolo, in Naples (Italy).
For their part, Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude quake that unleashed waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man as Suspected of Murder After Woman Was Stabbed to Death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to call the police.
Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to catch something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman came to the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was amazed when he discovered what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to re-enter in a few hours.
Someone heard an officer tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At two o’clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon controlling the block of floors.
Anyone with information is asked to email DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, September 30, registration 247.
Cromwell's Parliamentary Statue Becomes Latest Commemorative Success for 'Rewriting History'
Their ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that removing the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
The wrong Cromwell may be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
Cromwell’s magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the 19th-century view and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than at present, an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killer Pig Attacks Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a rancher in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a market stall in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs from a pigsty in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pighole with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-kilo pig had attacked the rancher to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and shattered,” the cousin, to whom they address by his last name, “Wu,” told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan’s family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, it is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the animal.
After pigs were fed to an Oregon rancher in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “shooter.”
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What needs to be done is to have proper respect for them," he said.
The wreckage of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rainfall in the U.S. Southwest.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the U.S. southwest in the coming days.
Rosa caused gusts of wind of more than 136 km / h, a category 1 hurricane from Sunday at five in the morning (Eastern time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressures are beginning to build up in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastwards toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to drive intense tropical rainfall northwards to the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when tropical rain collides with the approaching low pressure, there will be widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical rainfall will cause rainfall of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding is possible with conditions that worsen rapidly.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not at all recommended to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into raging rivers and storms will cause gusty winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rainfall on specific parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains may leave up to two centimeters of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make the roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical squalls will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spikes in late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be some intense temperature changes in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes this involves drastic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the center of the U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 7 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will attempt to recover and re-expand.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., a warm early October is expected, with widespread temperatures hovering around 26 degrees from the Southern Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures could reach up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high above-average temperature probabilities for the east of the USA during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s appearance
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimonies that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, gave Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, politics continued to stand still and the media interrupted their usual schedule to broadcast Friday’s latest news: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a drunken state and that he tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that that had not happened.
It’s likely that more than the 20.4 million people Nielsen commented on Friday have seen it.
The company counted the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen often has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of a playoff football match or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose landlords have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, fueled the lead channel, averaging 5.69 million viewers during an all-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 million, NBC had $2.94 million, MSNBC had $2.89 million and CNN had $2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him yelling at protesters Friday morning as he tried to climb an elevator to attend a hearing before the Judiciary Commission.
As he received these reprimands, broadcast live on CNN, he was dejected.
"Looking me in the face," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued, “You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would tell more in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and broadcasting networks broadcast everything live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh’s Senate candidacy for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate over the following week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was critical, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of ‘Making Politics’ With Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and of undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham (Britain) on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the paper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers’ alleged Brexit plan, saying a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect in LSU Player’s Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a count of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, the police say they admitted shooting Wayde.
A bond of $350,000 has been established, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge East District Court of Instruction released a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a bullet wound to the neck that had hit the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police forensics lab, Southern University police, and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s sports director, thanked local law enforcement for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“These are the things people always care about,” Wade said.
Volcano dumps ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash coating the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with rioters as thousands took part in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours and police used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, the pro-independence groups, with messages such as "neither forget nor forgive", faced unionist protesters shouting "Viva España".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but held by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, as people who were against secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to avoid a rally in support of the National Police.
The demonstration went on, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy about being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” she said.
Despite achieving a vital, though narrow, victory in last December’s regional elections, pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the entrances and the building itself.
At some point, he may have shot the car with a crossbow.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by scoring the second loss to Steven Gerrard in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference. Gary Holt's team rose one place, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, the Gerrards have not yet won any away wins and next Sunday they face the Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points of advantage.
Before, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston is extending its division win streak to six games, and Holt, the starting coach, has not yet tasted the loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities in front of blunt visitor
Holt’s team had to have been one step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson overtook the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow got the deviant shot after interning to top Craig Halkett's header in front of the goal.
The host team settled for letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with standing ball plays.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston sought an entry, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession but couldn’t pass the host’s defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was quite calm.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop of Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor turned down a shot from Scott Pittman with a kick, and Lithgow was far from another move by Livingston.
Livingston's area was constantly filled with long passes, but they were always cleared. Two penalty requests were rejected, one after Halkett's entry on deputy Glenn Middleton and the other for one hand.
Livingston's "Phenomenal" (analysis)
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and squad have barely changed since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the moves, as they only managed to enter the opposing field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy highway from Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by paramedics, but died right there.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that ran away on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from Saturday's crash site.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut off and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation at a high-security prison for men, according to the Directorate of the penitentiary.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still continuing.
Specialists from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, involving eight inmates and affecting a pavilion.
Officers were assisted by minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A spokesperson for the prison service comments: "Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
Violence is not tolerated in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
The Long Lartin Prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical care after an inmate attacked him.
In addition, riot police officers were asked to come to the prison in October last year to deal with a serious altercation in which prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the last hurricanes of Hurricane Rosa cross the desert’s southwest, at risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that "only ten hurricanes have retained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rainfall, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollon Escarpment, in Arizona.
It is likely that between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain will fall, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious issue, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s itinerary will hit Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum gusts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to rest in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout Monday afternoon.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"Torrent rains of between 7 and 15 centimeters are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a possibility of reaching 25 centimeters," according to weather.com.
Afterwards, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move across Arizona to southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger to Rosa or her remains is heavy torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash flooding and debris flows into deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects in an attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
Agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing about the accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, "Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the bravery" of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a lawyer with an admirable track record in the service of the public,” he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh’s candidacy when talking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“It’s five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t want to run, but it’s a race,” he said.
“That’s why I go from place to place struggling to get great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to be held no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, numbers on the rise
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves sweeping the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters hit the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami came after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When it was warned yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, that’s why they were victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it ravaged everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s great earthquake was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "major" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the demolished buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for failing to report that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the warning was issued.
In a footage captured by an amateur and shared on social media, you hear a man standing on the top floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, leading to buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but evacuees still need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has been reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are taking refuge under tarpaulins installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating outlook on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as aid groups were rolling out the disaster assistance gears, some people were lamenting that the removal of experienced co-operators to Palu was not being allowed.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial catastrophe,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolate stories that write the natural catastrophes.
On Saturday, a small child was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the paragliders missing for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“From my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the disclosure of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who participated in the festival held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed one check mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during an ATM refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, burglars robbed a Brink employee who was charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the leisure center and was preparing to refill it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "runned up behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of the money destined for refill.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye, the name he used as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word was of religious importance to him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year as he talked about the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
It went from being Kanye, which means ‘the one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in upper or lower case, with or without a hyphen.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against the civilian population, as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country approaches.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Square that he “would never use the military to repress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking hold throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He claimed that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double I.A. funding.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in AI research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after A.I. announcements from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official A.I. strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the No. 1 in innovation in IA by 2030.
“Doubting the budget for A.I. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. We have our eye on the next breakthrough in the A.I. field,” says Lee.
Double funding means twice the chance that the next big achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s top I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an A.I. system that defeated Othello's best American player, later serving as an executive at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee awarded recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., investigators often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired high-profile people from universities to work at I.A.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its I.A. initiatives.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people from academic institutions just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence hasn’t taken any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether they will change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name will be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum ballot asked the question: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies like the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, by 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their votes.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in the Macedonian referendum on a name change of the country that would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would bring the much-needed investment Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch this: Manchester City's Sergio Agüero dodges Brighton's entire defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling blew up Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the play.
He ran between Brighton's three defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He dodged a defender before overtaking several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Agüero has some problems with his foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League contest.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Aguero received the ball far within the territory of Brighton.
He made a nice left-sided ball pass for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few taps before steering Sterling towards the second stick.
The Sky blues forward threw the ball into the net just before he got out of bounds.
City face Hoffenheim in a group match of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to throw the Rockies a party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they, who triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have playoff opportunities.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still pursuing their first division title.
“Although we didn’t play anything, we can at least step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve ever faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but it seems they are inclined to let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal break on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander's record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
Five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the most important ones. I don't show up, but it's a race, so I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates," he said.
“We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see pettiness, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“We’ve seen it these past four days,” he said, saying the Democrats “were angry, they were bad, horrible and fake.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Commission by naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the booing from the public.
“Remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I expect an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen."
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of views.
He is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of Members of Parliament of the Labour Party who are told that they are not welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment as being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the no-confidence motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe, and it is ironic that these were issues in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the announcement of Friday’s Nottingham East Labour Party meeting, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been like.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "kinder and kinder" policy is already more than forgotten, if it really was implemented at some point.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged by whether or not the party leaders find it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and take positions he would never have agreed with, whether on national security or on the EU’s single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every “censorship” motion or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice that recommended keeping my head down and not making myself heard so much and that that way "would be okay".
But I haven't gotten into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a councilor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, not even in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions or the areas in which I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who pushed for Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this urge to waste time and energy with questions about my allegiance to the Labour Party leader when the country heads for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and utilities.
The real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to voters, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting in what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an unbeaten Ayr climbs to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the game may have decided to some extent the final result, but no doubt Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining game of Tennent's Premiership day.
They now top the table and are the only undefeated team out of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to take better advantage of the opportunities, that gave the home team the victory, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“We’ve been tested in every match and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie commented, “The Ayr deserves the recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned by the Warriors for the match, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of this opponent's disadvantage and Jason Baggot got an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty. Before, just in the halftime, he scored and turned a solo trial, which left the score at 17-5 in favor of Ayr at the break.
However, the Melrose started the second half well and the rehearsal of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be taken out on a stretcher, and, upon resumption of the match, Ayr were ahead with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Ayr captain Blair Macpherson allowed Melrose to take advantage of having one more man with an unconverted rehearsal by Bruce Colvine at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the homers recovered and, when Struan Hutchinson was shown the yellow card for scoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made a rehearsal when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
Climo converted him, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong with a kick and sent the Gregor Henry wing to the bottom for the fifth home rehearsal.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move to the restaurant sector after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though a source at the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "blooming catering market".
"The sea belongs to us": a landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, navy blue flags are waving.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Recovering it is a duty.”
Across Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution from the International Court of Justice by October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens scattered across the country, in the hope that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is waging a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from advancing Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have hampered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues more than three months after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subdue the North is a “chimera.”
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament moves beforehand.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, widespread skepticism reigns over Pyongyang’s seriousness in giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is due to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit between the two leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a set of eccentric oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the runway.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the models’ heads.
Other oversized add-ons were watermelons with jewelry, a sorcerer’s hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of outlandish masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation was reminiscent of a full dive team, snorkeling and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like oversized fashion, you’re in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could start to be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats come with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this hat so impractical that it flooded social networks presented another great creation on the runway: a straw beach bag as big as the model in a swimsuit that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the La Riviera collection by Jacquemus for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I expect to see huge hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued into 2018 with another set of extraordinary test scores reinforced by individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, it reaches his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you can’t rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that are part of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key competence that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK’s Committee on Employment and Skills revealed that, of the reasons employers gave for the difficulties they encountered in filling jobs, 17% were attributable to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities requiring languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of which career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically get ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the only two-digit language spoken, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centers will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you can always choose between several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this subject.
Independent schools in Scotland devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
At the moment, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "competences for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges.
LeBron makes Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for fans hoping to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a few limited minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled for Trump next week, including stops at places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate’s confirmation vote to fill the pending Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s appearances this week, which were tense because of allegations of sexual misconduct and have put an early Senate confirmation vote on hold for at most a week as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November election gain momentum.
President Trump’s campaign said next week’s five rallies aim to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and enlarge the majorities they retain in the Senate and House,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we go into campaigning,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to give his name told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could attract supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have coverage in the Pittsburgh media," as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a push in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team proves they dare to fight to keep hope alive for Sunday’s individual matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum swing pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
"We were six points ahead and now we're four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in their favor and plenty of reasons to be excited, among other reasons for the pair formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
The celebratory guttural screams increased in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game as he and Thomas went down two after two holes.
The putt that gave them the game on the 15th was greeted with a similar shout, from those who broadcast that he believes the American team has not yet been left out.
"What you have to do is redouble your efforts and concentrate on the game," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple from Europe has four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way his energy flows with the bustling public make it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there won’t be other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, the two at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four balls, after forming a pairing with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and Swede in a hole they couldn’t get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see up close because you appreciate the interactions between couples, the tips they give and those they don’t, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead over the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe ahead 10-6 on Ryder Cup final day
Europe start with a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods, leading by four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points, and he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to beat a discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who hadn’t scored much in Saturday’s two games, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes games, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, rejoined Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have it all on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spaniard Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the initial two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, a team recovering from a four-point gap in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says there's 'no chance' they will disarm unilaterally first if they don't have confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations that the continued sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no chance his country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the international body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, including stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence regarding our national security, and under those circumstances, there’s no chance we’ll disarm unilaterally first.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization without further ado, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work toward the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must renounce its nuclear weapons earlier.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, including by objecting to a declaration of ending the war," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader announced to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, adding: “If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles toward U.S. soil after “evil president” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim “rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in advancing toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline set for this: “We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we realize definitive and fully verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn’t go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea denounced his “requirements as those of a mobster.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had communicated to him that the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing sexist culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her senior year.
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of dreaming, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers, and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance, and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it’s not going to change students’ behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco," Czeisler added.
He claimed that the culture of pride in "sleeping overnight" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and good quality sleep should be students' "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the year before during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the entire campus.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal tombs Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to score their first away win since February 4-1 at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team eight points behind the Hearts, outspoken leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack came minutes before halftime and the Rangers' uninspired lineup was not up to the task at any point.
Now, the Rangers fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, behind Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers may be in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after, allegedly, someone threw an object from the visitor background.
Gerrard switched to eight of the starters who won the game against Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 Livingston players who snatched a point from the Hearts last week and would have rejoiced at the way his organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored within two minutes of the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her off.
Keaghan Jacobs drew a foul in depth for Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send her out by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos no doubt felt he was being penalized in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson turned a deaf ear to the Colombian’s request.
The Rangers scored two shots to goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely found it difficult to deal with Lassana Coulibaly’s header and boring Ovie Ejaria’s pitch.
Although Livingston’s 34th minute goal came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn’t cope with a deep play on Jacobs’ standing ball.
Scott Arfield didn’t react when Declan Gallagher pitched the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
At halftime, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's could have taken more lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a corner head that didn't come in.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as a Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and re-inject them.
A trial of the vaccine is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed at the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to mock the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white person and he asks me how I can like Trump if he’s racist.
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began Matt Damon's sketch show in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's brawl to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the audience that he had had a hard time behind the scenes wearing that cap.
“They messed with me.
I was told not to go out with my hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I’m asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and added that he was going to put on his superman cloak, because that meant no one could tell him what to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments received booing from the public on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The study was totally silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West baffled many when he went onstage to sing I Love It dressed up as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING FROM THE LOT."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was simply "being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothing, or supporting their art) who I consider is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology to my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been named Snoop Lion, not forgetting the late music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying those on-screen roles often conveyed to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he thinks it's "quite important" to address this issue.
"Personally, it seems pretty important to me right now, where have we been wrong about masculinity?" he said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?”
Kit believes television may have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it’s clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ends next summer, stating that he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard’s play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he’s ever pulled out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense she has given me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose portrayed Ygritte, Kit's character Jon Snow's love interest, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly throughout parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has almost completely decreased, Chinese health authorities said at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican senators and claims that these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were being propelled by commentators and "far-right" websites.
"Lyings, lies and more vile lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
The information reportedly included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person on the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel session regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with Waters’ office and made public the data of a Waters staffer, according to the Capitol.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not at all responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement prompted immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“He denies this information with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests not the temperance necessary to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
He must not rebel.
He must not question the accuser's motives.
It must maintain calm and serenity.”
It appears that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom detractors accused of appearing too angry during Thursday’s appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to oust Waters in the midterm election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very serious,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations.”
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," he continued, "and that they are held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English Review: Rowan Atkinson's spy parody falls short
It has now become a tradition to look for nods to Brexit in any new film with a British focus. It seems like this is what it takes to do with this new installment of the parodic action and comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satisfaction about how clearly insane we are be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his jumpy eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to screw up for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking film lovers.
Of course, it’s the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to splurge on glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean, and a pinch of that guy who touched a single note on the theme of Fire Carts that was touched at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, at its origin it was based on the mysterious traveller and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the already forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there are one or two good moments.
I loved watching Johnny English approach a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers hit the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps in the face, but the humor gets pretty short and is oddly superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comic ingredients seamlessly.
The humor seems more aimed at children than adults and, to me, Johnny English’s absurd misadventures are not as ingenious and accurate as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated topical argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the dismay of the on-duty agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the straw that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who is watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself in this character who is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, since all active spies are in danger, he will have to turn to someone who is retired.
That's got to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches in a fancy school, though gives unofficial classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since it's a spy academy similar to Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his long-suffering former comrade Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a sympathetic role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not taken advantage enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
Definitely, they were used thoroughly in that last sequence, but, as funny and loud as it is, the ensemble still conveys a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies it is drawing up a plan for Britons to work four days a week, but pay five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan that Britons would work on four days a week, but charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business owners to allocate the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would “fit” into the party’s plans and economic agenda to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
This change to a four-day week has received support from the Trade Union Congress as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: An announcement of a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
“It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day working week is definitely an issue the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the working-class economy as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At the moment, however, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of party policy and is not going to be discussed at this time.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to lay out his idea for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to regain powers of "anonymous directors" and "tapped" by companies providing public services.
The shadow minister’s plans also include the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies will not recover all their shares, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of the shares of private sector companies must be allocated to employees, which would mean an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed by at least a week the final vote for confirmation as Supreme Court justice and also raises the question of whether the results could influence any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could uncover information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, sharp.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
“I already have a decision made about Brett Kavanaugh and would dismiss the charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she names have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive poster of stars gathers for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people travel to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved 12 years after reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “clictivism,” which is called the stance we take when we believe we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have managed to get world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.2 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", an association of investors and executors based in the United Kingdom united with a common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, they have proposed to provide Rwanda with $ 35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citi contributors.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens contributors like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, “The Power of Nutrition” ambassador, told the crowd during an April 2018 concert in London.
The group also stated that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A contributor to Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard road and on many occasions we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already achieved, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will have at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to carry out blockade on Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
“If necessary,” Washington could resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, just as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods of addressing this issue.
"The United States, with its navy, has the ability to ensure that the waterways remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed people attending an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia basically consists of harnessing and replacing fuels,” he warned, while pointing out that Russia can only do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims come as the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve it of its role to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do so, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says will make Berlin hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which reaches a value of $ 11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is purely economic and is yet another sign of unfair competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after holding a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow last September.
The US stance has, however, met with rejection from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The industry-leading organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm election.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being posed.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and for women to finally be among the leaders,” she said.
"After November 6, I'm going to seriously consider running for president."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a town hall appearance and said he was “leading the country the wrong way.”
“I’m really concerned about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said that “it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote.”
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for the 2020 election.
58% of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% of respondents did, however, support their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other well-known Democratic Party members discussed the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation that my son is going through, for everything that has happened since he came back, is well known to the other families who suffer the effects of PTSD and other injuries with which our soldiers come back,” he told the audience who gathered at a pro-Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans returning with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all other members of the army, have given to their country.
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to get a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district filed a “friendly” letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name has not been disclosed in the "Grace v. Sessions" case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner “and her children, who are members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Migration Appeals (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in the country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
“According to federal law, all asylum applications must be decided by virtue of the particular facts and circumstances of the application and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae states.
In addition, the lawyers said in the letter that the policy that denies immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy by claiming that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and “assume a necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their countries of origin on the grounds of persecution or threats based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion may apply for asylum,” Sessions said when announcing the directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll rises in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her feverish baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few drowned belongings left in an effort to recover what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous, also very strong aftershocks.
He couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to be safe.
I was trapped in the wreckage of the crumbling wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're all right."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Bullying’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily’s payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. Congressional election, something China flatly denies.
Trump’s indictment of Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials pointed to Reuters as a new phase in a growing Washington-initiated campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to post ads to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels on imports from both sides.
China’s countervailing tariffs that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall on exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, which is one of the top exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, China “is further intensifying that pressure with ad postings in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s cherished tradition of free speech and free press to try to post a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, you only see a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China may have about the worrisome trajectory that their country’s economy is taking, as the media is controlled by firm pressure from the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant newspapers evaded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women ahead of midterm vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many well-known Republicans are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that there may be a setback, especially on the part of women, in the upcoming midterm votes.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and many Republicans have said they want to move forward with the vote.
"In these kinds of matters it's not possible to back down," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters disgusted with the matter.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters rallying at the doors of the Senate chanted “November is coming!” at a time when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to move ahead with Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, the Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is out of the question," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the repercussion is already very relevant, and indeed it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided women in suburban neighborhoods and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said there could be a setback if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
“This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s no longer just a matter of the committee vote or the final vote, or even whether they sit on the bench for Kavanaugh; it’s also about the way Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who side with the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents definitively or likely believe Ford’s testimony, while 35% say they definitively or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s statements, as well as at least those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez said the Supreme Court nominee showed his genitals at a party while he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend. A company that is based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology so users can create their own “online personal data storage” or POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique about personal online data storage is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills needed for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers included in the staff who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change is going to be introduced where all of their business models are completely changed from one day to the next.
“We’re not going to ask permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created at Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the cleric who won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with "greater courage", advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I will never be able to reach his height, but they were very sobering."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a wreath after the parade, which featured the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "a privilege for him to be a part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when he is shown such a large backing."
MMA fans were up all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay up all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so that in the end you will not be allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose poster featured 13 fights, six of which were included on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some weren’t surprised after they had to stay up early in the morning just to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the move to cartoons as “a heavy joke.”
“There’s government regulation regulating content that airs after 6 a.m. and it wasn’t appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they will modify the show to include British viewers in the next editions.
“When I think about the option of relay, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn’t do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, a lot of messages were received and not everyone was kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise that next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally have done. We tried to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we passed.
This is a very unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumphant.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn’t realize until he got to high school that “not everyone was like me.”
On Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs show, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in talking about gay rights was to convey "hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to underestimate the importance of winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who showed himself as an outcast, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it wasn't socially acceptable that you like boys and girls."
He said, “Until today, that sense of inferiority and being different has been what really gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wasn’t disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to convey that “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year to the Oscar winner, who takes her 20 years, although she specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’ve lived so long since you were so young” (he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone the same age who’s gone through the same ups and downs as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all the answers would have revolved around 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him I wasn’t going to be able to be in the front row,” he said.
“I had his hand between my hands when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine in an Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This was also the fact that inspired him when he chose his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the biennial event to set a record for the 12th time, was ousted by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often done for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to settle for cheering in a few moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game on the field and be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of the drivers, not even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough continuously punishes with wrong hits.
And, if the field is no longer discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they’ve played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points short at the start of the 12 individual games, started in an impressive way, Mickelson’s game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, neither could he say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role I had today, he slapped me on the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably couldn’t imagine it playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that’s how it came out and that’s how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the latest in an entire Ryder Cups trajectory that had never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 equals, though Furyk said his presence contributed many more intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s witty, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players loved having him as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It’s much more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish the others by stepping on their heels by a minimum margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but for very little," said Bjorn, portrayed, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead him with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have one goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that’s all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no more and no less than the best players in the world.”
Proud of what his players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I don’t want to get ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are the individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, you put your entire golfing ability to the test.
That’s the message to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s time to put your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as pairs, with the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends in the last few days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe performed the "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the entire course,” Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but will not be made until at least next year due to faulty systems and progressively rising costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship leading the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to statements by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery thwarted the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy applied for in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and very reduced acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so they can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) will be outdated by the time they start serving, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – half the personnel that were on the former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future updates.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), instead of the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is "leaving out ships capable of deploying".
The officer said the problem has worsened over time, because the old ships were decommissioned, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything found is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bats and sopranos, as well as the riparian Daubenton and long-eared brown bats from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of bat calls and what species make them.
A report and a habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating grasslands and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat because of the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticidal papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks from domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind,
but, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts in the field, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even opened Scotland’s first and only bat reserve in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says it’s the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still a lot unknown about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, since a breeding colony can be involuntarily destroyed and 400 females and young could be killed, which would mean annihilating an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations at the same time as his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled rape allegations as “fake news,” and says people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to denounce the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying him $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already amassed 142 million followers hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, branded the report as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Ballon d’Or winner looking into the camera.
“They just want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same old story.
They want to become famous just by mentioning me, but it is so, I can't help it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations that appear in what they have called “an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy,” Reuters reports.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and that he had disappointed that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to police and that they took photographs of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to reach an out-of-court settlement because she had “terror at reprisals” and was concerned “about being humiliated in public.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is trying to overturn the agreement, as she remains traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged assault occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has switched to Juve, an Italian football great for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing automakers
Britain "would regret it all its life" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “worrisome” for Toyota UK to tell the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the repercussions of delays on customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain breaks up with the EU by the end of March, there will be production stoppages at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have shown their fears about leaving the EU without a deal, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns referred to by automakers revolve around the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just in time” or “last minute” production mode, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars to order.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be an interruption at the border that, depending on the sector, could lead to delays and the shortage of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in such a case production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which establishes future relations with the EU, is “precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at border crossings.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to seize the opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“Toyota’s evidence, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue what, so far, has been a tremendously successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would stop, but it warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the Unite union at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that outlines our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed another week" as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian election, links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation of whether or not Trump decides to fire the deputy attorney general and thereby compromise Mueller’s independence has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he himself was carrying to try to relegate the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, among news reports where it is claimed that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was at the time at the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate for a week the allegations against Kavanaugh, although this would mean delaying the vote of the Senate plenary.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “No date has been set, it could be this week or another could be postponed, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide as we go along and I will report to the press, as I usually do.”
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked what the motives were.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting grandiloquently, though he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they brag."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
“The president holds more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him,” he said, while quoting without evidence: “We’ve contrasted those numbers.”
The press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask the president of the United States directly, I think it's far better than doing them to me.
We tried to do it many times, and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why it was so, where he made a rash and sometimes bizarre appearance before the journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of State for Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish for them to remain with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on the central power.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit have followed in which the decisions expected this autumn were chosen.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible no-deal scenario.
I know all this must be very puzzling for you.
That is why I would now like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, irrespective of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that reinforce and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie received emergency surgery after suffering a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He came into the band and collapsed right there,” Reed said.
Both the trainers and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for in-depth examination.
A Tennessee State staff member told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage done" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, sophomore redshirt, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher property transfer tax when they buy property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher property transmission tax when they buy property in the UK and the extra money raised with this measure will be used to shelter the “homeless”, according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the property transfer tax will be imposed on those people who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury hopes to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to go to the "homeless"
The additional money raised from the increase in the tax on the transfer of estates to foreign buyers of property in the United Kingdom will go towards aid to the “homeless”, Theresa May announced today.
The move is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in the farm transmission tax will be taxed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to incentivise government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are bought by non-UK residents, causing rising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas (especially in the capital) have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the transmission tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of maintaining very high property prices by eagerly buying land without intention of using it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing problem.”
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to evictions for no reason.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means fixing the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people living outside the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult for many people to achieve, and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become a coach of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the Northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in League One (the third league division of England), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid and it’s something he’s always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage a club successfully.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's leader include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he switched to such established names at such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club correspond, without a doubt, to those of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I have achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it should be.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the Hearts coaching staff.
Afterwards, he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and moved St. Mirren from being on the brink of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled, referring to when he took over Alloa.
“I always believed that management was what I did best, much more than playing.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I was able to make a very good living with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’ve managed to do it, it’s the time of my adult life where I’ve felt better, without a doubt.”

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heatwave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub groups and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits fell by 4.8%, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consultancy, which was in charge of compiling the figures, said: “The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased by 2.8% their profits, although restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant business activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, versus most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from the heat, though not as drastically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose by up to 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman of RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home activities market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
The overall increase in sales at pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand implementations.

One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents’ backs
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts behind the backs of their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth in fake Instagram pages
The news has sharpened fears of sexual content being published
20% of students said they have a "principal" account they show their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has sharpened fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a sanitized "main" account that they showed their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who happened upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter saw a teenager encouraging others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teens are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the directive of the athletics federation of Scotland
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to serve on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete and its chairman, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the entire world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from having her on their board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I like being the athletes’ spokesperson and I hope I can contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert at the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or how far I would go.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
Announcement of teaspoon that compares mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A teaser company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing mothers who breastfeed cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what is supposed to be the world’s “first silent teaser,” consumer tech company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music showing mothers telling the story of the freedom given to them by the new milk pump.
Four real women dance in a hay-filled barn as a dance floor, along with some cows, with lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Order them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, I'm milking my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created great controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the “horrors” of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before they give birth to produce milk, with the exception that they are taken away from their babies days after giving birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: “Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?”
Another comment was, “What a far more wild announcement.”
However, other people defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "distracting".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'm sure I'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I don't go around it anymore.
It’s a product genius,” one woman told us.
Another person told us: “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the fasteners.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump out milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and discreetly engages inside the breastfeeding bra, which makes it possible for its users to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pump.
This isn't the first time the Elvie bomb has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Minors Discreetly Displaced to Texas Border Camp
The number of detained immigrant minors has risen considerably, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has practically remained at the usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take in a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Around 80 percent of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large portion of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In their effort to prosecute minors faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum of one month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to workers at the shelters.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered fit for amparo will be deported as soon as possible.
According to workers in the shelters and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the greater the likelihood of them suffering from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to flee.
Advocates say these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as the Tornillo facility, where signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
In addition, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria Calls on US, France and Turkey 'Occupation Forces' to Withdraw Immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the country’s war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the right conditions were in place for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "seeding irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the deal had “clear deadlines” and has expressed hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, a dismissal or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would be without a doubt “The most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!”
At the moment there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, peak-time indices have doubled to $1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to $1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for major nightly news shows.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t figure out,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor,” an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the response Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families can reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information crosses the line when you realize that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours debating the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment of disproportionate pride,” in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of scabrossas.
As far as I’m concerned, I’ll never see Super Mario in the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s partly what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he tells us about the alternating cast of Trump’s show and its daily twists of the plot (whether it’s going into an NFL fight or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refugee inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when in those days we were doing all those crazy shows and people were telling us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss tells me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in the tighter midterm elections of the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise the influx of money is coming to Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This newly redesigned residential district of Pittsburgh has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th district, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a campaign funding contest between the parties’ main financial arms, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, though after it backtracked, it said.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization administration team.
State Department officials decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of about 140 million US dollars in 2017 for, among other matters, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was for the conference to go ahead, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, diplomats say, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman in Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to treat the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next planned step could be special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence on the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also leading this investigation into the possibility that the Trump campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to run again to voters, and perhaps finally to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionalities, and I am not suggesting that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor that of his European counterparts.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the war.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, only the West would have had to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good mood since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the Times’ explanation is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation that the FBI has requested into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position in the Supreme Court is upheld despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these exams, we will face a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador’s house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles at the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"We managed to get a good point, since Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game believing we could get something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, the tie was perhaps a fair outcome.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went all out and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult match because they already got a good result in the previous match. But, with all the audience supporting us, I am sure that we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now you notice an overall atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is fine, the guys are enjoying it a lot and we are having a good training.
I am hopeful that we will be able to move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success.”
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose sleep
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this issue.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those options can be a cost-determining factor.
Incorporate in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses, or insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of legal battles.
Get a health care power to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that the professionals fulfill your own wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You can also prepare a power of attorney for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you become disabled.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just finance that’s at stake: which doctors to deal with?” asks Martin.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything needs to be planned.”
Man shot several times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
A man with a rifle was shot several times as he walked home after leaving at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m., as a "random act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are non-fatal and police have appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said.
With communications blocked, relief officials have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that lies closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Belt of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and often suffers from frequent earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami on December 26 that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coastline, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that shattered dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it recalls the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) experienced a series of large-scale earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took away her phone.
Palin has been placed in pretrial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanor offenses, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering in the reporting of a domestic violence crime, and possessing a drunken weapon, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he punched him in the face.
Several veterans’ groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, which is northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van to carry out an attack last October on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and caused “intentionally” serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to request the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury presented Saipov with a 22- count indictment that included eight counts of murder with the help of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal New York case was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953, after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that his attack was inspired by watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be raised in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should handle Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should take over negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK "would have already left" if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided ranks has been highlighted even more as a group of pro-remaining Tories have joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the compromise plan that was signed in Chequers amid attacks from Brexit supporters, their opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlash, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and “chaos.”
MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers’ plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position of responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have gone out by now,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
In his statement opposing the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the European Union is completely false.”
Pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular among our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually take to the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to May, he added: “Prime Ministers hold their positions when they keep their promises.”
Farage told protesters that politicians would have to be made to “feel the heat” if they were to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We will mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay toured the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists were waving Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security concerns they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can deploy the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“This is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all possibilities of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider all possibilities of running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a city meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.”
One Arrested for LSU Sims Player’s Gun Murder
The Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head that eventually led to his death,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde went to defend a friend and got shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the crime scene, in possession of a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 1.98-meter-tall native of Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, starting in 10 of them, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s orders would have an important role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the pits and let Hamilton race in the group queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strong one lap later and stood behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead after an action with the wheels almost stuck that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior free at the risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and placed seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race while clinging to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Eventually, he pitted on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by regaining Raikkonen's fourth position.
It’s been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman in letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job of finding a perfect match," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday over her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false,” he said.
“When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say, ‘But I didn’t.
I didn't."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Well, wait a minute.
No, we have not leaked it," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.”
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented: “I’ll tell you one thing: that’s been really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars mended Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the comeback game Saturday 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants scored an initial two-goal lead thanks to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local tie before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen’s two goals secured his victory.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe’s men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively start period, Sullivan put the home team back in the mood to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to equalize the match in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the match with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match as he reached the end of the second half and secured victory with his team's fifth goal as the end approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to scourge the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the town of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, which was being hit by a heavy swing.
He stood firm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and many people could not be contacted," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told AFP.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says man missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has gone missing, after it said the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the sinking plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon it could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
"That's an extremely good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors carrying out near-dock improvement work also assisted in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation safety net data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
Analyst presents chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended the presentation of their arguments on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting her previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers’s during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s van that night, Sanford said he was “lying, because my van was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated they had met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop moved away from its origins of political messaging and dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop conscious popular again.
Performers like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York nanny sues couple for firing her after 'racist' text
A New York nanny is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to an “extortion” case.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she discovered that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK PERSON,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing his mess, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that his former nanny, who was African-American, had done a lousy job and was instead expecting a Filipina, the New York Post reported.
Maurice was paid for a day’s work and sent home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the firing with the intention of receiving $350 a day compensation for the six-month internal job position for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that things aren’t done that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying that the termination of Maurice’s employment was the most reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
“My wife had sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the lawsuit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that he was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to go for someone that way?
That’s not a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It was hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s so funny to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before taking inspiration from a toy bear to write the children's book, was confident his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "bittersweet" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a very quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” he said.
“But since Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who accomplishes something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was urgently transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he wasn't expected to make it," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly running out and leaving her system.
She had died ahead of time and everything was going out.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not howl, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, alien to the terrible experience that was going on.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I bowed my head and tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicides are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up everywhere.”
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards “so people know there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit quietly, you have to talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling depressed or anything like that,” he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t even look at them.
He said his death was a big trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: "Leave a void in the whole family.
He's left us torn apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could really get something like what I was requesting (an investigation limited in time, limited in scope), maybe we could bring in a bit of unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going awry” amid a partisan shutdown.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
Their refusal is entirely due to chronology.
If, as expected, Republicans fail, their attempts to secure the man they want for the nation’s highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling on senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Deserter Figures 'Fall' With Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and high tariffs charged by human traffickers, have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and they are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved remarkably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed broadly to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will by no means be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves," Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says he's not fit to serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a “hysterical” and that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she’s hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used the excitement to deny allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
At the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the accusations against him “grotesque and clearly coordinated defamation” organized by some angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her view, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would challenge Kavanaugh in the event he was confirmed in office and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll just say one thing: If you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won’t be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, you won’t even be fit to be in the court you serve in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible sentences against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would override certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, unbiased person to go to court and expect us to think it’s all right,” Pelosi said.
And women have to wield it.
It’s a justified diatribe, it’s months and years of fury overflowing, and she can’t let him go without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, do I?"
She went on to say, “I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but that she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then he continued with what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cogote and dragged me down a ladder.
“Don’t let them ever see you cry,” he said.
“They have no idea you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they think they’ve cornered you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which she had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came to her mind that there was no reason not to explore the idea of her running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was well underway, he lagged behind in fundraising, so it was promised that he would not re-enter the race unless he raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech announcing that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on attracting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism) that she choked.
“The logical thing would have been to think that I had had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you going to put on my tombstone?
“Did he cry?”
U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvoes of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while much remains to be done, a split between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by putting tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in goods, taxing half of the goods entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent retaliatory measures, recently applying tariffs of five to ten percent on US products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match U.S. attacks, and the world’s second-most powerful economy is unlikely to slow down anytime soon.
Getting Washington back would mean giving in to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing can set the stage for a slump in the economy in either country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have acknowledged so far,” said Abigail Grace, Asia-focused associate researcher for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has already lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
“The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normalcy.
All conditions were already in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country and in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris (France).
The United States now has six consecutive losses on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water in the 16 par 3 hole, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players to have never scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell 5 and 4 to the player with the lowest classification of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most tournament wins of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very hard year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m very, very happy to have been able to get the cup back.
It is an achievement of the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help," said an excited Garcia after the European team's victory.
Now he passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, as I’ve grown up watching this man,” said 23-year-old John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, lagging only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up to the situation in Europe.
But we screwed it up.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have made a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it is up to us to bow our heads.
They have overtaken us.”
