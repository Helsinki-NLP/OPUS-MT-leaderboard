European inflation slid into food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is primarily due to the rapid rise in food prices.
The price increase in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro zone, registering - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent, announced the Statistical Office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg said.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut basic interest on the pretext that the decline, coupled with rising commodity prices and reduced forced unemployment, would trigger an inflation spiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "we have to negotiate" on inflation so that later it does not have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, beat the record of twelve years; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation soared in the euro area as a result of rampant food and energy prices.
Wheat forward prices rose by 88 percent and soybeans reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while by 2009 it will already decrease to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 percent over the next 3 or 4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double interest rates in 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of the socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one-fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach even the limit necessary to have any parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who judged the economic situation of the country especially bad, while another 46 percent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the more hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as next year is concerned, the majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate and only a tenth expects an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, higher than any previous Gallup poll, said the prime minister performed poorly rather than well.
13 percent of the respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány very much, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of the respondents.
54 percent of the population do not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to control the discontent experienced in front of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the riots of October last year 35% estimated that it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, currently this proportion is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) believes that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation answered that they would safely participate and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
By comparison, only 55 per cent of the population would surely participate in "a general election to be held this Sunday" and another 15 per cent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of school fees, 79 percent of the service of medical consultations and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of the rights to study, the payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average increase in the price level of 16 percent was maintained by the hypermarkets of the Budaörs gold trade triangle, with the difference that this year VAT has not been increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year, the Napi newspaper’s usual Christmas basket also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs gold trade triangle, but in all hypermarkets growth was well above 1,000 HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already "shot" in December last year, so there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers the fact that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below nine thousand HUF, today they can not do it even for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast, walnut and poppy seed steak.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of Coca-Cola with a redeemable two-liter bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan’s basket it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent the prices listed in Napi’s basket.
Comparing the values of last year’s most expensive basket with that of this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year, the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas time last year the price was increased by VAT.
It was precisely this process that shattered trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to be applied to each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the merchant misplans the speed of a product’s circulation, he may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was higher by 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two holiday seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of consumer necessities grew more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some basic necessities, recorded in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 percent.
So, for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive and last year compared to the base, there was registered, in the worst case, only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all the indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic increase in prices even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking by pallets the preserved food.
On Wednesday morning, large queues were formed in front of the boxes in all three stores because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that inside the country the sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the incomes are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
Many hospitals save money with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections caused primarily by the improper application of antibiotics have been reported in hospitals.
The prevailing hygiene conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the doctor-department head of the National Center of Epidemiology.
In many hospitals, even disinfectants are saved.
Not long ago, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital earlier this year.
One injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon after had to return to the hospital as a result of the MRSA infection and since then has not been able to perform a major surgical intervention because of the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multidrug-resistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents has been recorded, for the rest there is no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
SA infections (e.g., throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once antibiotics are exaggerated or improperly applied, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and quickly spread in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or sepsis, primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with the weakened body, the elderly or people of low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, nurses attend them in rubber gloves and masks and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are screened for the presence of MRSA in their body, but even this cannot prevent infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of the formation and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Because this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate those who carry MRSA in their bodies.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when MRSA infections already occur visible in the patient, said the doctor-department head of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes rigorous orders for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be done to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less common in the case of ambulant patients or in basic care," said Karolina Böröcz.
Save money with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, however, also in this sense considerable faults are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately you can also experience - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favorable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a higher probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where the appropriate preventive measures are followed, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the contagion of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is fought against.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multidrug-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative blood alcohol control of police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the district XXII police commander has been made.
The possibility that the since resigned commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passerby, drove drunk or in a stunned state can be excluded, said Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Attorney General of the Capital, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary blood alcohol control that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before getting behind the wheel.
The then-chief of the district XXII police station, on Tuesday with his private vehicle as he turned to Kossuth Lajos street of the district XXII, ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(The latter fact, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when folding.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three credit limit agreements worth a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million in Budapest on Friday to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million to finance transport and environmental protection projects from the Hungarian budget, to be carried out from the cohesion fund grant, of which the parties had previously signed a credit contract worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million credit contract is also earmarked to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this objective of Hungary, on the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million will be decided later, by extending the loan contract.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the subject of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
The agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will again address the issue of whether or not to modify the original contract and how to do it.
According to János Veres, this could take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, free of charge for keeping the loan at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that previously little mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buy in the EU’s even cheaper market, which will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slope apartments and beach villas.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Coast of the Sun", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy properties in the especially cheap area of Rus.
The capital Sofia can also be attractive, as the commercial and office spaces promise a quick return on investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, being able to be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their lives and their way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot developers are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and in the ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 or old houses in poor condition between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, and the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important to them.
The second category are the buyers of villas (Bulgaria in December was included among the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group are real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of profiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent.
The increase in the price of real estate considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the Six by Hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the expert level meetings will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at ministerial level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are deliberating on the Bali Roadmap on post-emission reduction efforts, set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
At present, lively discussions on this issue are taking place between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to agree that compared to the situation in 1990, by 2020 the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to provide material and technological aid to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, foreseen in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
The Six for Hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Hydrology Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU commits to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, regardless of whether or not the “post-2012 agreement” will be signed, and is willing to commit to a decrease of even 30 percent if the other large developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gabor Fodor pointed out that the countries signatories to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states committed to comply with an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases responsible by 6 percent with respect to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will meet - says the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
A lot is at stake in Bali, since within two years the UN will have to sign the international agreement on long-term climate policy, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reduction, whose need was warned in its most recent scientific partnership that the IPCC Peace Prize is being dealt with.
With this, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2o C in the average temperature of the Earth could not be prevented, a fact that according to the scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army Recruits on YouTube
British army units at a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are checked on the general body of operations of Kandahar, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
Already 139 recordings from air force soldiers have been uploaded in this way to the Internet and its "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the British army’s presence abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots – defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC – instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned by the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos appear in the distributor, for example on the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan numerous videos recorded in real operations have been uploaded to the Internet, but the British military is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with freely downloadable shooting video games, called America's Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers.
Bowl and savory cake at Christmas party of ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a toast and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how power is fun.
The state offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
The children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts for Christmas of the Orphans and for Christmas of the Missionaries the relatives of the soldiers who are currently serving missions abroad will be invited, as well as a reception for the press.
This portfolio will allocate $25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and the six hundred ministry workers are expected to attend approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the wallet party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a raffle.
The ANF Christmas cost HUF 4,700,000 and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party to be held by a contest management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a costume.
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucia’s day on December 7.
The CNAJ did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s words of greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear suit or evening dress.
The health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of HUF 400 000.
Labour Minister Monika Lamperth, on the other hand, is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty guests are invited to attend, who – as the press department reported – will drink only coffee and salty cake, so the party will cost no more than HUF 350 000.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai instead will simply toast with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The holiday party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, the workers of the MF celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and as communicated by the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech by the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environment portfolio could not report on the budget of the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will form a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stoppage will begin.
This action will surely cause great difficulties in transport, since the railway traffic will be stopped completely and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
In the afternoon of Friday the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday that will be held jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will also be formed to coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will go on strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not inform about the date of the end of the strike started.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for a strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that the public health law will only be voted on at very late hours of the night, or perhaps near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning may stop a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the companies Volán.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite time, others for a definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours will be on strike the workers of the Collective Transport Company of Budapest, the Airports of Budapest from 7 am to 9 am, will hold a strike of four hours the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electricity and Thermal Energy Industry, the Trade Unions of Educators called for a strike of 2 and the Trade Union of Educators 2 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will go on a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Sector Workers (SDTSSS), which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new way of calculating pensions that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, in the case of early pensions, the possibility that deserving occupations can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the rail sidelines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, established in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
The company's "risk warning" reads: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term there may be violent ethnic clashes".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of such an event, added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life handed over the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country."
We are reminded that since the autumn of 2006 the reorganization of Hungary's radical and far-right groups has received increasing publicity and impetus, and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations that call themselves "national self-defense associations" have been formed in the country.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civilian organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the state," they add.
They said: all this is done in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and with political parties.
For highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, numerous neighbouring states have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar way as, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the mass riots of gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, yet the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - remembers the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes which certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital research director Attila Juhász told the news agency: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and it has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - which next year will be less - workdays are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America, the holidays are not unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between a national holiday, a state holiday and a public holiday.
The holidays are mainly related to religious holidays and historical ephemeris.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, as well as the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven holidays written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on October 23, commemorating the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th we celebrate the foundation of the State, on May 1st the Labor Day, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day festivals, Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, which is why we often bridge when there is only one working day before or after the holiday.
In exchange for extended weekends, during the previous Saturdays you can not be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
On the other hand, it is not mandatory for companies and service institutions which, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during the holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from 24 December, life in the country practically stops, since according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with mid or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda around the Labor Day will be modified so that then, for four successive days, workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day, so that in exchange Friday, May 2nd will be a festive day.
The other change relates to the feast of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, you will have to work instead of Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year during the holidays you can rest, since from December 24 will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
6 Small Deterrents to Bitter Your Colleagues' Lives
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass us by without realizing: all of them are part of our daily Folklore at work.
You have to decide if you adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
I'm sorry, I forgot to let you know that you've been picked up from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the matter, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message to you (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time the matter is settled by apologizing.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bitteren up the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There is nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, an office tool or your phone and you can’t find them.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Do not take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for stealing their things.
Do not take envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out ahead of time.
Are you gossiping about your colleagues' private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the private life of your colleagues!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when he shares his innermost secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even if others also know the things about him.
Are you on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or good, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think about what others should do your work, your unscheduled tasks, your work for term.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you should stay at home, let them know, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront your absence the next day.
Screams, laughter, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but suddenly get rid of the laughter of your colleagues?
Have you ever involuntarily heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear?
Do not annoy your colleagues with your rattles, chants, conversations aloud (less when you do them above their head), kicking, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontents aloud.
All these can be annoying, even if they are not deepening at the moment in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something on time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don’t allude to the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or to the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and Sneakers: Very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear a comfortable jog even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be distracted, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning traffic jam.
It sounds a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones is added the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national musical life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam looks totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although again it is in fashion the garage style rock, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, he played in the ensemble of Yonderboi until he started his independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The broader audience knew the ensemble that initially performed only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected their first album released in 2002 among the 50 most important national records, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, able to sell also in the western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they gladly wear this label.
The group reacted as they should: they prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead will open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to airiness, to flight is fine, but in addition to the airiness of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds loudest, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millennium György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the channel mr2 Petõfi that lately broadcasts from morning to night popular music. This station brought to the ears of the listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are performing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two kinds of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the West of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty frequent the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see more and more people attend our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works solo and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, as many of us started our career in their group and from there embarked on another path.
hvg.hu: In the hit list of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and sell our album with these successes.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of the good-voice soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women – namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh – which was later baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly that way or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material of the album, we thought that something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically at the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas too.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked that hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and not louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their songs.
Also on stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song is also about it, about forgetting for a while our ego, who came from and where it goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have liked to have made others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most work on?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition really none, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want the groove to work and then, little by little everything got in its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
Treacherous Stock Broker Risks Billions for His Inferiority Complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Commercial Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, undoubtedly, with good abilities.
He intuited a long time ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard by his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s responses according to the French media, such as Le Monde, is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
The crisis is not just in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he says in his responses.
In the summer, he managed to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
I saw this opportunity coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those clients would start to have problems.
However, this crisis was not meant to affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
“When I already won my first 500 million I didn’t know how to notify him,” Kerviel confesses and adds, that he hasn’t left anything for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not made.
He even misled the bosses, even as the Eurex Stock Exchange became interested in his business.
Risk turned into profit.
Were you afraid it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
“I thought I had made 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.”
Where did you get so much willpower to risk it that way?
In my position, I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was handled between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I knew I would never win as much as everyone else.
"In my first interview in 2005 I already noticed that they looked at me with caution.
Due to my training and also to my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares of Allianz won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
“This is like a snowball,” police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"While earning money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion because of it.
And how did they get to him?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to get 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech government signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes of which the Czech Republic can raise 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kronor).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will come out of seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kronor from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructures that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies for obtaining resources in business innovation.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the newly entered countries that use them the least.
Twenty-year sentence for former Nicaraguan president, court decrees
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday handed down a 20-year sentence for the country’s former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzlement of $100 billion (almost 1.8 billion kroner).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to be placed under house arrest in his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, will again be behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend rather on the penitentiary agents if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how Alemán was constantly transferring government money to a company account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, peacefully passed the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and budget item, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three defects that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of compulsory laws, called as expenditures of the rulers that are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
However, the biggest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, lies in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the taxes, fees and credits of the banks, often issued, without meaning, obligations with which they indebted disproportionately to their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy stocks and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts.
This was the ideal opportunity for his government to put the state’s finances in order.
Instead, however, the state continued to go into debt.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within global measures are least threatened by poverty.
That is why massive social programs are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been vainly swollen with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if the retirement age and pension reform do not change soon, then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, governing whoever governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who govern will become civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending on the presidents’ expenses.
The planned deficit of more than $70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not squandered what it could in the last ten years.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become only officials, so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, the peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will make possible the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight together against the crisis of the financial market.
The Monetary Marking will receive more than one hundred billion dollars through tenders.
In these tenders the banks auction the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to tender, and then another twenty-four billion dollars will be facilitated by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, namely the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report for customers.
“This coordinated action by central banks likely decreased the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks must really be afraid of what awaits them even when they decided to take this step,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
“It seems like the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems accessing loans and that they will have to lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow money even as the Central Banks of the US, Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the housing market in the United States.
Klaus: Environmentalists’ debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now arose with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
“The debates there are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "I often only find myself with the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now find out about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closing he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not so big and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
In addition, as a man experienced with totalitarianisms, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke of the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600 thousand people failed to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the date and for this reason they did not manage to change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid driver’s license.
According to traffic, the passport has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of card, the offices of the metropolis are full of applications and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates around 2,000 daily customers.
In the queues wait half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet been issued the new driver’s license.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their driving license and do not reach until the end of the year, but will go on the roads without a valid driving license will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the infraction with a warning.
In case of an administrative infraction the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to moderately impose fines of up to 1,000 kroner.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, the 1,000 kroner fines do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don’t want to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driver’s license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between the years 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence of Berdych's accomplice detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend between 13 and 10 years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided that the sentences should be reduced to one year and the second to two years.
The detectives of the Prague department against organized crime were going to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years old.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also indicted in this case but the verdict of the Court of First Instance awaits him in the first place.
In spite of this, in other cases he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement of 19 people in the robbery and the High Court today overturned 16 of them.
Most of the defendants' allegations were dismissed by the investigation as fabricated cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid punishments.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The prosecution refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
In terms of the theft, their victims suffered serious impacts on their health but they are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without gun permission.
At the home search, police found guns, ammunition with a steel core, a laser handler and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to Berdych’s case are still filing other lawsuits, and in some cases have yet to appear.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who for now have avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change a few children: 12 million
For changing children in the maternity ward, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million crowns of compensation from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, disagrees in principle with Veleba’s proposal.
"Such a demand we don't approve, it's too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
“In order for us to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterpart ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescisory value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>’s family wanted, for each month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the Motol Faculty Hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls, according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry, suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was best endured by the men although they struggled with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women are worse off with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba said.
Veronica and Nicola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> Maternity Home last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermákov<0xC3><0xBD>s in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
The governor of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, gave each family at the end of October 100,000 kroner as compensation for the mistake made at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital that the region manages.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask for help from the administrator.
The court to date has granted them a proportionately low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the Kingdom of Wallachia brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Provincial Court he was the first to use the trademark Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear for the oral hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the trial, Polívka's lawyer.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, to everyone comes the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea has also Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We’ve had about ten years of work.
Searching for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that therefore I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the trademark Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Polívka in her television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
Then it was not about orienting him towards the creation of a fictitious realm.
A few years later Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From this comic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> later created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use her name and signature on passports and even offered her holders discounts to visitors to her farm and attendees to her shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also ruled that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who dedicated themselves entirely to it.
The collaboration, among the now decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetin.
From that moment there began to be conflicts between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the eternally chosen".
The leading role in the kingdom, through Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>'s mediation, derived in the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an accusation against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which has been rejected by the court to this day.
Something clear could bring into the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The new king should come out of him.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We are not in a hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can show up," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I have never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is on the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I was complaining, for example, about the headboard space in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer in front of the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
Step inside quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value more the invention of design although the car already looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the 206 model, the lateral steering has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the body measures have grown.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned scarcity of space in the headboard.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
I must value this as very accessible (thanks to the folding back door) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav’s model, we find that the Peugeot is lagging behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when placing the stroller of the child its value is critical.
But if I had to comment something positive then I must quote the floor that is quite flat after pulling down the backrests of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's what a 1600 would look like if it belittled the familiar five-doorer.
It is quiet, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the <0xC5><0xA1>koda of that time which seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
Prices are responding
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 kroner, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headboards, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything from everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but count on the team’s add-ons on the Fabia and you’ll get to a fairly similar number.
It is now up to you to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
English schools are attended by children from Eastern European countries and therefore locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans so far only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record those cases where conflicts between emigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak emigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and brawls among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that police in Chatmam arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak migrant.
The girls cheered him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
“As we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to leave, he threw apples and pears at us, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his ass," he described another nasty incident to The Times, the Slovak student's mother.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with Eastern European emigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above, show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks registered who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is truly the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can come true, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
the palm trees and all included with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only in one island you find still much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the United States (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana tall buildings emerged, wide avenues ran cars that were a symbol of cult in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio left their signatures the stars of the entertainment world and politicians from all America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Abanense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you mix cocktails according to your desires.
And those cult cars of the 50s still work in Havana today, because those Lada and Fiat cars that arrived a long time ago have rusted between these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the area as there.
Other places metamorphose into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
Sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the sugar factories by narrow lanes in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for decades were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sister models that are in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned hacienda of Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, they should not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in limestone rock lands.
Mogotes, limestone rock pylons and rocks of steep elevations in the falls of the valley, and in its caves fertile lands are acclimated thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories you can find your final product.
Perhaps someone finds it interesting that there was filmed the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
A town of old abolengo that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is such a remote place that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road that united it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore, nothing was destroyed, because each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Ancon Beach or the valley of the sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
A small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it to be the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is already confirmed by the way.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was and that now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Santería, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, all of these could be filled with many pages.
However, as they say, it is better to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few troops and insufficient equipment are what are influencing the mission’s progress in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Minister Robert Gates, should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as expected, agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland)representatives of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week, through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to step up activity, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
“The development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next step is to make it possible for the population to start economic and security development on their own," Defense Minister Des Browne told BBC News.
The ninety percent
Afghan rebel activity, according to U.S. military data, is higher than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the Allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the attending countries in recent months, there has been controversy over whether all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For passive was criticized, for example, Germany.
“The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands for fighting there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a footage accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph of British troops playing a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach 1 trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to 842.7 billion kroner in September.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kroner.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the state budget's economic evolution.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on state debt at the beginning of October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state has been in debt with more than 111 million crowns.
“For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could cross the trillion kroner border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion kroner,” said iHNed.cz, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora: “We could spend the trillion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If the situation on the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don’t see such a change,” he added.
Doubt grows
State debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
State debt is repaid by means of treasury bonds, state bonds, direct credits or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s indebtedness grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
Foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion kroner since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter creates a 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is mostly generated from bonds where there is 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the state’s debt management and repayment strategy for 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion kroner.
In early December, the ministry lowered the plan by 152.8 billion kroner thanks to improved state budget developments.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum planned resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion kroner for pension payments, 43 billion kroner for financing state bonds and 1.8 billion kroner in payments from European investment bank loans.
I was comparing Khartoum in court today for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting students from 6 to 7 years old give the name of Mohammed to a teddy bear when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was liable to a lash.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher serving at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with attack on Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints by parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back in fact to the month of September, when this teacher asked her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of children’s mouths, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of 23 children have chosen Mohammed as their preferred name.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself - he himself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’s Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I’m sorry only that I asked the children to vote for a name”, it is according to him only an “innocent mistake”.
Opinion divided by numerous pupils of the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive to her pupils " and " that never speaks of religion in class " ..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we for example give it to a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the statute," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was "at stake," his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not anticipate violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "evident tensions exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday to Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on a pursuit of negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, the West considers independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favor.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden where these "negotiations of the last chance" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has expressed some of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered a compromise always feasible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of independence from the province.
Belgrade particularly feared a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
" For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible. "
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a right of veto.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush signs agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he met Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations with respect to the peace route they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority presided over by Abbas would seek "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues."
This denomination covers the three main problems of the disputed point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be “global and in-depth” and refer to all aspects of a settlement, quoting “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
On his return to the rostrum, Olmert pledged to make future negotiations "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set a deadline for the implementation of his " vision " of two coexisting Palestinian and Israeli states.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this regard on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As always in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspection générale de la police nationale française (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, rue Luisa-Miguel, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"He was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without rotating headlight," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, i.e. not authorized to drive on public roads " (read below) and driven by two young men without helmets, was circulating " at full throttle " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the give way to the right," the police said.
Alcohol control on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (the front unraveled, windshield cracked, bumper torn off) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of involuntary manslaughter and denial of assistance " to the IGPN, together with the departmental management of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor pointed out that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this minimoto bike arrived relatively quickly to his left ".
Yesterday, a type of groove, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the socks on the floor, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in the time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subjected to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing relief to both young men.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious misconduct " concerning this point.
"It's the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigation, which you have to be very cautious about," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that precisely leads to the scene.
“We went down right away, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them,” said this witness.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw “a policeman who was completely terrified, limping.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that people were present of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been driven by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, relief arrived “about twenty minutes after the police marches.”
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that the police services did not provide assistance to the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tensions Rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police cracked down on Monday on the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stones, injuring policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been detained.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday picked up support from the religious parties regrouping in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the waste to which they swore before Musharraf.”
" Musharraf's promise no longer fulfills "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the emergency measure proclaimed Saturday afternoon.
He had to rule in the coming days on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election to the presidential election on October 6, by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "does not value anymore" after the state of emergency was established, Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant information minister also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies are unforeseen.
This calculation takes into account unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is not foreseen, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception allowed, however, a better "fertility dominance", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 has gone from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple in five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of work in space to make the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky departure that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chopped" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday then that the astronauts had released from the shuttle Discovery the module Harmony, a thick cylindrical piece in charge of soon hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see picture).
This module is a type of landing platform for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module with 17.5 tons solar panels, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the reorganization of the module’s solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that’s where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordions, has been damaged by a little more than a meter or less by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment has been halted so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to make a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snail at the end of the 30-metre long remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Tall, sturdy, very skillful, has a highly developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this doctor of training has been in charge of "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After having precisely inspected the damage, he sectioned the faulty cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " who had stayed close to the airlock and, from the interior, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution on the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "scrambled" by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were taking advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock market
EADS shares are currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it will tend to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% at 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditions the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion euros for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any further encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS's operating result failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to delays in another programme, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Election of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, after the polls: the Russians are going to massively opt for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending voters a televised message about public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as the leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president didn’t let anything go by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference – his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident,” he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says there has never been “even in Yeltsin’s time” such a dirty election.
After last weekend’s crackdown on demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the Soviet homo mentality"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections lie two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for a third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in both legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," estimates sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikola<0xC3><0xAF> Kopossov, of the St. Petersburg State University, goes back further: civil society lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic easing,” estimates Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " renounce of their own accord the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved themselves after the outbreak of the USSR.
" Why reflect? "
The phenomenon touches all social strata, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old teacher: " Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen’s Nazi archives, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are openly accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not previously available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his rights-holders.
The eleven states in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow searches "particularly on the displacements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to the opening of these nominative documents to the public, owing to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or of the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the citizens deported or subjected to compulsory work and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Center on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral Indo-European trade already reach about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
The EU foreign ministers had last April given their approval to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The bilateral Indo-European trade already reaches about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will greatly boost both economies" and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services ", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, feeling that the bilateral trade minister " has not yet reached the presence of the European Union and the European Union".

Bank of England takes note of concerns offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to ease the current turn of worries over credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer at the 5.75% base rate in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market as well on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time that the bank England BoE puts liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is " prepared to take further steps to keep interbank lending indices " up-to-date in line with its base index.
The daily interbank index was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month index was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumours, supported by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny examination of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a dismissal of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the increase of 50% of the bonus for employment, the re-establishment of the TIPP (internal rate for oil products) floating, a check-transport or the restrictions of rentals.
Since UMP and NC have voted against examining the articles (180 votes to 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that resulted in exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of PS MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more and no less, the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival would take place August 8-10 on a private 500-acre farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, Republic Festival Director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Latitude Henham Park Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been in charge of the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now host up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" I've ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's work together to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as the market and were working with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level politics because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional venue that lately tends to take place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in Chicago’s Grant Park, after breaking out of the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours is more about urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of country festival in the European and urban in the American way. "
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but states " that they are interesting enough to allow investing in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life. "
Charlie Jones says the festival’s hotel offer is “very large,” like the 80,000-strong Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been thrown at the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His fellow C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood moviegoers to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to compete with the Governor?
“You have to be cautious, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If you find that conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are going to judge the best,” he says.
The Race to Festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nonetheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race for the Oskars has begun.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give them value and ensure that filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness got a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on Santa Monica’s billboard and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
With less than five weeks to go until the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to occur.
Banif believes that “from a statistical point of view, December on the stock market tends to be a positive month.
However, forecasts should not be based solely on statistics, especially because in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not supporters of the stock market catching a run in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, ready to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight towards quality values both in the long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulus from inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not a good time to venture into saying that there will be a rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since its peaks on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative outlook.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert specifies that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, says that we are close to technical levels and "we could therefore see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the United States in terms of the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be responsible for taking the Ibex to new highs.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year is about great values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some construction companies "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the rises will come from the hands of the banking and the industrial sector.
The builders will also benefit from this rally, should they fail.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow suit,” he said.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the holiday sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technology will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a bearish month.
The real end-of-year rally was in 2003, when the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rise of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex rises 8.36% since January) and if it can count on its end of year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
In the meantime, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening one afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the experience of Popular will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that supports the hours of the shops.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, freelancers and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not represent a great investment, although if a greater recruitment of personnel, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía of Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very long hours, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises PopularMax will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to make competition to our customers," Rivero says.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've got it.'
With that phrase Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the close of the market, when he found that the channel he directs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
"Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'it's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've fallen less'," he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we've fallen less'.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain puts its loss in what we have been doing this year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday gave up 1.52% and accumulates a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (Five Days publisher) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we monetize it in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network this year to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising.
If this announced figure becomes real, the television network would register this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to the 965.4 million of the 2006 financial year.
For its part, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while the net revenues of television grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent Mediaset.
“We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, which we have already valued with 33% of Endemol.’
According to analysts, the market is showing some tiredness at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently cut its earnings estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to a reduction in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered the profit forecast of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

1 .
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities based mainly on their high dividend yield and sustainable long-term potential.
2 .
Caja Madrid: it sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (maintain) because of the 'multiples attractiveness' and the rise of the business.
3 .
JPMorgan recommends underweighting in both cases as it has 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
The Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force November 1
Parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by Congress of the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of having both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to guarantee the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The MIFID, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, while reinforcing investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and encouraging cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new rules will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialised firms and to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (FIAs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose in the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they make, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Economics Committee of Congress, several modifications were incorporated, among which it is worth noting that securitised debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of U.S. high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally define the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can perform 30 years after the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was approved in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work as an employee, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer acquisition services to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised CPI rises five tenths in November, to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an overview of how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The forward indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that employed for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
“The CPI will remain at relatively high levels.”
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes pointed out in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged regarding the figure advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion over three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen more than 50 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it was amassing record deposits of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the distrust of its customers and despite the 100% guarantee of that money offered by the government and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the bank to its financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to capture about a quarter of the revenue in British banks that are deposited over the next three years to get the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18bn to reach the <0xC2><0xA3>30bn target.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin consortium’s offer, in which three other companies are involved, as its favorite to rescue it from bankruptcy.
The Mayor of Totana Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested today in the early morning the current mayor of the municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the police chief of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then councilor of the municipality, and that according to sources of the investigation consulted by the SER chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The agents continue to search the municipal units and the council of Urbanism and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As reported yesterday by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore crowded, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are detained.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the PSOE list for Toledo for the next general elections and be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to stand for the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change at the university level.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he has pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he takes office, Bono hopes to turn the House into “the house of respect and not of insult or shouting” and make it “look more and more like the citizens.”
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly and quietly is the Congress, the President of the Government on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
Likewise, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotency".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change subjects both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles to merciless persecution, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement that is president of the Government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach forces him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his government has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the breach, in which sectors it has occurred and why your government, that of the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
In addition, it requires him to explain with maximum clarity to the Spaniards what are the measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have been and will be no such explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the gasoline penny suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is to say, that it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with slogans empty of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that lord so useful for electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
Provided that it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not intend us to ride a bicycle or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has detained the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation reported today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose offices he is at the moment along with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Department of Urbanism and the municipal company of management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not detained but are charged in the summary, which is instructed by the Court number 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have now been placed at the disposal of the courts.
According to the sources, the former councilor of Totana and now autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as well as the current girlfriend of the former councilor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the Group, through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then arrested in Totana, namely the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks on the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (incidentally at the head of the PISA report on education in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy signature has leaped into public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Councillor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of crimes on Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs in the store worth less than 400 euros, it is considered simply a foul (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to 1,000 euros, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than that imposed on discharge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than the discharge (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel is punishable by a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would be punishable by a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the authors ' authorization is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's getting a long hand.

My GP gives me one of his rare research papers titled, “Money Produces Brain Activations, Especially If Others Get Less.”
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and their partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if when both were right they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecution of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosniaks were killed -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on that list from which the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach’s documentary, ‘La lista de Carla’ (2006, not released in Spain) takes its title, which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance is right for me?
Auto insurance, which covers the driver against possible claims, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the right car.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which states that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the more likely you are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
It is for this reason that both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower accident rate due to their prudence.
Also, using the counts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it the probability of having some type of mishap.
Increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 have several drawbacks when it comes to taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and seniority of the license.
Although the ideal to be well insured is full-risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk with franchise, so that they get the coverages of an all-risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would mean that the customer pays a part of the amount of the loss.
"The portion of the amount of the claim that the customer provides will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, top manager in Spain of First Europa, online insurance broker.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, but not to those caused in their own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
One piece of advice.
If you are under 25, try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base rate.
“The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the company’s profit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses," Noguera explains.
After the age of 25, drivers have it easier when hiring insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most advisable is to contract an all-risk franchise.
"Normally young people can not make use of the experience previously acquired when relying on an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'novice fear' has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children it is preferable that he negotiates full-risk insurance, as long as his economic situation allows it, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest rate of accidents, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with a franchise (may be 300 euros), or, when a high bonus level is available, an extended third-party from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They have a more relaxed drive and a greater purchasing power to afford to take on a larger amount of franchise,” said Luis Noguera.
For retirees, it is advisable to have an all-risk insurance with a franchise (this being 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver against possible claims, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic are looking for a point worth eighths in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the missing point to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to decide their classification.
The Italians add ten points and have already certified on the fifth day their pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that the Shakhtar, with six, and who receives Benfica, who has four, does not overtake him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth matchday, as Milan have to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where they debut on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place for the final on the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to come out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and ensure a better cross in the eighths.
The whole of Gordon Strachan could even serve a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar does not win, but can not be trusted because at nine-point tie the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct match.
Thus, the Milaners will try to bitter the night to the Scots, who are confident to get into the eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were defeated in that round last season with a goal of Kaka in the extra time (1-0) after the 0-0 of the first leg.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the victory, in the event that he loses Celtic, both to get into the eighth and to continue in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the top European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver's GM Place stadium that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out tickets to watch the concert that included a video recounting the story of the group that made furor in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects his main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five Spice Girls took to the stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd at GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had banned him days earlier.
In a statement, Beckham said the British star "hasn't seen our locker room at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice', whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" caused the quintet to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m glad I made the decision,” Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been fixed and we all love each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies awaited them.
Among the five, there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will perform on December 23.
New fears over gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia’s export of the fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
An earlier dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge Ukraine more, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more for imports from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly pushed up prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Central Asian Soviet nations.
NHS 'must test foreign workers'
The Scottish NHS needs to check the criminal records of employees outside of Europe, a vigilante said.
Auditor General Robert Black’s recommendation came after a foreign doctor was found to be linked to the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of how much foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed to other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European Economic Area in the wake of the Glasgow airport attacks.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after colliding with a jeep at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in the United Kingdom.
The NHS hopes to conduct pre-employment checks on candidates, to make sure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scotland Health Board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to conduct criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The auditor general’s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside of Britain.
"Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available on the number of foreign NHS personnel."
BMA Scotland President Dr Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment check-ups work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say there are currently 1,161 foreign nationals, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general cautioned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the checking procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the pre-employment policy and guidance for foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was of great interest that this work was carried out in the wake of the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates at film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division’s late vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for Best Picture.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal."
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film, which features soundtracks by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was produced at just <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s two-time award-winning album Joshua Tree, also won – for best director and best debut director.
Rock music was at the center of another awardee at the ceremony - as Julien Temple's film about The Clash lead singer Joe Strummer, won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in London, in David Cronenberg's film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named after Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia has arrested 208 terrorist cell militants who planned an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television of the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning the smuggling of missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia has created a 35,000-strong force to protect the Abqaiq facility, the world’s largest oil plant, following a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile launcher expert” who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned the smuggling of eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining al-Qaeda as militants to fight allied forces and backing the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants target many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants — recruited by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-Western government — targeted residences of foreign government associates, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person “media cell” in Medina, whose goal was to promote “takfiri thinking” — the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus's climate may give an idea of the Earth's future
Venus may once have been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a snapshot of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."
Police seize "enriched uranium"
One kilo of radioactive material, which they say is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but he said it could have been sold for $1 million.
It's still open
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy for presidential candidates to answer a snow monkey's questions.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions put forward on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the Republican Party debate on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party ahead of next year’s election.
It is unclear exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: Broadcasters noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest word exchanges of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been at the forefront of crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney’s reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, came to terms with the issue.
Neither has the floor to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both alerted on the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of China’s toxic toys and other concerns about the outside world, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if candidates believed every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble toward the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now, against all odds, first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too intelligent to be a candidate in the election.
The race is unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is on the rise in Iowa, coinciding with the fundraising campaigns of Liberal Ron Paul, and his heated remarks from Wednesday’s debate.
They both came out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the match is divided and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Laborista
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but it still emerges.
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They don’t seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel bills in Paris, nor extramarital finger sucking.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) British Labour government party for nearly four years using fake names, and that the party did not report him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister evaded calling for an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by stating that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with growing wit, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The bailout of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poverty of judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative mess.
A trio of retired generals began a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it is the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably toward the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it’s clear that the prime minister can’t make things better, that he doesn’t have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press looks for bad news; and the government gets on the defensive and doesn’t focus.
On one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although he wanted to renounce Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the registration authority tax, are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the treasury.
And even though it’s not directly involved in Blairish’s setbacks — or “partner cash,” research into political party funding — voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has anyone been directly scammed.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision is not made by him.
The anti-anonymity laws for big political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham’s deal, and that it was not illegal, will obviously confront Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraiser chief who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these proceedings, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to convict his party for breaking the law, but is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter — led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as find a permanent and independent head for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, as he has not had one in six months, and he must also push for genuine reform of party financing.
This will require hard labor cooperative work with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the unions—bitter measures for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he has to deal with some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and strong competition.
Sharks Cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the U.S. credit card market?
When there’s blood in the water, it’s natural for dorsal fins to swim around excitedly.
Now that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million charge in its U.S. consumer finance business, in part because of weak card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, the third quarter crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American People’s Bankruptcy Act (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a major loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, defaults) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25 percent higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at cash flow than active securities, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
They can even work to outperform the issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue repaying the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card debt rises on the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders face by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid asset downgrade.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, head of finance at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit contraction pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers convicted in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility in the frauds with Enron’s former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent on seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a notorious cause in Britain for the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the sluggish end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the bankers were charged with alerting Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - he dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a myriad of frauds at Enron, which helped its downward spiral into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary’s interest at zero, but the three Britons knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper's control bought the bank's interest in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in interest on the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million were left in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two counts of conspiracy in the Enron collapse.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting trickery, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses appear successful.
The collapse caused the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were indicted last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the wealthy Russians.
“It has a capacity of up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Gulfstream’s representative.
“But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire’s Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had set up their exhibition stands, hoping to lure new wealthy Russians into all kinds of products, from mahogany cobbled yachts to diamond-embedded car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a shiny orange Porsche on the booth next to his.
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and chalk compared to us," he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to gather in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s biggest consumers and spenders.”
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree wealthy include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think-tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweller.
She attends the fair for the first time together with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
“Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in an afternoon suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit she wore as a red carpet dishing veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cutters, Mövenpick ice creams, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of Dutch royal Delft porcelain, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, salespeople said the wealthiest Russians of all time (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade show.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, emissaries of the millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress sets of $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000, to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said it had sold three chain-armband-shaped car grills for Rolls Royce Phantom for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded with Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconia cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,” says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase “Russian billionaire” does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with stacks of counterfeit one-million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s chief marketing officer, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors would stop to shake up piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their phones while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
'Stupid' Surgery Could Cause Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the "A Little Healthier" restaurant and saw an ambulance climb up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
“Then I saw the ambulance come up,” Mr. Livingston, the restaurant’s supervisor, said Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone was dead."
Authorities learned that the woman killed was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue house.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting for the toxicology test, although the results will not be available until a few weeks, which will help solve the mysterious death that has grieved the upper ranks of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy said of Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and who left two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the house arrived around 3 p.m.
On November 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
It has been more than a week and authorities have said little about his investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say whether Mrs Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door in Mrs. Castro’s home, where a withered rosebush is located in the front of the house, and a Dalmatian barks in the back.
A blue drum labeled “vanilline ethyl” – used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes – was at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rugged political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch out with this one or that one,’” she said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock market.
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which rose with reassuring remarks from the U.S. central bank’s vice president.
Stocks loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two in reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, said policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to continued financial market tensions.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turmoil was “partly reversed by the market improvement at the end of September and during October.”
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments to financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, as home sales hit the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a notice from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total labor force, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, at the close to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at the close to 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s top companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, it highlighted the resurgence of credit tension in the markets after a strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained credit and rates of the three-month “Libor” loans among British banks, signifying the biggest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England Takes Judgment of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara’s Lawsuits
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important compared to the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the national team that is on loan- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and further because the desk of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part-time one.
Whoever fails to get sixth place will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than for ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or “Tubby” Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, had been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricketer, unless he is given the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a big influence on decisions, but so do they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time taking a "wicket" and a hitter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example James Anderson, who plays surely in the first round even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races each to win one place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their highs and can expect more of these.
The games of Shah or Bopara at the Asgiriya stadium may only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a player of importance, and despite scoring a hundred double against Australia in Australia, can still be underestimated.
Chances are that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion at today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over young Bopara’s exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah’s favor is his brilliant and valuable early 88 debut test in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class versus only 6 of Bopara, who, by 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent anti-spin bowling records.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two turns in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next encounter, he seemed to have taken from his "batting" some elan than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team is happy to live on swords.
He catches on for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he overturned his vehicle at an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at the distance, to say excitedly, “See that?”
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his moves that seem to satisfy him, as he hits with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work – and to Fight Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who ran out of cash, no visa extensions and those hoping the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and what is safe now.”
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to stop.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with her two children because it was impossible to renew her visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in her country.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped pull Al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues.”
“That’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were drawn to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops secured groups of “concerned citizens,” armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned because of visa denials and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on visas for refugees to force people back.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni said.
“I can’t believe a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shia areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will resurface sectarian tensions and start fighting.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only an educational field.
“Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sardinian that we are not French” – that was the ironic motto about themselves from the smallest federal state for their fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the educational system of the Saar which in a study of the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took the fifth place.
In this way, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students coming from the Saarland is above average in high schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
"The system of vocational education is being exploited in the Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economy (IW).
More than five out of five young people graduate from the Vocational School, so it turns out that the Saarland is 7 points above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of the Saarland forced higher schools to make more publicity for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools,” a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education said.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence across the country.
In order for the children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, there is no cost. In the meantime, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with upcoming studies will show whether student performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of backward students in school development declined from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students can calculate better.
To the displeasure of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, although they could achieve good results in this field.
Although the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in secondary schools.
Chavez is changing the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez lets the time change in the South American country by delaying the clock by half an hour.
Currently Chavez is looking like a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will pass at least four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States once imposed the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the breaking of relations with his neighbor Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would have no relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia.
“My dignity doesn’t allow me to do that,” says Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the country’s citizens must decide in a referendum on Sunday.
This reform could greatly expand their power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the decision made by Uribe to withdraw Chávez’s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of the hostages.
Chavez said Sunday that the decision made by Uribe has offended Venezuela.
There is also much talk about Chavez in Spain.
A new ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?", is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts present a plethora of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault of that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the stretching of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research of Economic Cycles told the "Bild" newspaper.
The new unemployment insurance charges may also be for employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from one year to the next is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the labor office does not have to get into an unpleasant situation again, asking for loans and subsidies from the Federal State, in the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday, it became public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached its highest level in 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of Earth.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that had not been proposed so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers had suspected that lightning could exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays shut down from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles tells the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous Urey-Miller model of the origin of life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it’s not like that: if there was ever life there, that would have to be in one of the earliest states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and temperatures of 500°C reign on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
“Possibly, Venus is a ‘diabolical’ twin of Earth, but it’s still a twin,” Russell said.
The main goal of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth in mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature", in the opinion of the researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more common features with Earth than we had assumed," ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, the researchers discovered in the south polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the upper atmospheric layers of the Earth’s poles, as described by a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet also called the Dawn Star or Evening Star orbits the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not closely resemble Earth, scientists assume that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On both planets water had agglomerated that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it was dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany’s reputation and so demanded that the grand coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the "Handelsblatt" newspaper.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute validity for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, underlines the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received in carrying out a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of the Dalai Lama and because of it was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to news sources of the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded that Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the Tibetans’ religious leader in his official position.
The Dalai Lama’s actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shootings, burning of cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from taking to the streets.
Barricades were made, vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister of Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We also need to make sure that our country’s social problems do not take the violent form.”
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hanover.
Not all young people are involved in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits."
It is still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young men starred in serious riots in the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of an imitative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, actions are necessary.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
More vocational training posts need to be ensured.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great social control in the families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says: "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to "give young people the opportunity to get a job or vocational training sooner".
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a helicopter with beacons flew over the territory.
Authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of almost 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that police will take rigorous measures until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday about 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, in which two young people were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the young men was not the fault of the police.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more is to be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor actually live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach made to her for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy activities, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial way and so showed made it clear that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House, it was very clearly stated to everyone that such a reproach was appropriate.
There could be no interest or feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high politics that flees in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions taken at Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these climate goals should be realized here.
In general, this way of praising herself—for two years, the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
He uses expressions to get an impulse to the people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going by the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the inner problems are appearances of little value.
Poverty of children and worries about low-wage workers?
The only thing he does is talk about that topic using subordinate sentences.
It’s amazing how many times you’re wrong to talk when it comes to the supplement for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in unknown territory", when it came to more concrete information.
The attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate over YouTube’s Republican presidential candidates and must now fear only one candidate from the outside.
From the outset, tensions between the candidates have emerged.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for making New York a "shelter for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani responded to the former Massachusetts governor by saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers. "I would like to say that his own house was a 'port' for the illegals."
Candidates tend to attack: as the Republican group has no clear favorite so far, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were uploaded to YouTube, also don’t have much content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," was John McCain's rebuke of his opponent Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from Vietnam war veterans, when he refuses to recognize as torture "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg, Florida show that meanwhile the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded loudly when they praised conservative values and denied tax hikes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, apologizing to people and the television audience for being an advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, the president of Pakistan, was sworn in for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he took power with a bloodless military coup, the former general first rules the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the attorney general of the state, after the oath Musharraf will very soon annul the state of emergency and will fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since the state of emergency was proclaimed in the Supreme Court, there have been many lawyers who support Musharraf, and last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new election of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written in the best era of the band.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of them their box, their cables and above all their buttons.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius, 63, dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with its sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock’s fans was the fact that the band Harmonia was making music again.
What we have to rebel against here is this: the questions accurately have shown that the name of the band rumbled in the minds of the people, but it was not something so special that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the misconception Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a music award "Echo" to the members of the band Can 2003 from Cologne for their work of life, in the hall you could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths with amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times did not achieve a great effect on the audience, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Already some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a time, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of Cluster into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
It was an artist’s life full of surprises.
One day, they say, an Ottenstein Harmonia singing association banner appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Even though the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording participated almost 50 people.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against custom.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up getting involved in issues of esotericism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself the goal of cultivating this own German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius' work, the Neu! band was again discovered.
The performance of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all Krautrock influences to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno’s line, accompanied by special music, fills the room: “This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in black and white photo projections, where instruments with wires are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing more than fix the microphones to the organ and the drums so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Today, electronic music is what it was meant to be.
Three people who dig deeper into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere you cough, you whisper and in a good moment of emphasis you sing "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
It was never rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia remains calm.
The stage reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
That can break one’s nerves or give one quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are once again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two were not very convinced.
Either the concepts get too focused on actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" cannot help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the mountain of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the prettiest man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to watch perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he chases" (Why nowadays movie titles have to be so long and crazy?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life have already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decadence retained until now most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a nutshell: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm Fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard on two charges), the story about American reporters in the war who leave to spot a war criminal Serb named “fox,” could probably be a new “Apocalypse Now.”
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and each time it turns out to be a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first we are introduced to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also envisions a love affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who will be killed later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters of the world, which was to capture the war criminal and leave them to the Bosnian Muslims to take revenge in a fair way.
It’s so bad, it makes you want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in reality, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really worried about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes up with a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is about a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad".
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It’s almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arguette, “Across All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Bloody Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all of these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It has to be at least decades before Hollywood rolls a good film about the holocaust having as an example the movie "Schindler's List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the Vietnam War plays "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because screenwriters have no qualms (which is necessary to be able) about telling good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn’t know how bad the Nazi regime actually was.
Maybe you don’t have to be a good person to make a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look at an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change."
The big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives as a response the negative criticism about the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and economics for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that one must be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, general director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday that the resignation was "not good for the economic location".
Lately, no other project in the big city has fostered so much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal, the political, sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but it is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust says on WELT ONLINE.
It referred to the Sportbund’s expected decision in early December on Munich’s application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance."
“This dream did not end forever,” said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut’s remarks.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
“It’s too soon to let the opportunity be taken away, if at this point the plans are ruined,” HSB director Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A resignation of the application contradicts the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Federation of Higher School Sports (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for 2015 Universities not as a "substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sport Federation of Higher Schools named Hamburg as an application candidate.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate for not taking advantage of the valuable time spent building houses in Hamburg.
“For many years the Senate was delaying the development of the small district of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses,” said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the little Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg’s application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Isn't that so?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Shine-Boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" cast doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brilliance-Boxes, the Moderna Museet museum in Stockholm conducted internal research and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brightness-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén also gifted to the museum Moderna Museet, are "false one hundred of the international market", and almost one hundred of them.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Bright-Boxes", he painted the wooden boxes in red, blue and white, with the same sample that had cartons of soap powder "Bright".
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his works of 1968 in the Moderna Museet museum were exhibited hundreds of Shine-cardboard boxes. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
These were not works of art, but exemplars (which were only objects) on display.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a Gloss-wooden boxes, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auction some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the chief curator of the Moderna Museet museum, investigated six Bright Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First their tight silvers were printed and grinded and then painted in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the year 1990 shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silvers. In addition, it is not about oil painting, but about acrylic painting.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol’s official Brilliance-Boxes list,” says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet museum and adds that if The Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York does not come to any conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as the exhibition copies/objects.”
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" that these are soap powder boxes.
But from that moment there everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
The leader Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
The soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been barricading themselves in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit himself with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military policemen who were to watch him had passed into his ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blockaded the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Advisor, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
“People are fed up,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to come into our ranks.”
Gen. Danilo Lim, who formerly led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said the other military troops soon wanted to follow the march.
Major government critics called for a major demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months his government has been criticized for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups in the Philippines against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for a share is 14.46 euros.
It holds only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was much speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options for further increasing the financial part at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entering the business, after the bank Brendenberg increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution holds equity securities for a third-party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day involved with almost 10 by hundreds the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillich in the capital increase measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares with a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on DSL-products marketing cooperations.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” said a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, they make 18.49 per hundred of Freenet participate.
That meant that both companies kept all options, especially participation in the Freenet corporation.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now the holding of United Internet and Drillich had directly 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch is going to achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
