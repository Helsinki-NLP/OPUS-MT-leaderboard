At the end of the exchange, the Prague Stock Exchange fell into the negative
After the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Trades with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trades.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with its fall of the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
The market reaction to the outcome of the US House of Representatives vote, which refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilization plan, is thus perceptible here as well.
Fall of shares in Asia
The Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices managed, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange were losing more than five percent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“The hesitation about the U.S. bailout will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries would be affected.
The bloodbath of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (nearly K<0xC4><0x8D> 12 trillion).
The legislators thus deny the call for support for President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday and the main stock indices experienced the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones lost nearly seven percent, having seen a fall of this magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it emerged that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Gives Up: U.S. Government Can Inject $700 Billion In Banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a turning point in talks on adopting a bailout in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
However, success is not certain.
Indeed, before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulation Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to a vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout plan will be adopted is expected to be a first major psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, a "disillusionment" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on what form the market stabilization package should take,” Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be carried out as early as Sunday.
On Saturday night, representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
It should buy back unsold real estate assets from financial corporations that cause financial firms considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still have to pursue this market recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on falling equity markets.
According to Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, lawmakers are making sure Congress reaches a final deal as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the congressional decision could affect trading on Monday.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two Houses of Congress will vote, or whether the negotiations will not be blocked at the last moment by this or that problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still be subject to many changes.
The total amount earmarked for aid to the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the option of blocking the allocation of the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress has the option of putting him in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed with the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Sen. Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
Speaker Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of Golden Parachutes
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on accountability for the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the relief agreement, the unfolding of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for limiting such golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and made significant progress towards a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for property owners, who have problems paying for it.
The government should negotiate new installments for mortgages it will buy back, while reducing debtors' monthly payments and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Aid
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization is going to be very difficult.
“And that’s because we don’t know what the mechanism and price of the problem assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on loss-sharing between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not so important.
“It’s much more important that Congressmen agree this week to support this plan and that they will enshrine it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," Marek stressed.
An extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We will advise you, how to choose
While almost all mobile phones can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house an expensive high-end gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl records, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are stacked vinyl records on your shelves, with art rock, jazz or blues, you at least probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music on the move, i.e. compressed music, to put it simply - MP3 music.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for a reader, in the same way a Pink Floyd fan would struggle to bear headphones bought for twenty kroner at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also crucial.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions unknown, of course, to most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and SMS, it is able to play music and movies, record them, has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator can grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the shorter the interval between reloads.
And music playback is one of the most important energy spurts.
Few mobile phones are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, music players (especially the most rudimentary ones) are much better performers.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count on them to play music only for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second charger for work - this is true even for more expensive devices.
Problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, as a result of recharging, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the less performing.
Another problem arises when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do so without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
As for the drives, you do not need, except for the exception (iPod), any software.
It is enough to fill, through the USB connector, the music device coming from the computer.
Most mobile phones and players will create a media library themselves, sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or according to the user's judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, similar to the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a specific device, pay particular attention to the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile that plays MP3.
Virtually all mobile phones are capable of this.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
Everyone can play MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have precisely this format.
It is one of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
All you have to do is visit the corresponding web pages of the operator (or of another provider) on your mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to fast-made radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, the internet, or even the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on them.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which virtually all mobile phones have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, one can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also equipped with an input for ordinary earphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Truly anyone can ensure the order of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (the M2 type, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand kroner.
But be careful.
The basic models support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive get away with it even with 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1,100 kroner.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile-walkmans instead (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of the control comes close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the farthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the aforementioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned many times on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
As a result of the European Commission's recent steps in regulating roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly stated that in Czech Republic there is no room for another operator, choired with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network does not seem to have much luck anymore (in fact, now it would be difficult to find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable fall in prices, to which, subsequently, the conventional operators also had to react.
Yet even before troublemakers such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to the ones we hear today were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
We should add that behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which among others owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
This is how in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers text messages in Britain at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work also at home.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, at any rate, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of corporate customers, has not hidden, for a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
The future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
“At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with others very specific.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of Telefonika O2's press department, in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
“It is practically excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited time frame, we should have a concrete agreement now."
Instead, Vodafone is focusing on fulfilling requests for its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of shared fees and infrastructure.
This is what, in our opinion, means the most input from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to discover a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in step with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profit.
So what is the point of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to get along like thieves in fairs. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, when the U:fon was created, was exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s web pages.
Nowadays, the U:fon lends itself as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová remarked on this: "Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not only the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power in the Czech Republic to intervene in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached for the time being, as the offer from potential stakeholders has not been of sufficient interest to conventional operators," Kristián Chalupa of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS External Relations Department said in response to our question.
A statement made in this way would not come as a surprise on the part of representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an Office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially since Kristián Chalupa adds: "Overseas, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a drop in the prices of mobile phone services."
However, putting pressure on the market to function honestly and to lower prices does not seem to be in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which flows from their reactions.
The question, whether this is really a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all gas stations is probably due to the random and hard fight of the competition.
"The Office has not identified any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and consequently no operator has an increased corresponding responsibility for its behaviour in the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecoms regulator," Chaloupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Dropping responsibility on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in communications, whereby the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted Telecommunications Act did not include an expansion of the powers of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know this very well, but their interests seem to lie elsewhere.
When no one's watching, it can work
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, but these are only partly public.
In most cases, it is about companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer customized mobile telephone services.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company made in front of the operator figure of a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special (and other) price offers.
What is problematic is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
“If what you are talking about happens, it could be a violation of the contractual terms that we would be looking at and that could result in a cessation of collaboration with the company in question,” Martina Kemrová replied to our question regarding this issue.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has not reached those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, has ruled against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible profits, and, at the same time, as opposed to the real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the same way as ordinary customers of mobile operators.
Now, this is precisely what should seem strange to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question arises at the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, the conventional operators made an effort, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, if not too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in the developed countries have intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators but those of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies deal with this issue in the manner of a hot potato from which one gets rid by passing it on to a nearby target.
Following the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But let's not throw the handle after the beating.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at us, the Czech mobile market may be back in motion.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will only be able to remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo singing, a chorus and an instrumental version.
The song was performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek wrote the arrangements for the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful anthems.
As he had previously entrusted to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to make sure that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that we understood the lyrics well, that they sang simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first sounded in 1834 on the stage of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kermesse des savetiers), a Czech original play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
Prague's public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip in its ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be inscribed in the history of Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Agency) as the date when the first passengers will get on the metro, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pockets.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it registered on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Ludra<0xC5><0xBE>ílis, Radra<0xC5><0xBE>í<0xC5><0xBE> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, Rond<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the coupons online on the web pages of Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store may permanently forget the counters in the subway stations, where they had until now to trample with impatience in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon through the internet and it will be registered on their Opencard in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points of contact, there is a ticket office with trained staff at the disposal of passengers, which will help those interested with the purchase via the internet and, in addition, will record the coupon they have purchased on their card," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesman for the project.
Alongside the libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind the composting machines of the tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
An automaton will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
Namely in the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ská integrovaná doprava (Prague Integrated Transport), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of tickets Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of public transport in Prague.
The peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the indicated place on the side of the checkout.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the peri-urban buses and will not remember the date when the validity of their coupon expires, can rejoin the vending machines, initially used to record the coupons on the card.
This is where the information about the validity of their document will be displayed on the device screen.
Sudetenland calls for a referendum in the United States
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna (The Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This stems from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna.
Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov asked in the letter the US president not to allow "<0xC5><0xA1>umavská <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (a region of forests south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation well and we want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” reads the letter, signed “People, to whom the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava is at heart.”
Since the rally to Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, irrespective attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take into his hands the protectorate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state alien to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has not contributed in any way to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million of the inhabitants," the letter said.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least foresee that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted to such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would obtain for the Sudetenland some kind of autonomy.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to learn Czech.
“They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would be of benefit to them,” says Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, movies, the internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also reflected in the campaign’s “bloody” slogan:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You do not think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
This should symbolize that one can pay for a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry drew inspiration from similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where one can commonly see images with drastic images of accident victims.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by the fact of saving time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks have to be reminded to the drivers," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, transport psychologist at Na Homolce hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
Signs indicating danger to drivers are already less effective, he said.
"When a static warning panel is installed, it will likely merge with the environment and drivers will not notice it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án said.
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli Provisional Government, declared himself in favour of the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert said.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be made," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
“He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not desire that tractors and bulldozers crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said later.
Retreat of the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed support for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was a prerequisite for a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is forbidden
In the context of the tragic crash of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move inside the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old stewardess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the path of the coach.
The girl was sadly sitting next to the driver, in the most dangerous seat in the vehicle, although she had two more seats at her disposal.
However, the coach can have an accident, or even brake abruptly, also at the time when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under its data sheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing seating equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Student Agency long-distance coaches do not have standing seats; this was confirmed at Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by the company director Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This is an issue that we have dealt with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet during the journey as long as they had their own seat,” he said.
The law ignores the steward
“There is no unequivocal legal interpretation of the role of steward – no legal prescription deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The road transport law knows only the term "vehicle receiver"; it does not define his rights and duties," Hanzelka adds more ambiguously.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the director of the road traffic department, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the problem.
"It all depends on whether the bus has permission to offer standing seats in its approval.
It's all in there," he said.
The coaches are divided into urban, where there are standing seats and a limited maximum speed, intercity with standing seats and a higher allowed speed and in long distance coaches without standing seat with the highest allowed maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, an expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Neither is it certain when turbulence will occur and the air hostess may hit her head."
“In the event that the bus braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal prescriptions," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer stewardship services.
He's hiring two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their job as a risky job.
"However, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky trade, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on boarding.
It would also reduce costs," he said.
The safety concern is the reason for the absence of stewards in his vehicles the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses. We have opposed them from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz a year ago.
A huge tragedy has happened
A young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a flasher and blocked the way to the bus.
The latter's driver tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he brushed it on his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the family of the girl, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but as for the financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the movements of the stewards on board the bus.
"But it has not come to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not interested in buses, but rather in the points system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," says Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not see the activity of the stewards as something that would fundamentally jeopardize the safety of passengers," concludes spokesman Hanzelka, noting that the control of the safety of the buses is under the power of the police and the office for occupational safety.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
There was no shortage of words in the letter sent by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institute with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be constituted, according to the letter released Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "block of competence" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive starting point for further concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the injured WestLB is always under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in the search for a future solution.
For some time now, however, there has been talk - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between Deka Bank, which knows the clients of the Sparkasse through their investment funds, and the WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank, Franz Waas, made it clear during the presentation of the figures for the half-year at the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the Länder banks and savings banks, has instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with the WestLB on joint commercial activities.
This could be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have only just begun, it is said in the financial centre.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which counts 3,000 employees as one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial centre, has been involved in the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a time that Deta-Bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate bank and Halbab.
However, nothing emerged from this ternary bouquet.
As soon as the plans were made public, the government of the Land of Hesse decided against any participation of the Hellaba in them.
Afterwards, the other two houses also did not meet.
The Rhineland-Palatinate bank was replaced by the Baden-Wuttenberg bank in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the merger of the Deka-Bank with banks in the Länder.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, chairman of Hellaba’s board of directors, had spoken out against any commercial strategy for merging with its bank.
In spite of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Land Parliament has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Baden-Wuttenberg Land Bank could come to fruition first.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for further mergers were to increase, the potential partners would gradually escape.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has hitherto withstood the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringia Savings and Transfer Group, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, locked up any union with the WestLB earlier this year.
The NordLB would remain strictly.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of which business model the future capacity of the Länder banks should be secured had not been resolved by the German Savings and Transfer Group so far.
Eventually, a scrapping of the WestLb could take place, scrapping which is obviously not desired here.
This is also mentioned in the letter of the Board of Directors in place: in any case, a <0x60>comprehensive solution' for the institution would be sought.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the weekend of the Italians.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-litre barrel of Kaiser beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses him.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nueva station, four buses leave tonight at 23:45, <0x60>destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses traveling Brazilians exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, Marco Guarda explains, it's not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with faux fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For the past five years, they have been going to the beer party, already three tours this year alone.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking group manager - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive in the night on the Autostrada direction <0x60>Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus, travelers sleep.
It's better that way, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates will again take a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six and a half as planned in the parking lot near the Thérèse Square, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, dress up with a yellow cap.
Above it is written on the left <0x60>Fête de la bière', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency <0x60>conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
"When the doors of the beer tent open, we run," cries Marco in the early morning.
<0x60>Run!' Run and reserve seats at the bottom of the tent.
<0x60>Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to distribute them in the room!'
The mug, cries Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the locker!
<0x60>Show the security guards that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: <0x60>Tonight, I came back here at ten and a half o'clock!'
And that's it, it's off to the beer party.
Along the way, someone ties yellow caps to the trees to find the way back, to the signs and even to an election poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the <0x60>weekend of the Italians'.
There are no precise figures; we talk about 50,000 who set off through the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come on purpose from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross which performs a statistic on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place ahead of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted just a few weeks ago.
How fortunate that the politician used the word <0x60>relatively' and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), alongside the DAX, obtains a credit of one billion from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turmoil.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits were being issued up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
The money comes from private banks as well as public banks.
In the background, it is the daughter company Depfa that bears the losses.
The state financer had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - something that is no longer possible because of distrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 per cent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.37 million, and the equity rate had also slightly weakened from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net earnings from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period in the previous year, earnings from the allocation of specified receivables and securities and the termination of provisions in credit operations fell by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And only thanks to the significant profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the Konzern companies, the profit deficit of around 16 percent proved to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated poorly on industrial real estate loans, which were then subsidized to Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of projects jointly between private investors and the state (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the parent company, the Hypo Real Estate must carry out amortizations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group's gains and losses, which is still rather unclear.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been cut to two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other refinancing-dependent institutions on the interbank market since it has no client deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has again become considerably depleted, as banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 Billion Euros - of all Depfa loans a medium to short term refinancing.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the need for financing of the group is covered with the medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of the international financial markets largely out of order at the moment.
Other sources say refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, the chairman of HRE’s board of directors, Georg Funke, explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for Financial Services Surveillance (Bafin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Group is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors can only hope for it.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest releases, still on the verge of insolvency late Sunday evening, this bailout, at least provisionally, will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The share price fell by 75 percent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.30.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While first-rate debts have barely moved, second-rate loan prices are declining.
The most affected are above all the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and of course those that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of the Hypo Real Estate bank seemed previously to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the institution through the acquisition of Depfa bank.
As long as the issuing institutions, governments and commercial banks less affected are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that arrears will be resolved over time.
Or it will happen what no one dares to hope right now – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed rumours of partial nationalization, the likelihood that approached safety has now become a mere grounded hope.
This should set aside sleepless nights above all for long-term creditors to decide whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they’ve drawn on to defer losses to the next few years on the next capital income tax from stock gains automatically levied.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up for her first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: German is so "kawaii"!
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What did I get excited about?
The road to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to the Highschool of Tachibana.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I wasn't lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be set as strictly as here in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a round of the table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I did not yet have the school uniform, I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I stood before the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all did low Masses, laughed and waved, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii."
I knew him from my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable for the survival of Japanese teens and means "cute, darling".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to the best person, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all pulled out their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had herbal rice, small sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salted plums, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and that is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I’m curious to see if I can see it here as well.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading manga is what I’ve loved for years.
And in order to better understand manga and the culture there, at one point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats have feelings too.
A rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean that he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter difficult terrains because the Hardware does not fit.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it plays dead, runs away or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and in steering and executing functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At least, therefore, for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among which is the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is different even from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity could lie in the linguistic nature of Man: much of his existence being related to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, to be analyzed based on our own experience, then its observation poses great problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily accessible scientifically.
One could examine the processes of animal consciousness without taking into account their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach taken by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also underlines the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what does it mean for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) seizes on the living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to imput them to others other than ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities arise in the areas of the body sensation of the cortex and brainstem, just like Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could quite participate in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it is indisputable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in humans and rats is likely to be felt as fear in both cases: how could we check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but what if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Admittedly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain trunks, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brainstem at the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this for humans: how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations probably differ completely from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is nerve-wracking insofar as the same is true in rats and humans.
Since I do not explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist.
This could be judged as short-term, but I’d rather move forward than constantly bump into a wall.
I am a pragmatic emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and in its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
“But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can no longer waste time.
We have to work at maximum speed," Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis said.
"UEFA is always on our toes."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured the UEFA President in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League were convicted of compulsory relegation manipulation in the previous season; in the end, the start of the League even had to be delayed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid outraged by counterattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her privacy in an interview — and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her former adulterer Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counterattacks.
A belated Rose War for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in an unsightly battle – to the best of everyone.
In an interview with InStyle last week, Ryan said, “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
She would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to her being called an unfaithful husband fell clear: it would be “Monstruous,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News, that “Meg is once again remixing the story of our relationship and manipulating it.”
It would also be "regrettable" that "the pain and upheaval of a divorce for each child be revived again in public" for their common 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his response to the claw stroke: "In any case, my life goes on.
I consider myself happy to have a wonderful family that is at its best.”
Prices of air tickets and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be profitable again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices have risen for years, hotel nights have already fallen in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed by another 6.9 percent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the weak price of the dollar which led to a "wish for travel to decline of American tourists".
Financial centers such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by falling hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand with an increase of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was upwards in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, while long-haul flights, which were very fuel-intensive, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, economy class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but business and first class ticket prices were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even halved according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be on the one hand a slowing economic growth, explains the firm.
Demand would cede ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be accentuated competition pressure from the "Open Sky" Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the elimination by airlines of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that reportedly filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - there were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player only returned late to the game and his raised shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, it had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
“We need this second goal,” Hermann Rieger whistled in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the locker rooms, the halftime was over and most of them had sat down in their place.
Rieger was for almost three decades the physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and may it jump with this second goal!
The implementation was lacking.
“Everything was not very beautiful to see today,” Marcel Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard would have "wanted to be more relaxed as well".
This 1:0 (1:0 at halftime), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful header hit by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players from Gladbach could not hurt the weak players from Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Marin Jol.
The SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121st birthday on Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to take a step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
It is suspected that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the First League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its latecomers - Brazil's Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as debauched Jansen from FC Bayern - is certainly slowly forming, but it is not shining yet.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, there is fear.
The first news of the failure of the bailout caused the Dow Jones to temporarily fall by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in all of history.
Later on, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock index was trading 10,579 points with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were by that date American Express which was losing almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could make any more profits.
The shares of Goldman Sachs Bank fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the bailout plan, the funds must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in line with the price developments in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not palliate the concerns of investors.
The stock price of Germany’s major bank Hypo Real Estate is collapsing and pulling the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is collapsing despite the state-anticipated financial market bailout.
Dramatic declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The share of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost three-quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has seen a decline of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped sharply below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Around the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street was trading with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government’s $700 billion heavy bailout might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives had intended to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate is expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also saw only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index was down 3.2 percent for the time being, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after rising from 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng Index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.33 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The multinational trade and tourism company also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers perplexed: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon frozen fuel lines, cryogenic death threatens.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, Earth for example.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear in terms of speed.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the gravitational support anomaly.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the gravitational support anomaly using what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have known about the existence of dark matter only for about a decade.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that dark matter accounts for about one-fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting that preceded the release, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be underway.
The Germans are constantly in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was reported jointly by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
The Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are in the process of checking their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian along with their eight Egyptian escorts are well and safe, Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of the hostages remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the abduction, according to the words of an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without a shout.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the officer said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the story.
Abuse of a father-in-law" that led to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led to a woman committing suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro High Court ruled that he regularly tied his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise tied and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, an assiduous National Trust volunteer, was haunted by the abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told her that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, appeared since 2006 to be “emotionally dead,” and “had lost all hope for life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
We think she committed suicide by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's father-in-law, who had written a letter of confession that ended: "I tied her up and beat her regularly."
“I didn’t abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what’s even more amazing is the fact that if she hadn’t done that, her story would certainly never have ended in court.”
He added: "I particularly stress, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
“Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today.”
Sentenced for loss of official data.
The Office Cabinet minister who forgot top-secret documents on a train in June will be sentenced by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The Defense Department man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of people in Whitehall.
"They may have thought that this case would have stayed between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed, is accused of violation of section 8.1 of the act, that is to say of the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Secret Service Committee
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies facing the B&B bill.
The British construction companies may have to pay a bill of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million, to cover the bailout of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” to know that companies and their members will have to pay the price.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will increase at the same time, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have been cautious... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount proportionate to the deposits it holds, and that the intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates the interest on the loan to be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to settle interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, managing director of the Commercial Committee of Building Companies, told the BBC that he felt the decision was unfair.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have been cautious in the recovery of the housing market now have to pay for much less cautious institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first records.
“We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to evaluate the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salty bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the entire year, which could more than double.
Since building companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennies per liter
The people of Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy said it would increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pennies per liter starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, and comes as a result of research by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide if they will in turn, increase the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last changed in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi PM denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former PM Sheikh Hasina, who is likely to be arrested on her return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her indictment for extorting from a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges brought against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country’s provisional military government first give him full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s order.
“The Supreme Court dismissed Sheikh Hasina’s request saying it does not require bail as she had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will file an appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former leader of the Awami party said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June to treat herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations against them.
Concerns for the Afghan polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign because of Taliban-linked violence, the UN said.
Last week, the United Nations conducted a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she said she was unable to contact the children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located to the south.
A U.N. spokesperson said this happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV's court battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the Competition Commission's verdict, which would force it to reduce its stake in its rival transmitter ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement in fact to prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV's shares had cast doubt on ITV's effective independence, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate the matter.
Virgin boss Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its shares in ITV would not be reasonable and was on the contrary excessive – especially since BSkyB has just given up its voting rights.
A new investigation into the U.S. prosecutors case.
The U.S. attorney general appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of firing nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole thing was born from the account of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators, obstructing justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the cancellation in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department said prosecutors were fired for poor performance.
But it then emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others have reportedly refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, saying that he considered him "primary responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his role as a leader, "remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic must be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to receive this recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The awards night is presented by Coldplay, with this year’s selection being restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly does.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, peaking at number 15.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years on the English charts, and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday, by his real name - has suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing surgery to cure his heartbeat that became irregular, after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a severe laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in his vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Soon Be on Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, some only functional.
And even some veteran taxicabs and longtime local residents don't know how to get to Extra Place because they've never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street—not to be confused with Second Street—between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 30 feet wide by 120 feet long, it resembles a dusty driveway rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repave Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to the stores and boutiques, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood landlord committees, representatives from the city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee <0x23>3.
"There are only a few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to rehabilitate it and manage it, which by the way Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to replenish the small street and install seats, some of which would be used by a café to which the builder will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main interest is to relook this abandoned driveway, and make it public,” she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, noting further that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named after it since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The later entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scrap, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.”
Some residents, including bloggers who had previously talked about the evolution toward luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity – a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and blinds, full of newspapers from last week that fly along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs swiftly at the back of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the headquarters of a fancy clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passersby said they rarely think about Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Field, for his part, said he thought some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “have taken place in dark, damp, disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California student and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Thought. Why Middle Classes Should Be Able to Choose Their School.”
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign emphasizes that “African and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program particularly supports, among many other topics, “bilingual transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to pursue a bilingual education that advocates classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students at this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of them newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% have passed the 2008 State Math Examination, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the English-Language-of-Arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient other than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, a constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, this school has introduced full immersion English language instruction.
Total immersion in the English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, opposed to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance to identify him."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us."
Shouldn’t Mr. Obama take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in the other schools made up mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama’s response.
Although he favors the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently viewed this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop polemizing about the wording of English-language laws.
“On the contrary,” he said, “you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than disdaining them or deeming them insignificant.
Net Oil Drop Following the World Economy's New Concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people fear the bailout in favor of financial markets will bring the economy back to life.
Crude oil futures operations fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel. The New York Mercantile Exchange, during sales this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After rising to $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel this month before bouncing back in the face of deep financial market uncertainties.
On Monday, investors are again worried despite the agreement on the bailout, the largest in history, reached this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partly nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said this weekend’s frantic negotiations, concluded with the bailout deal, “appear to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchanges has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“When it comes to raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally and particularly in China.”
The bank's analysts lowered their expectations for next year, given the drops in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, so they were forced to decrease by 20 percent, the forecasts of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Feast of the Second Time Determining for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending more time in the last eight seasons than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen it all.
He was watching the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played under dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship took a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from halftime.
"I didn't get out of my zone," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a mediocre player."
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were wrestling, the defense beat Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a missed shot and made 32 yards until the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of that possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets picked up the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking a 34-0 lead.
It was the best the Jets could have scored in a while.
“Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said, ‘Second half or third half?’
When he was told the two – the Jets let through 21 undisputed points in the third half – Mangini said: “I can tell you that I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, breaks his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, has once again proven himself worthy of his title of best cross-country runner of the century, having broken his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2:03:59 victory in an accommodating race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat by 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, played last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record for his superb career, during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, the 1600 meter marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution would increase her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at start, 55 at finish- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans converted to cross-country runners, have contributed to lowering the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last decade since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, having suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier, and missing training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best.”
He has been blamed—especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s African rival—for having overly orchestrated his races, avoiding world marathon stars, actually relying on hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a cross-country runner.
On Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving on his best five-minute personal record.
Kamathis finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with a 7th time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her personal record of almost five minutes on her third marathon.
She ran using a clever strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a big lead, then surpassing them about 18 miles and a half later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and the trials of black life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first entirely black city to be integrated, the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make today." The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas , two schools and no prison".
It has now become a city of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in a variety of ways, the city she describes- has become touristy thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tour guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place of its own.
She is as independent, dignified, and deprived as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston recounted that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing us so little, does not know what he is losing."
Even if this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the look of the foreigner.
“We’re very cautious about how to tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a longtime resident and the city’s oldest parishioner.
"it must conform to reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover as well as a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture – sometimes disdained, sometimes acclaimed – that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
Interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt, dialect-filled books, such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just off Highway 17, a road that crosses central Florida, often forgotten, which ends up in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a doughnut in life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
"Passed the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he can barely read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve passing people.
So, in barely a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn't really a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young girls Hurston immortalized, quoting colorless songs, performed by men praising their beauty.
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered as a lively, eccentric person, who frequently returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, aboard a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and wore trousers here, where even today, one is proud of the traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin recounted, while many mocked her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he adds further, swinging in his chair from the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big commemorations, no plaques for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy she gave to the world,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to move a five-lane highway through town, replacing Kennedy Boulevard, the community's two-lane main street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing dispute brought hatred to the gates of the community.
“At that time, a bunch of young white people were throwing oranges or objects at people sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
"A lady has even died."
They threw a watermelon out of their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston called into question the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying of my race".
Residents are now proclaiming that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville’s cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening as well," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Eatonville Community Safeguards, a nonprofit group.
It lasted, she added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white – I mean there’s a cultural line here,” Nathiri said.
Civil rights, by the way, have created space for many more Zora Neale Hurston—black writers, actors, and artists who have gone beyond harm, such as herself, armed with joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as, “How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company?”
It exceeds me.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's unnamed grave and began fighting to revive his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced it to the American cannons.
The highway project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter had regained its appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival’s opening two years later, and many are returning in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county pushed back the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summed it up by stating that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic city since 1998.
A single-theme library (of course renamed Hurston) opened in 2006 on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be considered a backstreet on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Now there are 90 percent blacks.)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be sought for most interviews, and certain things—such as the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the fields—should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher who has a soft spot for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be misunderstood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride emerged.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed up than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is true that there is sincere civic affection in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, which need additional forces.
And even for the youngest, like Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
“Most of the people who pass through that area will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone speaks fluently about finance.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newsstand and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst “work day at the office” since the 1929 crash.
Deliverers continue to sneak onto the sidewalks, with their trolleys and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latinos still hang around residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on their shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to go and open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, as I was discovering at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people standing in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desks, or to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service desk, where regular customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asked for directions for the Macy's store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my “authorized personal banker,” all lined up for the same reason I did.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit unions, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and which claim to treat customers as their family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327, turned to the bankruptcy trustee, and while New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and store employees in front of me, frightened of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that they believe is reliable, the one that does the most bailout on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its meager CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who has abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting mosques striped in red.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged in the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning, according to police, an organized action.
The offenders painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on several tombs, but detectives believe it could have been done to disguise extremists' hatred of Muslim immigrants.
This accident could in some way be related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said it was "deeply shocked" by the announcement of the desecration, which comes just during the religious month of Ramadan, which is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which won nearly 30 percent of the vote, ran an anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were even seen by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against wearing scarves and burkas, and even expressed opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties attempt to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made a difference because they were worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter banned from traveling abroad.
The courts have banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities who controlled him, his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent granted the travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse to magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in the Ashford courts of limited jurisdiction, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson said "On Thursday, Sept. 25 at Ashford Court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not present at the time.
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if he was registered on the list of sexual abuse accused.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years imprisonment.
Kent police said they would not discuss Glitter’s particular cases or potential moves in the county.
A Kent Police spokesperson said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those abroad.
"In our opinion, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, much more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the Kent Police’s dearest intention, and we closely monitor the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, 10 and 11 years old, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from checking his passports, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court of limited jurisdiction in Uxbridge, West London, to register him on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already served a four-month sentence in the UK, for holding images of child abuse.
A Interior Ministry source said Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off the stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments unknown to the general public, where one discovers to intimate gestures and stolen gazes of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some staging with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the program of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you do not have to take pictures on stage.
They have their own personality and character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera moments of personality of flamenco stars.
With the festival "Popular Song of the Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, recall classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not dance or singing in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essential and the magic has been the constant of this work that we present these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has evolved into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collection of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraiture led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph people's portraits, get to know them and be able to enter their lives for a longer or shorter time.
I think that in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or that leave you only a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I’m still trying to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that is entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 of rue de la Mata (street parallel to the People's Square of Hercules) which will be open until October 16.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he writes is “true audacity”
The novel takes place in unknown places and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he is working, a novel that has as main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who has passed through the Amazon.
The winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies him "is a real audacity" and that "everything demonstrates that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I would not do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a parade in the city of the aqueduct of a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the prize of the Hay Festival with the majority of the votes of the participants, made room full at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in the face of a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live a very recriticous part of the work"; how he wrote of a "recriing"
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less alike" because they have been asked to "leave their imaginations" and not to "write" them.
Bad weather spoils the fair in Pozoblanco
The banderilla festival that concluded the bullfights of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the riding bullfighters checked that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather was fierce on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull run planned.
On the screen were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco
Thus only the feast of Friday took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements facing the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the uncovered stands applauded more than his fight in himself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police check a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrested two occupants of a van and the latter two undertake the flight.
Its load, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
Police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to information released by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle control on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the side, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with bales of hashish, which was then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drugs.
In addition, the grievors found that the license plate had been "falsified" since it did not match the one written on the van's grey card, which is also why they charged the detainee with a document forgery offence.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the source of the seized drug.
The detainee, 28-year-old A. A. J., has been placed in police custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried in the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving on Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesperson for the California police patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear was “pressing the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going backwards several times, she rolled on her sunglasses.”
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop in the middle of the highway and get out of her vehicle.
That person, at the time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the officers took her to the center specializing in drugs and alcohol to perform a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the outset, although "according to the police officers' observation at first glance, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was detained at around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from the Arizona clinic where she was being treated for a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The coordinator general and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Councillor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing favourable treatments to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the behavior of the political party that he will have to adopt in the city council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended these kinds of cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
" Sangre de Mayo ", Garci's daring bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with almost 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried to "stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a TV series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci assures that he achieved with this filming "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to shoot a film commemorating the two hundred years of the 2nd of May in Madrid, something that he always accepted when the story stuck to the national historical facts.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has misled itself as a leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double the one obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he was unable to shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated during almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting filming and to whom he does not cast, since it seems "humiliating" to him and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Blood of Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times nominee for the Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three films nominees that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven tables de billiard français" and finally the winner, "Les tournesols aveugles", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserved to be better known", he said.
With this movie Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that you’re only working for prosperity, and now you’re just making one more movie,” Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the shoes of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, the daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three went to live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented women's free movement.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to play the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the dance of the snake" to some tangos.
Her dancing was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers,” she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally willing to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me.”
The staging was also done thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; to the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as to the viola of Rafa El Viola and to the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who played the role of the eternal com
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, in the United States, or in Russia, but also in all Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it's these women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and highlights her work," Bayón says.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Newly Married Poet" in St. Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennity of Zenobia and Juan Ramón "of the Nobel Prize for Concession (2006-2008), organized in order to
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This Poplar of Light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling during the various International Congresses of New York, will go to
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America Is Less Liked Without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice," and illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He struggled to get an Oscar.
He hasn’t toured since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels exceeds all expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better thanks to his existence.”
No one was afraid to ridicule or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and the stock markets scared, the esteem of Americans fell very low, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and there is no reason to live, there is nothing left to human beings but admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and advocated for lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his elder who died from an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the height of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He set us high," said George Clooney, who may be the only one today trying to pierce the screen like Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious and goalless privacy.
It’s still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal even though he did not lack opportunities to not be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly watches his daughters meet their fans on earth, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been more proud than the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist,” he said.
Madrid in the 2016 Summer Olympics Organising Race
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could come true in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I’ve ever raced.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of an elimination note.
But let’s look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
The mistakes begin with the withdrawal of the bibs, which forces you to go there early.
It's not bad but if they make you move it would be better for them to give you everything (including the shopping chip).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size ' S ' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small size jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults took place from the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not mark the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to give an example of a perfect race, I wouldn’t think of it.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft was introduced a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) in response to what was asked of him during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that they do not belong to the group that is talking to her and that they are not part of the company.
She asks if she is here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer in a few moments.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essentials instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding features and "extras" to Windows.
A change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary since it is the essential basis for the computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It holds the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right, man.
It will never disappear but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer just to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who are half of the applications that come with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, messy, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, indeed, and I’ll show you an example.
The photo in this article, was taken earlier this month in one of the restrooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or in 2010.
Microsoft will probably be trying to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone being already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the Muscle Gay Association.
And if we start to list all his appearances, we could also mention this strong mustache who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
It is not just a simple cotton men's body jersey, moulding and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most famous body jerseys have around the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxer shorts, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Although it is a pity to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
Her enormous resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris to its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis of your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s delights us and we get a lot of inspiration for our collections.
I really like walking around the city and watching the women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to look in my aunt’s closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers really like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you put on clothes, that’s when you really put yourself in the character’s shoes.
All of a sudden, everything is connected.
You had it not long ago 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
No, I'm not.
I feel better than ever, my 30s make me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I did all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me to, and moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you wait for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to come out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can’t wait for the movies ‘The Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’ to come out.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the runway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't go on the bridge to be a model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we exhibited – I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango – were being auctioned off to raise money for Naomi’s NGO.
People that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things are not true.
Also, this very good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to pear, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World.
Re-offenders of alcohol driving will have to install the 'alcocock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle in a state of drunkenness, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its goal is to reintegrate the driver by offering road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety, as well as the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Automotive Safety Foundation, will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for having driven more than once in a state of drunkenness, resume the car.
The alcoholock would prevent this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol content in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol content is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is at the expense of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of infringements during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, the reform done by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the Spanish air force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was on the eve of sunset but its rays still forced to put their hand as a visor to be able to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
- Ah, all right, so we won't be able to go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... Are you from here or...?
- No, no sir, I'm Spanish but I lived here thinking two years.
- Ah, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
Several are waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row consisting of 27 marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is very soberly dressed and does not wear her usual peep-toes; perhaps they had told her that a thunderstorm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing through the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television journalist is waiting for them.
The most prestigious fashion award
Surely there is no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and surely there is no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango shop window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried out of emotion.
It is certainly the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the contest, made us end up at a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the table of the extraordinary Chagals family next door, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having fat on the heart and doing against bad fortune good heart, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a Mango garment and some adornments of ELAH, which cut the breath, and arms up, arms down with his son Luis – a handsome man almost two meters high – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and the Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with big pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner transformed herself by wearing a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the rehearsal room of the ballets.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the dependencies of the palace, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man who travels by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not just 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to bookshops on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 o’clock, but it’s even worse when we think about the restless pace that life imposes on us today.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to each person's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled ' 1001 ways to relax ' and will arrive at the bookstores directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places like work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ denies such a belief.

If the adrenaline doesn’t run through your veins to restore your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children talk at night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk while they sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep that is called somnilochia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely there are more than one who speaks at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (peeing in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, situations of stress or overexcitation.
In any case, it is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with shouts, crying, long speeches ...
In the event that sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep disturbance that can be cured (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the somniloquies appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless since he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not usual), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because in sleep, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to find out his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, this is nothing very nasty, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern has finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of famine.
Without making a big match, the Yellows and Blacks created the most chances and managed to turn one for the win of the match.
The rhythm was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers had a hard time expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann, who was rubbing the skylight on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascendant slightly and in turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn on top, Romain from the tip of the foot or Diebold came to tickle the defense of Dannemarie.
Opposite, we were making block in the middle of the field and we were just leaving the Riahi stirrer at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to take a repulsed ball on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the Illhousiens scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not know how to take advantage of it and will not cause big problems to an Illusian Eleven who just backed up a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of play where, after a big scuffle, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of force of the fishermen who strongly disturbed Monday the access of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the surge in diesel prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to the spokesman of the Elysee David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing stoppages of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not stopped.
A filter dam has been set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination Monday by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic and English Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where trawlers have remained at the dock, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats have blocked the movements of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the important refinery Total de Donges in the evening.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go" and "they do not wish to move to Paris", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chair of the committee of fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a diesel of less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 delivery forecast
The Brazilian planemaker expects 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that hover over the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been bailed out by U.S. monetary authorities, plans to divest more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it was given, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to consider selling most of its business beyond its international life insurance and retirement business in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the matter.
The board of directors of AIG met Sunday evening to examine possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to divest include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise cash to repay the $85 billion Federal Reserve loan at the risk of U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders in due proportion.
Analysis Paris Session History Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange plunged on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss close to 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The tech-dominant Nasdaq Index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 Index 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street plunged after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout that was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market counted on this plan," she added, fearing that a draft adopted in several days would come "too late."
"If the project is indeed moribund ... then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the downfall of a financial institution" in the United States, said Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the takeover of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing "not only a US crisis, but a global crisis," the analyst said.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.632%, from 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year yield to 4.161%, from 4.357% the day before.
Obama wins points in first televised duel
In Friday's first debate between the two candidates for the White House succeeded another to find out who, John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign HQs proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that was reportedly followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to halt his decline in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), believes it was the Democrat who pulled his pin from the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won for 39 percent of those polled, while 25 percent of them conceded victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts," Clinton said at the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he has repeatedly accused.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama said he was the future.
Without breaking up, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, while Obama does,” a Democratic spot criticized the Republican for not taking full account of the impact of the crisis on the “street American.”
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election rally in North Carolina in heavy rain.
He did not even utter the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial rout clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most likely to save the economy on the brink.
“The coming week could be a turning point,” said influential Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
“The current debacle is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would still be able to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite the upheavals of Wall Street, the senator of Illinois also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, meanwhile, wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, the two candidates dodged questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as polling stations closed in Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit they didn’t even vote: “What good, since they will do what they want with my voice,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression on foreign observers in order to regain its grip on the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if the elections were considered clean by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept out of the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the count," said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and with us, it's the executive branch.
If opposition MPs enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe which followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the election.
She stresses that turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
"Have you noticed that there was an election, you?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls again on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
The Interview - Blood Becomes Safe Again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And most importantly, he regained public confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this tragedy and the grumbling of the public, in February 1994 the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from occurring again.
While Justice Krever was delaying the filing of his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its operations, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field in the years that followed, we regained the public's trust," she said, before proudly asserting that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "confidence is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were seen in Europe, says the one that has held the strong since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
One of the key recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of persons who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
Now, a few years ago, it has been demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle we applied made sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which allow the presence of the virus itself in the blood of donors to be detected directly, rather than the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have made it possible to shorten the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period was reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors may be infected unknowingly and may not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be dispensed before someone becomes infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says the CEO of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
One never knows which pathogen will emerge in the system.
As recently as last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide a sufficient supply.
“Needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has an impact on the blood donor network, which on average comprises only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Any healthy person 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is prevalent, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But the members of this donor network need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today’s life is so frantic, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, once considered a biomedical waste, is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated a few weeks ago the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to take more than a thousand per year.
We should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-Finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division playoffs, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 goals in total) victory over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive game of the quarterfinals in total goals at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the rest of the Montreal line-up.
Roger Levesque was the only one to thwart Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first game of the round-trip series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's Victorious Goal
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to embark on the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian in the barrage shots against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored one goal, Plekanec collected two helpers, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much in the first half,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a great ovation.”
Charest bets on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the possibility of holding elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council was over, Jean Charest travelled yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec City, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Pushing the limits of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad outlines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a sort of Mill of images.
On three huge screens, spectacular snapshots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
It’s as big as in an election period.
In a press briefing, the Prime Minister declined to rule out that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give deadlines, investment amounts, or specific priorities in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, forestry, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France", "is at home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it at home, but it is in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press briefing.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the land, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member for Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The prime minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would, moreover, be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the Liberals who came before us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Station into Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has shaped the future," Charest said.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, conservative one, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest pointed out that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
"It's between us there, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, arousing applause from them.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless filled, notably by a mission of the council of the federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that passed like a letter to the post: the PLQ demands in particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have a veto over decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad outlines of the Plan Nord were welcomed with skepticism.
The chief fisherman, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today," commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the adoption of a Plan Nord by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister in the Harper cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To cast the reproach on this woman who has waged an unceasing struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
This is a government that is the only one of all the Western countries involved that has not repatriated its national from the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
As a reminder, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he enjoys a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuses.
We do not realize it yet, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy”, that word that Harper keeps brandishing and that rings so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when no morality exists anymore: a Canadian citizen can be abused, tortured, and arbitrarily imprisoned according to the good will of a hitherto minority head of government (so what will happen after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has given up what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house without a penny in order to launch a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition as well as scare anyone who dares to look again at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally conducted through the exchange of ideas and not with batons.
It was therefore enough for the mine to open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to distrust public opinion and rejects Black Canada's petitions and letters of support.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both call for a "public" debate while disregarding the views of that same public?
In the vice president's world, it seems that this word only refers to high-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a slap in the face (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a formal notice against the authors of Black Canada instructing them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s pursuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that displease the wealthy businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated prosecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate pursuit makes it clear that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for transparent debate.
It is a loss to academia, as it is to public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
It includes: better control by the elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of watch over the salaries paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards a deal that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything was done in such a way as to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: If we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption to Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had turned to sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect that a new failure would cause on the mood of investors.
The deadline we agreed on was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election were rather supportive of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that we are forced to reach this extreme.
Democratic Sen. Barack Obama has added some provisions to the agreement, including allowing homeowners to keep their homes and the salary of executives of state-survived businesses.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he said on U.S. television.
Asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The outlines that I’ve read [show] that it’s something we’re all going to have to digest and that we’re going to be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsaleable claims of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprimes) before extending to other more widespread forms of debt securities (PCAAs) and resulting in a liquidity freeze and the debandade of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans who thwarted the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed that we have emerged from this impasse since the Democrats accepted that some “toxic” assets of troubled companies are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to incur losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion is expected to be endorsed by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain stakes in the rescued companies that will earn him dividends in case of profit and which he can resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to postpone seizure procedures for homes attached to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on compensation and severance payouts to the executives of the affected businesses.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Yesterday, votes continued to rise against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” House Finance Committee member Scott Garrett, a Republican, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
It is not about profiting the taxpayers.”
Speaker of a small group in Congress dubbed the “skeptic caucus,” Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to rush and to carefully consider the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renouncing to acquire its competitor in the middle of a shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of Europe’s 20 largest banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, you get a vote in the bank and influence.
It’s precisely something that savers and households appreciate now that the times are looking uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed on track to nationalize another bank battered by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the loans underway at the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (US $ 75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy the branches and the customer accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time his card asset, some will say his weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
What a great racer!
Paul Newman, who passed away Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in his glory years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a native Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate brand of quality.
For in him a whole country was projected in love with the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 50s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theatre, on television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who finished second at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, paired with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the shadows of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the splinters of show business, whose enigma we have not quite pierced.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman made moviegoers dizzy this weekend, as his big roles on the black screen of memories collide.
More than half a century of an ever-changing seventh American art runs through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Burning Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, reprised after his death, which really released Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting (The Scam), Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen’s beautiful The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character on the return in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, which in 1987 earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
That face through the ages, it was him.
It's him again.
Epochs are shaking through its course.
Young people know him best through George Roy Hill's cult Slap Shot (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Coen Brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as a sponsor of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes’ Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Contrary to several film legends who gave up the profession early enough, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendours and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging its performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles fell long baked in the beak.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginalized: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown facets of his true modesty.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He lost his son Scott to an overdose and dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes that poured yesterday on Newman, his great boyfriend and former fellow-at-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the deceased actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the Hollywood drifts.
We will have seen much of his binette to sit on jars of dressing, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, although gag at first.
Nonetheless, the proceeds of these sales were donated to his Foundation for Children in Trouble.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And it is a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag & Company do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings concerning the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly significant damage. Other charges have been brought against them, such as forgery and use of forgeries.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, into the pockets of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to collect money from subsidies obtained by issuing expense invoices, under which no real benefit was provided and thus the associations never fulfilled their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they procured notebooks at the Józsefváros market, while they manufactured the stamps at Kiskunhalas.
The names of companies that were to appear on the invoices were decided, inter alia, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the deposition of the latter, he had to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for drafting the files necessary for obtaining the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for as many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, which would later bear the name of Együtt to Harmadik Evezredert, was teeming with errors of form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there, yet the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
The bill issuers with overflowing imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért nor Hoppá's name appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor's office.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecution summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, a hundred people stayed there, did not fit, either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The zealous invoice issuers also did not inquire about the Budapest travel agencies of their choice, but only organized trips abroad, so they naively indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which is also contrary to the agency's accounting practices.
In addition, as it emerged during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while services relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up in the name of the Hotel Révfülöp to the order of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the false ones were sent to the hand.
The prosecution's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes in mentioning the carriage of goods by road as a service, which the company issuing the invoices could not perform, since its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it is also for defects of form, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and of Biztos Pont have been found to be false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó sports course, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Neither did the forgers pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at home, which is why, according to our information, the liquidator of the company denied issuing this invoice.
Deliberately established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták Group, has issued an invoice to the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Evezredért for a sum of HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány Foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület.
There was no financial movement, either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this was avoided by the agencies from mentioning it in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general manager of the company Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade of fuel and motor vehicles, whose headquarters were in Budapest, but where he was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov also reportedly sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
From what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies worked, which the accused explained by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as drafter of the founding documents of the companies, he established invoices in their names, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov gave organizations a total of 15 invoices issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution believed that 10% of the sums indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországárt applied for a grant to the socialist party's public benefit organization, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant in the amount of HUF 500,000 twice, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from becoming known, five dummy invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, it was these invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report on the method of manufacturing the invoices, as they did before the Public Prosecutor's Office.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the slightest detail, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the Socialists would have reached an agreement whereby in return for the reimbursement of a large part of the HUF 50 million, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably offended, since the demands for his placement under house arrest, on the basis of a relief of his conditions of detention, continually fall into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait in their own homes for the end of the procedure. He does not have this possibility.
The Psychology of Overbidding: Why Are We Spending More Money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at New York University have managed to update the neurological and economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay a price that is too high.
This research has attempted to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group participated in a fun auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the surplus of a third, the whole under the brainstem, called striatum, was set in motion intensively when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the nervous system's "self-stimulation" mechanism.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economist members of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these, three groups overbid in front of a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they won the game, then they would receive an additional $15, as a reward.
While the third group received that $15 before the auction, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis on one was on victory, while on the other, on failure.
By proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the team of players "against failure" were willing to bet higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor in the Faculty of Economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
There are an estimated 100 miles of patients in Hungary who carry the hepatitis virus, but only 7 miles are being treated because patients often don't know they are carrying the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g., contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organ fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travellers are advised to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, usually accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach ache and nausea.
Then a visible jaundice develops on the skin and on the white of the eye, the stools become lighter and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, one million people die each year from the most serious form of this disease, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not known to have the virus, because the pathogenic gene sneakingly destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and tattooed people.
There are currently 200 million people living with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does he who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing to what extent belief in God could influence human tolerance of pain.
As part of this bizarre experience, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Through a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments in which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More precisely, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look sustainedly at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, focused on its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and in the meantime, received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed one.
The Catholics said that at the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt as “safe”, as someone who is “taken care of” and they “calmed down, and peace invaded them”.
At the sight of the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at the work of Leonardo.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided one finds the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image that they react to very positively, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, an Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases, it actually changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if we show the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a better quality Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You are what you disclose about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of people's pockets as well as the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their interests are.
Yet that is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While skeptics draw a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they don't see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can meet their original goal that sounded like: “Let’s collect in one system all the information of the world!”.
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of global upheaval, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
Schmidt responded that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What would work best for me?" However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, when it knows enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages visited by the interested parties are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will prefer to submit our products and services recorded on the basis of our previous statement.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can elicit fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can elicit a counter-reaction in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the searched terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example in recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing an identification.
Human rights-conscious Internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, upside down with the electronic legal protection body EFF, proved its rightfulness in court against the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google will still not be compelled by any of the points in the constitution to disclose information about the FBI’s secret request, of whatever nature
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms it had won over the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier, but ultimately failed to obtain lists of private users' searches, or the entire list of websites and keywords from the past two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they start to use Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is demonstrated against the multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its “savages” bringing together computer enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big business, the “connected corporation,” as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as an invader of the world because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and program package, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what the web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, draws precisely behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 is nothing more than collaboration, the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels made available to us, and while the size of these changes one by one, the main thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link these to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep more photos than they automatically appear on F's stock blogs, in which they appear.
While we can get acquainted with many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of his employees, just for the sincere opinions that this one has written on his blog about the top management, we can be sure of a private life:
One who lives an online life, is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's young people.
One wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to bypass Google’s monopoly, can do it (beginning, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not the least. Google online services, through text processing to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked up to huge profiles of our servers and servers that do not have the best profiles.
The public expects, without really hiding from it, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, while the services introduced at an increasing speed cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other computer companies.
However, the critical observers find, beside all this, contradictions having disturbing effects. For example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the corporate kindergarten and after the company has deemed too expensive the daily multiple catering, taken anytime after the company's google has already made it look derisive.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new medical services are not announced until they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that the project of scanning and archiving Google's books and magazines takes on such important dimensions that the company's system will soon find itself in the hands of the court.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian halftones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way just through Google data.
Two miners helped to remove the traces of the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd
"The police summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd. Based on well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime," - said the spokesman of the Borsod department police station.
The young people have acknowledged the facts of which they are accused, but for the moment they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency), are young girls, defend themselves freely.
Complicity in murder can lead to imprisonment for up to five years.
The suspect in the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and out of interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and it is for this reason that he drew his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, 9 years old.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of that.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech kroner, for the purchase of 100% of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid to date for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new owner the least good, and did not rule out the fact that this could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion CZK by market experts.
Based on an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent of shares, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, which is getting worse by the day, the leading European newspapers already mention a "second 9/11".
"The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president," accuses the Rome daily, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, as billionaire Warren Buffett once said, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing every day, and the whole world will pay the heavy price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real danger threatens, that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the balance, just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still lay a lifeline to their hesitant financial institutions, and with taxpayer money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to pay little attention to their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands in their pockets, very deeply, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is passing through the old continent.
The "rescuers" must not immediately raise a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The smart car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What better way to develop barrier-avoiding technologies than by imitating an existing obstacle detector in nature?
For example, that of bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, buzzing bees gave the initial strategic idea to Nissan engineers, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired, self-robot-controlled system, of the BR23C type, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee forms its own space, of oval shape, which in reality, looks a lot like our safe shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a primary role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it by an angle sufficient to avoid the collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If it were not so, the mini auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," says Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees have to avoid the other bees, in our case, we have been able to use only the rotary movement, the acceleration as well as the slowing as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy concentration, making their lifespan longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don't need memory with a capacity of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instant avoidance. According to Nissan estimates, this system will enter mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles in his way.
We even gave the baby a priceless name
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at buying back the banks’ dubious loans, and to be used in several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of that amount will be spent.
Reuters reports that in new debates lasting until after midnight on Saturday, local East Coast time, congressional leaders have agreed on controversies that have existed for days and days around the $700 billion bailout.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said it was time to put the deals on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of bailing out Wall Street, but of turning the gears of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill called the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then, the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the advances made tonight, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
In addition, the program differs from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that the $700 billion had to be spent in one go, to buy back the securities on dubious credits.
From now on, no more than half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after the law is passed by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to buy doubtful claims from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
Spending the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase dubious receivables, securities relating to dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" receivables.
Competent departmental officials have stated that buybacks can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives companies the opportunity to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that give rise to the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to provide $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast redemption of doubtful claims, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system leading to the collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in a bad position and waiting for state aid can expect their severance pay, simply called a golden parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
The salary cap is only mentioned in specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers assistance to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back as part of an auction, they will levy a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the repurchase of the bad debts, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the amount paid to executives is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it must still be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap applies only to new contracts, this to motivate the participation in the plan.
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal caps will be in place on directors-general appointments, said the chairman of the House Financial Benefits Committee, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the state obtains a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it the rescued banks fall on their feet.
The bill states that within the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will decide how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed doubts about this plan.
That’s not why U.S. citizens have mandated us, this doesn’t protect taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes it is the same people who are pressing for action as those responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, reports the Hungarian Central Statistical Office.
Industrial export selling prices increased by 1.1 percent compared to July 2008, while compared to a year earlier they decreased by 3.9 percent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 percent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 percent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices increased only to a lesser extent: 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sectors were only slightly higher by 0.1 percent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather goods and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), with bags and belts manufacturing in the first place with a monthly increase of 4.6 percent, followed by footwear production with a monthly increase of 2.5 percent.
The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing sector of chemicals and products (1.6 percent).
Deflation resulted in oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery and appliances manufacturing (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices for paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase, between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which play a significant role in domestic industrial operations, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the effect of the gas price increase implemented by the authorities since July 1.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, it was the prices of the petroleum processing sector that experienced the most significant increase (32.4 percent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price decreases occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
Across the processing industry, prices increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Electricity, gas, steam and water supply prices were 18.7 percent higher than in the previous year.
Among domestic trade groups and by sector assignment, the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was seen in August by those sectors that initiated profit on investment.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and materials production sectors for further processing did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the sectors of energy production and materials for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while for the profit-initiating sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent was measured.
Export sales prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that by January 12, the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force, as the Foreign Minister told leaders of the local Hungarian community in Chicago.
“Now everything depends only on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into service.”
At all times, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to check in before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations starting today, in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will be awarded the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary with the Order of Merit Star, and will hold a meeting with the foreign policy advisors of presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both back bank bailout
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, assured their support for the government’s $700 billion bailout, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the U.S. Treasury Secretary.
After marathon negotiations that lasted for days and days, the representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they have concluded agreements in principle on the bailout plan of the banks.
This financing plan, which aims to thaw the Wall Street crisis and the crippled credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each more apt than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a little ahead. McCain's lead, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a jersey shortly after the Republican convention, has melted away.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would swiftly vote on the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supports.
"It is now that we must act, responsibly ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to call McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all struggle to swallow it ... but doing nothing is not a possible way.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal mentions the creation of a Treasury Control Board and the capping of senior executive severance pay, and that he was personally very committed to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role on the merits in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The Press Review of the German Language Territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more conscious - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of the Reds and Blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian revolution devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is the same modern citizens who are turning their backs on them.
This change of epoch is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, came to an end a process that was likely only ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was picking up at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections of 2005, that is to say at the time of the much-discussed Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", implemented in the region consistently by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been seriously mistaken about the pace, but the secularization, educational outcomes and establishment of North and East Germans in the developing region of Bavaria could not be without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also astonishing that in recent weeks it has been the traditional groups of citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, the artisans, the bachelor's and the graduates.
In these groups, UHC support fell below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? Party presidents stand on the sidelines in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the confusing domestic policy situation that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SP<0xC3><0x96> want to talk with the Conservatives of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The populist BZ<0xC3><0x96> party is open to negotiations and the Greens still do not want to agree on the coalition.
Elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during debates held on public television, party leaders have barely let their cards glimpse.
Werner Faymann, president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wanted to talk to the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question of whether he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann's part.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or the entry into the coalition is momentarily an entirely open question; these points must absolutely be debated within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of the reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as the representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons for the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP of Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the right that most affects Roma children and as such, one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Popular Party group, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions observed during hiring, Roma disappear from the labor market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a small part has the opportunity to obtain a higher education diploma."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as an elementary human right plays a key role in enforcing other fundamental rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economies of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child starts school, the greater his or her chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his or her income and consumption, he or she participates in the state budget.
"Because of their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected from a low-quality and sectarian education," - underlined Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the European Union's objective-oriented collaboration and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools, for which compliance with existing and under preparation anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the democratic opportunities to participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Járóka said.
In the name of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for all, the objective of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, held every year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to provide a single platform to support the measures taken to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: the grace for a transition period
The decision on the fate of the fallen Huber-Beckstein duo will be taken in October
Despite this pitiful election failure, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been postponed.
The party president, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still hold their place. The question is how long will the grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, in any case, made it feel that they did not particularly care for their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the faction and the base, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
But the Conservatives are still very important in this region in the south, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates tactful discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the possible Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values of the Munich government.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Voters, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as the possibility of a putsch perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, to then treat without care the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now, the leaders of the CSU are putting all their energy into stabilizing, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far been pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some bitter remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be Chancellor again if they somehow re-establish a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment over the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of ground will not negatively influence Berlin’s grand coalition.
This is however relative because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the social democrats always lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukashenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MPs entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-person legislature in this 10-million-populated country has been running very well from opposition for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as president for the fourth time, would "change" the elections.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically dependent more and more on Russia, would want to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition, led to the natural decrease of the gas, and the Russian cause has to take a credit
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than failures, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates, was a reference to a prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present when counting the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "power was afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring in even a single opponent".
The opposition does not anticipate protests in view of the results, but rather tries to convey its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we really have a lot of worries on this side: we have to have our opposing newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the crosshairs when it comes to broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - said Milinkevich, considering the social layer more appropriate, referring to the fact that in the current regime of the main Lukasko, the main security.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery,' is only a matter of time," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Starting today, breakfast before work".
Never in the history of the Chigi Palace had there been revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But as of today, this new measure is in force against smart people, against whom he points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," says the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"This is reformism," Brunetta said.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of the employees was recorded, the secretary general assures: "it is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissants.
Promise of Brunetta, who suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 am is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister communicates that “‘in three months, the absences of sickness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in a year”.
And he adds that it is essential to make more efficient, the Public Administration .
Italian, "whose wage dynamics- explains the minister- in the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree using Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is spreading today the data concerning the decrease in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the "active sloths" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive employees of the Public Administration have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in case of infirmity due to service is contested; the extension of the hours of home hours of the sick worker, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Workplace accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 permanently disabled people.
In 2007, the Inail data confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
These figures testify to the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the leading causes of death, causing almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To get the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data released by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of the Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuing associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and awareness raising of public opinion"
Naturally indignant, everyone has struck a fist to put an end to such tragedies that, because of their dimension, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not under assessing the alarm on the social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but that does not prevent the number of white deaths is still impressive ", said later the president of the Amil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this 'discount trend' to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
"we believe that in general, not enough is done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be made through multiple actions."
"According to us- Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are needed, as well as more intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added- "that there is still an effort to be made with regard to communication and public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of work" and the "drift of assistance to which the system is oriented in recent years".
The aim is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the one who has an accident should not depend on the spontaneity or the enlargement of the legislator.
Mp3 player pointed finger, they put hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a statement issued in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
According to the report, “5-10% of those who listen to music at full volume using portable music devices for at least 5 years, for more than an hour a day per week, are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” Kuneva said.
“According to the scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
In addition, we need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can keep up with new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"The scientists confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
This data can be effectively limited by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of noise exposure.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods are at risk of permanent hearing loss after 5 years.
This affects 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to send the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other Commission members will finalise the directives for Rome.
In March when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which can be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No overlapping roles, but only the willingness to have a corner to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March, it will have finished its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June – the mayor announced – we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital.
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of everyday life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see ahead, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome would like to emphasize that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to Roman city dwellers, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, ".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a Capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to pass for independent wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are escalating as the election date draws closer.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really bold: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and they do not answer the question of all the voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
Here is an aspect of the American mentality that has been kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross, on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's point of weakness.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
In the United States, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "murderer" of newspapers.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to information attachés, feeling less worried about credibility.
They do not feel isolated as they once did.
The problem of American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on assembling the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public understands it is not to be significantly reduced.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed publication versus broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are making their way to the Internet, perceived by many as the "killer" of newspapers.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to getting into technology hoping it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest drawback in American journalism lies between those who run the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to the "safety of work".
Directors who expect to lose their jobs within 3 years, are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we are at 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always get big salaries, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, a number of years passed.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the case of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had requested to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the Unipol-Bnl Escalation Instruction.
During the trial against him last week, he was released from his home and turned into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel from the provincial city to a house in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which the prosecutor did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion bailout approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms it communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to “the people of Washington” and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, precisely, which made itself felt in a despotic way with the vote of which I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is only one example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake is foreshadowing or already letting go: not only in the United States, but in the whole West, and perhaps not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena incubated for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of sovereign state, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that have, obviously, close relations with foreign countries, but that, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears globally economically but politically, it is almost only national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of the way or has little to say: the obvious proof is provided by the European Union which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, fails to decide on a common political line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit affection: when you go through a difficult period, it is only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that the more recent economic developments tend to attribute to a factor quite linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, indeed, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with the little material things.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but that are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than who is not, that is, who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadows.
And besides, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of estrangement that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more foreign to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeds in an underground way, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "arrivals" or else, in the collective mood changes of the last few times, from the conservative rise in Austria to Bavaria to the American victory in the Great Rebellion.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, have more and more difficulty, which does not date from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and agitates potentially in a demeaned way.
In view of all this, to speak of a current “rebellion of the masses” on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated.
But they say well, keep your eyes wide open, it is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
That is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to hold a 100 kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called nanocarbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherence.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, it "detaches easily from the wall," says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
WALK ON THE WALLS? –” this material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair, which self-cleanses dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and consistent adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the health risks of fruit juices whether they are, in cans or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: some patients' effects, reducing the risk of grapefruit juice and medicines.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized as being responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stem and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
RISK MEDICINAL PRODUCTS- It was the Italian Agency of medicines itself, which had given the news in a newsletter dated two years, alerting doctors and patients not to under evaluate the danger derived from this mix and to be careful what one drinks, if one takes medications such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT JUST PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: "These findings are generally immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will have to change the information notes of the drugs if necessary.
It is always necessary to read the illustrations of the medicines you take, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to address clearly to the doctor or pharmacist ", stressed the expert to the agency Ansa.
Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article published in the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked many controversies, and which was reproached to the economist for years, but which has now proved accurate.
“I’m surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "highly valued economist", but also a very aggressive publicist, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the release day of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work, carried out by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the interface revised and become less austere, to others more important, such as the compatibility born for the operating system Apple Mac OS X, and the support for the new ODF format.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphics module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that join the typical Adobe format graph to the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes, in the development of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition during the review phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is in addition to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread it in the homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office the suite tries the great challenge, can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consulting and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Objective for 2008, reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
Another case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily newspaper L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation EPO, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl’s specimens are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation EPO, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, taking the polka dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES WANTS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times is interested in, which dedicated a long article debating the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where there is "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Northern League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
A trend highlighted by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin have to bear - explains the head of the design office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the strong demand from students has distorted the market so much that a process of generalized increase has started for them.
In most cases, the lease offers also include a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, without limit of rent, sub-leases.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of taxation are needed to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, it goes from 650 euros minimum (Black Strip area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
One can only save if one moves away in the peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed you need 300/400 euros, for a single, you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for a bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by non-community students, have a subsequent anomaly: the rent demanded from foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities elect the historic rooms.
Historic movie theaters close in favor of multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-showrooms, and the consuming death of mono-showrooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems inescapable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and full of memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of the way and so many emotions" observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of a jury of Cannes, and who told the story of our life.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the cinemas of the main cities that have paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia-Romagna is at the forefront with 82 mono theaters lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-screen cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian farming has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of credit in favor of merchants: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect the existing laws.
To support the sector, between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million per year would be needed.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation thanks to the signing of a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote mono-room cinemas in the historic centers and on the outskirts.
Among the planned regulations, there are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
It is obvious, however, that to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve sound and image quality, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Cinema Paradiso" which I had already been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much shared emotions, I turn to the other side to not see the panels blackened by dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
The magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria are making heavy accusations against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controllers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already sentenced for association of criminals of the mafia type, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral regulations, and above all common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges - to enter officially inside the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Ndrangheta, heroes who are honest.
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, following which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the SVP at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a centre-right coalition, after the ballot in May 2006.
He shouted at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having plotted the whole thing for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PM writes, emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from the waves, now the big ones are launched.
This is an oversized deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have set their eyes, and now try to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmentalists and the new increase in oil are giving a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore swell operating systems.
This would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides.
Colossians on the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in the north of Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it looked like a real revolutionary step.
Two years ago, more and more candidates among these companies dedicated to traditional energy are betting on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesperson for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating the possibilities of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the US Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that precisely in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which run the way of energy from the sea, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are unknown, indicate increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, due to the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, one must use technologies with a superior environmental impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the sludge to move up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
At the moment, we have four such systems in the design phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a mall and parking lot using six submarine turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of the water during the tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, deserves right now, the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, invested $7.5 million in 2008 and forecast investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
