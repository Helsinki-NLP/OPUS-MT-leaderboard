UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year-old conflict and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet this month with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present on the council — the United States, Russia, China, England and France — on the sidelines of the General Assembly’s ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban regretted that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unresolved".
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they showed when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from polls that show Donald Trump has a real chance
Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
Others are waiting for the implosion.
But regardless of how some Republicans try to topple Donald Trump, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads by a double-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to seriously question what this means for the real estate mogul’s chances of appointment.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the Republican nomination race.
Pundits says that in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's lead made way for Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard in the general elections are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump’s power and start backing him with money.
The following are some figures from recent surveys that suggest that real estate moguls are not just transient:
The numbers indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Six out of ten Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be “excited” or “thanks” if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two in 10 say they would be “angry” if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be “enthusiastic” versus 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unhappy” or “angry” if favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
We find the same numbers in Iowa, where 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to lead, according to a Quinnipiac poll last week.
Still, 44% say they don’t have the personality to act effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say their temperament doesn’t belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, when asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Complete information: In the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four in 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that a majority of GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans have retreated to another candidate. Trump is still at the forefront of all.
Some voices say the divided situation is likely to contribute to Trump’s victory, while support against Trump will be divided among more than twelve candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush and 33 points behind Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one confrontation.
The majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they will not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their minds.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump’s most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but he’s twice as likely as voters who say they’ve decided to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of his 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic style will lead to a split between major Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
But according to the ABC/Post poll on Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
So it seems that as long as the issue of immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, largely because of their status as outsiders.
According to the ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of Republicans in the Congress, with 54 percent saying they are “unhappy” and 21 percent “highly nervous.”
Jeremy Corbyn makes his Prime Minister's Questions debut
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his Prime Minister's Questions debut, confronting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will be addressing the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance is likely to be closely analysed by the media and Labour MPs.
In his weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more facts".
He also said that he could give up a few participations and give them up to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in a leadership position, coming after he appointed a "ghost cabinet" and after his speech Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to keep quiet at a national anthem service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain drew criticism from conservative lawmakers and made headlines.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Corbyn said he had "respectfully kept silent" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the shadow cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing for differences of opinion on the economy, defense and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that policy differences in the Labour Party "cumulate" after Mr Corbyn's appointment regarding his position on the European Union and the benefits limit.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely remove the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party was "very clear" in its exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "head" level from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced on the rostrum in the last decade since taking over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from outside sources" for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North said PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and will refrain from retorts and attacks, pledging instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges young people face.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, would take his place at PMQs when he could not attend - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took office, Cameron said he wanted to give up the "Punch and Judy" political style often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he runs the House of Representatives and his position among fellow parliamentarians, although critics say it has become a caricature and needs profound reform.
‘Framework in Joburg’: Homeless young people benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as children found a way to learn a trade and make a living.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas they live in and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports chief says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in the UK could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But that purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the higher costs for the workforce within the firm, he says.
The costs could impact JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim in the "storm" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves rather words of praise and not criticism, in the opinion of Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often referred to as "Special Ks," was unpleasantly dragged into the limelight by Kyrgios' outrageous skidding against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fierce qualifying match played shortly thereafter in Cincinnati, the chair umpire had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison stated, "Wawrinka should have knocked Kyrgios down, and I should have knocked him down on the rifle."
Although he was last seen making a rocket dust after having muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
“One thing I feel strong about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a bit into the conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because of accusing cramps in the US, but he’s not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn’t be proud of that.
But let’s face it, he’s handled pretty challenging situations in the U.S. with Harrison and so forth, and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He has a great team, a great family, and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and has integrated into the team, he has not had any conflict with the other players, he is very respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in excellent shape, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged exclusively on the basis of his qualities and defects.
Healy also supported Kyrgios' decision not to consider Kyrgios for the important draw, which begins on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the long-term return of the Canberra-born player to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very fast, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs to reflect as much as he can on the team and not be in the center of it.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nationwide candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now backed by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is backed by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton supporters are more steadfast in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percentages.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has diminished.
Support among men has declined considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still at the forefront of senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a double-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the nation’s Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because they represent the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton’s current supporters will be excited about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the first-ranked Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question about why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
Agreement on these issues and eligibility are also mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although one-third believe they should not run.
When asked about the second option for the party representative, Democratic voters call Biden a majority.
More than half of Clinton supporters say Biden would be the second option, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn’t run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the most likely candidate to win the general election; but the numbers have fallen from 78% last month.
Biden is in second place but the percentage that he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer problems over eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in terms of a few key characteristics compared to their party’s primary voters.
The majority of voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trustworthy and have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strong point is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrity and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say that about Sanders (15%), but 27% have no opinion of him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
On all these points, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions persist about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and server while she was secretary of state, most Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation on the subject and say it has not affected their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the issue was divided in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their minds to the negative.
Most Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their minds about Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton to be integrity and trustworthy, this continues to raise problems among voters at a general level: only 32% consider her integrity and trustworthy, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it integrity and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of voters nationwide do not consider Trump integrity and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders to be integrity is higher than those who do not, but, as in Carson’s case, many do not have an opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Murdering Student in Year 1 at Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed taking him to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put a 14-kilogram backpack full of sand in his back and repeatedly bruised as he tried to head for a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call the emergency number after he passed out and claim he waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
But they found the time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national brotherhood president, to seek his advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, members have started hiding personal belongings and practically put the good of the brotherhood before the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trunk and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by brotherhood rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family's lawyer, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable and this action taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe District Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with contempt and complicity in murder.
“We want to hold accountable not only the people involved, but if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable,” Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch Faculty banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
The interest rate will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will enter a recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will be and how long it will take.
In economics, history offers little clue to timeliness.
After the first interest rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when the interest rate starts to rise but on the trajectory of the time it takes to normalize.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in the game.
But in the end, market players might find that all the turmoil about raising the interest rate has been exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first interest rate hike after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of ‘cheap money,’” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
However, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Below we present how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, anticipating interest rate rises can volatilize things for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a trend for capital returns to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first rise, which may again reflect monetary policy lag,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed’s rises.
Specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 percent - heading towards the interest rate increase, quite invariable in the period of 250 days after (average climb of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron Management by the strategist No.
Deutsche said the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate rise cycle and profits are starting to decline.
Recession is a reality of economic life but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will approach its historic low for a Fed interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the figure was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question “if this time is different,” Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing year-round for a growth decision by the Fed, with all eyes set on this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an interest rate increase at this meeting, futures trading indicates a probability of only 25%.
“In our study since 1950, all interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, with GDP eclipsing pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery began,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income has also been volatile given that the market expects an interest rate increase and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of equities when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the benefits change direction as soon as the first increase/decline in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate rise cycle, bond yields drop immediately,” Deutsche said.
Strategists Charles Schwab believe that these interest rate increases will bring short-term and long-term bonds closer to profitability, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds do better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing profitability," Kathy Jones, a Schwab fixed income analyst, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is straighter, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has risen – all market characteristics when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, U.S.-based companies will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the increase of the dollar will lead to the cost of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate hike,” Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rate increases by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital and low volatility stocks also outperformed similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the increase in the dollar.
Those who save might also have a win-win, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the radio station for being "foolish".
He says it is increasingly similar to the trade opponent.
He also took to the BBC Music Awards, claiming that they plagiarized the Brits awards.
Colleague Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, saying that even this show is not original
BBC Radio 3 is “transforming into” Classic FM, a senior MP said, putting pressure on the station to prove it is doing something commercial stations aren’t doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's heads that the public radio station is "foolish" and increasingly resembles the trade adversary.
“I feel like Radio 3 is ‘stupid’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I feel like it’s turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also won the BBC Music Awards last year.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be the Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different – these are the two examples that come to mind that only copy what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC CEO has denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and audience education.
I'm not gonna find out anywhere about the classical music I'm hearing from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivalled.
“In addition, I think Radio 3’s commitment to discovering new music and assigning new tracks is also important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to do more to attract audiences to the previous period because Britons had less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo criticized in the meeting of the committee of Culture, media and sports for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about the show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be done "in a BBC-specific manner."
He added that he wants the corporation to “find the golden egg hen in its own yard” the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future takeover of new seasons of The Voice or spend the money going on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest increase in August and the culprit could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month saw the slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales took off three years ago thanks to the use of mobile phones to shop.
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday could cause spending reluctance.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned UK shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August showed the lowest growth since 2000 to date, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures indicating an increase of just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to streamline over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers began using their mobile phones to shop.
This increased the number of people who could shop online and do so in various circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it’s stagnating a little, you might notice a decrease (in growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of the specialists, the buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers crammed in front of computers to get their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of many retailers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers have been fighting over bargains, could cause buyers to be reluctant.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online rather than turn to fashion stores in the shopping areas.
After Bin Laden family sanctions, Muslims bury victims killed in Mecca crane crash
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on the streets by Muslims, with the first funeral taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The health minister said a total of 394 people were injured in the crash of the crane.
In the ceremony of walking on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a collapsed crane at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those mourning their dead joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead reached the end of the final journey, at Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Osama bin Laden construction group for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
In the ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane that collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have let the crane arm up when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not disclose the details, but said the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came ahead of the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made any statements about the collapse of the crane and representatives of the Group could not be contacted for statements.
The royal decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and not coordinating its work with weather authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque in Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is carrying out major construction projects.
The last al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" son, disinherited from the family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in conditions of strong winds and rain, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Authorities have decided that the relatives of the deceased victims will receive one million Saudi riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) and the same amount will be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Others injured will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting credits into Swiss francs
On the banking market there have already been two offers to convert loans into lei in Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come over a few years, when variable interest rates can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting the loans granted by Volksbank into francs, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to the cumulative data of the analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest at 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of Bank Transilvania was accepted by 83% of customers with franc loans due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced by the amount of risk and administration commissions paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to how much they paid monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the RON credits in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from future increases of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which he receives his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no revaluation of the property, no additional guarantees and no further proof of income are required.
Basically, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the loan and there will be no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer discount at the monthly rate, compared to how much customers paid before the conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the early years consists more of interest, and the customer reimburses very little of the principal.
Bancpost offer with very low interest rate in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
It is not known how this rate will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest rates is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached the value of 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer, may also occur.
The time has come for interest rate decisions for the US Federal Reserve
The world is looking ahead to the meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters survey of 80 economists, just over half of whom believed last week that the decision would be made, I now believe the situation will hold for a while and interest rates will remain in the current 0-0.25% range.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and start a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
People who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has been going through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he battled leukemia and in 2009 he lost his lifelong partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also rumored to have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this certainly has a cost.
Manchester United’s Luke Shaw is on the run for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg in Manchester United's Champions League match, which ended with a loss to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears into the player’s eyes and will keep him on the stand for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident came after a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20, broke the defense of PSV.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
“It’s awful – a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he’s struggling, then he’s playing fantastic and now it’s happening.
The oxygen mask was put in the locker room.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor, but at double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped the red card and the concession of a penalty.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when they say it's foul and red card.
It was a very ugly intervention with two legs.
Shaw tweeted, “Thank you all for your messages, I have no words to express how weak I am, I start the road to recovery, I will come back stronger.”
Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV loss
The England defender has one more reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexico national team against the Dutch national team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when he hears that it's a very serious injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see it.
I could only see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it but I couldn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel so stupid, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an operation on behalf of Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission but still holds firm
Winning against Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task but, after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not consider a repeat defeat by 3-0 in the test matches.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a win on the road.
Perhaps Alastair Cook’s team has less experience than it did three years ago, but it has good players on the spin in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar: Adam Lyth left England for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach in Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to consider the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played all seven test matches against two good strikers under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged by their results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because – and I said that before – the players are their own selectors.
About fifty years and maybe Lyth would have prolonged his run but his fate lies in his hands.
I hope that if he does more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England’s head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when the performance wasn’t up to his ability and it doesn’t surprise me; first of all, he’s a team man.
It’s hard to answer the question of how long a battsman stands out in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and on the go.
The only dissatisfaction you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
In the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman that I rate very well.
He's a cricketer who has the "factor X" and we noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as its predecessors, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched for Moeen to open the fight with Cook, which would take extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already proven he's fucked.
Moeen may not have brought success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test 38 games as a first drop before entering the open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a back-up spinner and, although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his early age — with an average of 31 on the batting and 35 on the ball — and might think he’s dotted, but there aren’t a lot of spinners and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot from this tour.
England also made some changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they convey messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes rests for the one-day games, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and coaches do not make the program.
And you have to remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made easily.
Brexit camp could win if the economy stays calm until 2017
Every day, David Cameron’s renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets more and more confused, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy “Yes or no?” Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or TUC on Tuesday brings serious criticism to Europe.
Strangers also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last day that - plunged into crises similar to the one in the EU - not all of which are internally provoked - some member states are fueled by Britain's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they did not want this either if it eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George’s “selfie” agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for the reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain with an outward perspective under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says - suggests that several obtuse ministers and officials in certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave before her situation shakes up, as happened with Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have stayed too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to believe that they will help the posing English, whose energy would be better used to keep Scotland out of the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the style of the SNP, in the campaign for the UK referendum in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
“The renegotiation was fixed” and “the UK got nothing of value from the renegotiation.”
Europeans know for themselves how grabbing Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic press barons are who look at the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in the 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was the correspondent of Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-paying hooligans, telephone-frauding foreigners and pseudo non-domes who own the majority of major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them in much the same way, but he realized that when you’re locked in a cage with an angry gorilla, you have to give him bananas to distract him from the thought of eating lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron’s referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on the principle to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press hasn't forgiven him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on the back on Monday at Westminster – I told him to stop spending time with me – seems to be in danger of adopting the Murdoch strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of co-operation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left her vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position towards Europe is what I would indulgently call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative “Anglicism” might agree with that.
That’s what Hilary Benn said on radio and TV this week, when the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of John McDonnell as “shadow” finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his fellow Labourers, without going too far and without losing his office in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to stay "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and lawmakers at Monday night's private meeting.
Whatever image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, it made me aware - the discipline of messaging remains important in the age of television and especially in the whirlwind of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing him to take good support from Labour in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin’s basic sophism about EU membership – consistent with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his NATO sophism – Tom Watson is steadfast about the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – and there are suspicious voters there – for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The U.S. is already pretty disappointed about the British’s poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize UK Department of Public Health’s decision on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links to the tobacco industry.
The editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) has joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the UK Department of Public Health (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “baseline” report last month and described it as a “complex analysis of the evidence.”
Several researchers, however, questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinarily fragile foundation” on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned their claims and their substantiation “on solid ground or on moving sand.”
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said they expect the PHE claims that “current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed analysis of evidence and patterns.
In fact, a single meeting involving 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the adverse effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past to conduct an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated the funding received from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding reportedly received from the tobacco and cigarette company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected have not been provided, but among them are a number of well-known "leaders" in the production of e-cigarettes, some of whom even declare in the paper the financing of the industry.
Other meeting participants are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control section of the PHE.
The group's research "convincingly disguises" the lack of "solid evidence of the harmful effect of most products on most criteria," McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said the PHE claims that “so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes constitute a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, the head of the health department at the PHE, says it has responded to BMJ’s claims in the past.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One in two people who have smoked all their lives lose their lives because of this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risk of e-cigarettes is comparatively minor, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that emerges and the information that does not emerge from the evidence, in particular in view of the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
An estimated 80,000 people lose their lives each year due to a smoking-related disease, and the annual costs of smoking to the national health system reach <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion.
Clearly expressing the current evidence - namely that while the use of e-cigarettes is not risk-free, they only represent a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Advertisements that shame Britain’s arms trade
Watch the film by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones!
Beasts for smashing ankles!
Scattered bombs!
And electric sticks that cause frightening pain without leaving a trace!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world’s largest arms fair is a fierce charade, carried out by Amnesty International to underline the desire of the British authorities to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.
DSEI Arms Fair: Authoritarian Regimes Arrive in London
But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters at bus stations and subways that need a second look.
“Important announcement, are you traveling with DLR between September 15 and 18?” says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will rush into the DLR. Customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their work at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a 6-pound package of Allen keys that it says “facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stations on the planet.”
London’s transport management is not amused by this “vandalism” in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to step out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets commuters who travel by subway.
The film had more than 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP which worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who dubbed the voice also worked for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was shocked by the silence around the arms trade advertisement — with an empty space on the ExCel calendar — and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with making a more realistic ad but "enriching it with animations and strong colors, it was more striking".
“They did a great job helping us to increase interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, the UK authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the subject of the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order received from the U.S. military on “AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped warhead that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
8 Golden Rules for Living in a Home
It’s been 11 years since I moved into the home, when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but I can only now remember the forced smiles of those I annoyed — and the many complaints about others.
Most of the things we have learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring about states that range from nervous breakdown to horror.
The chatter is tempting: tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year off from school, what do you think of Corbyn and why “honestly, you don’t care Marmite because, really guys, it’s nothing but yeast extract HAHAHA, you can find me in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you wouldn’t talk to even if the flood came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
The bedrooms are often full of drink parties, movie nights and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and try on their underwear.
Similar topics: Don't even think about starting your student life in a relationship
Introverts receive special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a haven, but in many homes a culture of pervading the bedrooms is built, based on friendship, socialization, and lifelong friends.
All of this can be awful for someone trying to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to stay friends, but I want you to go away and reclaim the energy I’ve spent interacting with you.”
Try noticing when a colleague is exhausted from socializing – and try sending an SMS instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knocking on the door: do it.
A guy who lived in the same home as me had a policy that if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen enough.
Make friends by cooking.
Since you're starting college in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to get acquainted and also bring a plate of brownies, it seems less odd, less like the situation in the '50s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked you something, now smile and I ask personal questions."
Cooking at home is a great way to make friends.
Your co-workers will feel compelled to talk and may end up associating your figure with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a good cook.
Flour, sugar, and fat cuddles will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Theft of food is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you snatch someone’s chicken, it’s theft, but if you take a drop of milk to put in your tea, it’s still theft?
Ask the owner.
He will probably tell you to serve yourself even if it boils on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it’s annoying and I get it – you’re still trying to tackle the issue more maturely than my roommate, who colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
Don’t make noise that won’t let others sleep or study.
That’s not just because it’s common sense, but because you literally go on the shards.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to slow down the music because it was 3 o’clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to make the music louder.
When they finally turned off the music at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and let them sleep for two hours before the music started, locked the door and left for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if the future husband/wife moved on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extremely strange if you confused a co-worker with your future husband, you hooked up, broke up, and you should meet daily and maybe even watch him grab all the mutual friends?
Of course, you can’t resist the heart – but if a sexy co-worker is definitely not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
The thrilling moment you realize that someone has left their keys in the room unlocked, the line between prank and intimidation is thinner than it seems.
A successful prank is fun, but it can be distorted in a few moments.
Teach a fun and valuable safety lesson by hiding something – but never dirty someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but do not glue someone's goods to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: In Bach’s time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less ordinary project, quite "strange", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor and a conductor.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a Monday, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu being unavoidable.
Both performances, held on the Athenaeum stage, showed the audience a different way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 as the only classical ensemble without a conductor at the time.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, that musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentalists, not of composers.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all the musical fetishization is focused on the conductor.
And so the business, the music industry, does marketing.
So let’s not talk about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience that can’t listen, but has to watch, which is stupid again,” said David Grimal.
The violinist recounts that this change in the way he makes music came after the "musical deceptions" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and to bring money and music to the industry.
Ten years ago, when I was in my 30s, I found this very depressing, because I could no longer find creativity and human brotherhood in this system.
So, I didn't find any sense to continue on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one was doing it without a conductor: “The world of music, extremely conservative, did not want such projects.”
“How do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego anymore?” the artist asked.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be a hindrance in the musical act: "Curiosly, the more we sing a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not only in the role", Grimal maintains, adding that at the show on Sunday "we were on the 74th".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very courageous one", precisely because he also invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the largest orchestras in the world are present who also play 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you have invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and the interest for something different, which breaks down barriers.
Speaking of Enescu’s work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu’s works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu’s music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, “because there is also a George Enescu who made French music”.
Grimal advocates for a change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the craft of musician, as it is organized today, has a death knife" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don’t need to go around the world five times a year if it doesn’t help.
In Bach’s time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, releasing albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, there is no freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before you entered the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU you had to pass health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture end up in the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
Music is the same, it’s the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes maybe not too beautiful, but when we cut them they are real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with education policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things in humanity, we reintroduce its learning in school, we reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products," Grimal said.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, this is everywhere, it is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will play an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We’re talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier, it has to be somehow, if we want to train a musician, it’s totally different.
In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?” asked the French artist, smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of a different way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and that is why after the concert they come out smiling".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.

Cinema City Searches for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: dubbing two characters from the blockbuster "Snow Queen 3D"
Do you have a super talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to dub two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic drawings the emphasis was placed on the closeness of the actor's voice to the specifics of the animated character, lately, when creating the story, those who are going to interpret the voices are also taken into account, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are starting a new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
"The children will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11 to September 30, Cinema City organizes a preselection which will be chosen 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a audition in a recording studio with professionals.
All the parents have to do is access the platform smalllevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where to register the child to the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Subsequently, he must choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is about to read and then the child will record himself performing his own version of dubbing.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the event: "Yellow Feathers 3D", "Mune: Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Cowardly Koala 3D" and "Maya Bee 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will dub a character from the blockbuster "The Snow Queen - Snow Queen 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx earnings are mixed, tax forecasts fall for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, with the delivery giant lowering its full-year profit estimates as a result of low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s shares fell about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, down 20 cents, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts forecast the figure at $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The declining estimate comes despite price increases of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on January 4 and higher surcharges for the land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that "the company is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially in terms of global production and trade."
The holiday employment plans were announced a day after the UPS competitor said it plans to employ 90,000-95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number of jobs it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts responding to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
Profit increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which has led to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping jumped the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the revenues of the ground division increased by 29% but operating revenues stagnated practically due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit saw an increase in revenues due to higher core tariffs, while revenues from the freight division declined due to rising costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares were down $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
At closing on Tuesday, they were down 11% year-on-year and 17% from their record high on June 11.
At the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank’s meeting room, will be a mural of the United States.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, Fed President, and her colleagues must put the nation’s economic interests above all else.
The central bank has been given a double task by Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, to be announced on Tuesday, that will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be rid of the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in effect since the end of 2008.
Even though most data indicate a strong growing economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by raising the benchmark rate to federal funds — even by just a quarter percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will pursue,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the rising uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them a reason to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the Fed’s decision, which in itself is causing instability in the financial market.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg anticipated an interest rate hike this week.
But financial markets are expecting the Fed to postpone, with a key indicator showing the likelihood of growth at just 30 percent.
This would indicate a fall on the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policymakers would soften the blow by promising that it would take a long time for the next rise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The uptick was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising for the Fed to raise the interest rate at this time,” Lonski said.
If Fed policymakers were to do so, “they should act deeply in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets.”
Other experts said an interest rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared on track to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step toward slowing monetary tightening that would confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected an interest rate hike this year despite objections from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Salary gains showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fall short of the central bank’s annual target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them given the tension in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began fibrillating at the end of this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market declined somewhat this month, with the Dow now about 10% below its May high.
For Fed policymakers, market turmoil adds to the complex calculation of the timing of interest rate hikes.
“Without what has happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakening Chinese economy in recent weeks, we would be more firm at the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he expects that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy and they have almost no data to rely on aftermath of events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s major interests, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
The mere allusion by then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “narrow” its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials are expected to not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at wealth management firm Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that “the Fed has an overreacting history to changes in the financial market that appear to be unrelated to economic underpinnings.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported interest rate hikes, gave an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that hit Asia prompted the Fed to cut the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the limited identification implications for U.S. development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to the declines.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market quake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate board.
The latest turmoil does not rise to that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to be afraid of an interest rate hike because the markets have been upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until something changes in that regard, I don’t think it should take premature action.
Are you looking for a great market with Thai specific?
Try LAX-C from Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/depot opened/opened in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/depot is a universal store offering a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, popular Thai and Asian snacks and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is also a car section where you need to buy some engine oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to walk all the aisles.
If you get hungry from so much bought, eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The inner food district of the store (good, affordable as price) is close to the houses and offers several options of preparations that can be taken to pack.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything- Thai?
You probably find it at LAX-C.
The products have reasonable prices and some items are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat shelf is large, so is the fish shelf - the staff serving will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it if you want.
An important part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer district, where you will find curry leaves, frozen melon and ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef ball, pork carcasses, fish meatballs, traditional, semi-prepared sausages and much more.
Who buys from there: Restaurant owners and chefs, also families and individuals.
On the wide corridors fit both shopping carts and forklift carts.
Discovery: fresh Durian fruit right next to the house area.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own shared parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although there is a chance that the store will get crowded, there is usually no hard to find parking space.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite attempts by Channel Nine to broadcast on the Today Show about changing the leadership of the party
The urgent trip of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey the subject of the consequences of changes in the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of Channel Nine aired from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over several weeks, which also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "cruelty" of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase compared to Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000) but the numbers were lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all morning.
This morning, Parliament is not the only one affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main story was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could handle a show alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The audience results for last night responded resoundingly with “yes.”
The Seven's X Factor show remained in the spotlight with 1,136 million viewers, slightly ahead of The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night of broadcasting The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new general culture show averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half of the hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 and the second half had a huge audience of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia’s ratings on the second night will give Nine tacit confidence that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Since he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democracy efforts diminished.
4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into crowds demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to district police chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, some of whom threw rocks and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas and then fired shots into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces set up under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent clashes on August 10.
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a country governed centrally for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was launched in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, policemen and weapons
The Prime Minister continues the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of Wednesday’s government meeting, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm position on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or policemen with weapons.
“It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply methods from the 1930s,” Ponta said.
"The prime minister also said that all the dates and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and set out at the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the prime minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A large low-pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60% chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight-loss surgery could be helpful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight-loss surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those undergoing nonsurgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgeon, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of weight relative to height, is considered normal in the range of 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy — in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI in people who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received nonsurgical diabetes treatments remained at nearly the same level, namely 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured in 36% and partially in 28%.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured in only 1% and partially in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, controlling blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored the blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the group treated with medical methods, it was maintained at about 8%.
But this improved “glycaemic control” – reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels – did not reduce the mortality rate at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomy group in the sleeve, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), experienced more considerable decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c 7% (3.1% versus 2.1%), and had a higher probability of complete remission (16% versus 2.1%) and had a higher probability of complete remission (46).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine – Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the point at which this paper is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the group with lower BMI,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously when the patient’s BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we’re waiting too long before we’re urging people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies and predisposed them to obesity and diabetes, it’s extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not welcome all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call for an end to the violence in the refugee mother countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirably, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we must think of long-term solutions to bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush after the terrorist attacks of September 11, saying that the violent response from the US has generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 9/11, I conveyed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, U.S. anti-poison centers have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed hand detergent with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, cases of hand detergent ingestion in children under 12 years of age reported at anti-poison centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children intentionally drink detergent and others do so to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social media.
On YouTube, you can watch movies that show teenagers drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
It appears that teenagers mixed the detergent with mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
“A child doesn’t think it hurts him,” Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (of hand detergent) are the fragrant ones.
Hand detergents with the flavor of strawberries, grapes, orange are the most attractive for children.
Hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones reach them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four strawberry-flavored hand detergent sprays, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179 times higher than the threshold at which an adult is legally considered under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was murmuring and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was terrifying," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or wet wipes and to keep the hand detergent out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher by “putting antibacterial products into the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in her classroom.
The police considered the plan “insignificant” and submitted the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

The absence of the Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, now Ajax's ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands I no longer send the Celtic match summary; why?"
Because there's no Rangers in there.
It’s not just about the return of the Rangers.
It's about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s where the interest is.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and it’s not just the Scots who want to see these matches.
I will change the situation, Deila promises.
Ronny Deila accepted that Celtic was fighting hard but the Norwegian boss promised to change the situation.
Defeat to Malmo and subsequent elimination from the Champions League was followed by defeat to Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now at the top of the standings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had periods before and will recover."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel the same way, but we need to move forward.
We really need the support of Celtic because that’s how the players get better.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton's Prudence on January Transfers
Despite comments a few weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some targets for January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he does not want to affect the Ibrox unit.
The former head of Brentford said: "The transfer period in January is very different from the one in the summer."
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is the period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you may have noticed this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players who are not needed.
Celtic target Michu after retirement
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he could withdraw at the end of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled with ankle problems for two years and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts clash with SFA over Neilson comments
The Hearts were leading 2–1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3–2, but the defender's red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his remarks, insisting, "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was caught in the act after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 at a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh ahead of a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment," the striker said, adding: "No need to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I'm playing for Celtic."
Tannadice Council Trusts Dundee United - Donnelly Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still trusts that the management team will change the situation - but agrees that the decline on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy for 'dirty victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must desperately cling to Hamilton Accies to secure their seventh successive league win, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic due to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or the league, and that has not won games like that."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as UK rises
Scotland’s unemployment rate remained unchanged, at 164,000 in May-July, while the number of unemployed in the UK overall rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that in the UK, at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term plan of the authorities has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the Scottish labour market, with the employment rate rising and the unemployment rate decreasing.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch as a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit in an observer's room in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary's execution room and watch Richard Glossip be executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I am terrified of the idea.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole death penalty story.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can witness executions in America, and because applications usually exceed the number of seats available, a macabre lottery is held to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The elect will look at the execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, in addition to developing my own connection with him through months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wants it, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that "he could have formulated it better", but he still believes they are wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it if he asked me to.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants to have an international report on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we have done.
I will not go back here to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's very likely not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I will watch him die from this perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to watch a man I like die uselessly.
Peter Moody claims that the Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from the races
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victoria stewards tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the races.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass was the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to treatment given on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do the best for racing and is put in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidari’s positive cobalt test result, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about spy statements and did not want to resemble "the fox that does not reach the grapes".
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that and I’ve been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get so frustrated that it all buzzes all of a sudden,” Moody said.
It is known that it continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have declared.
Tonight I will go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go upside down and I want the owners I work with to see that I’m striving to give them the best.
From the moment they start to believe that this is not the case, I have to give up the job of trainer.
At that point I will have to think about what I will do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man – whose name I will name if asked – and they offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he considers me a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to start having a backbone and be able to hold people outside the trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe that's how others see it.
Maybe they have to take my license and put me aside, and I have no doubt that the statements I am making now might cause them to think about this.
But I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t care anymore and that saddens me.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on them and get them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can go.
The frustration of the trainer increased with the lengthy investigation into the cobalt test involving Lidari and the elimination led him to say that he could “put his license on the table.”
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training the undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the day-of-race treatment rule “ridiculous” after applying a sludge or clay poultice to horses’ legs, breaking the rules.
He's breaking the racing rules.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on their feet.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on the day of the race consisting of the application of the poultice, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram has been arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by fleeing the crash site.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he was seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to Shepparton police.
He will be charged with running away from the scene of the accident, not providing first aid and other road crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized, in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to his opponents on wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the tackle tactics used by his team "distorted subjects" brought up by the top two NRL favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm players to "hit it" in Storm's nervous win in Friday night's qualifying final in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in to defend the tackle tactics approached by his team and stated that the players simply focused on "contact" when they tackled.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two top coaches criticized his team, meaning they were worried that Storm would beat them.
“And things don’t stop there — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything all year long in our defensive systems or techniques, only that in the last six weeks we’ve really put the emphasis on touch in tackles and so we’ve changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so he’s probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his mentor St. George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett's winning the championship in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and talked about how exciting the game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism because they were a boring team and Wayne said he didn’t care as much as black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider to be exciting football, especially thanks to the fast young midfielders.
This kind of game you want to do when you have players like that.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat worried about the match with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn’t think about us when they thought about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a tougher score-related match than the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, we haven’t seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, does that mean exciting game?
Or is it exciting to take breaks and not score?
It's plans for me.
If they're talking about us, it means that at some point we might meet them.
Storm is free this weekend as they won the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in Saturday's qualifying final at AAMI Park, with tickets on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used girls' phones to trick pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as the subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
He looked at his phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
Upon arrival, police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at that address and found “worrying” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed to have done so to “attract pedophiles” on the Internet before “pretending to be a cop to scare them off.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: “He said it’s an addiction – that he’s addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to pose as a policeman to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the stranger who sent him the pictures and about asking the stranger to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to entice.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and that he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: “When the little girl found the messages on her phone, she yelled at her mother and she was shaking and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant was using the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, Hogg, a 23-year-old resident of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to taking or taking indecent pictures of child subjects, and violated the conditions of his parole on January 25 this year, and failed to appear in court at his March 24 appearance this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be registered in the sex offenders’ registry because it can be said that this crime “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, on grounds of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody before appearances for other cases.
It was put on the sex offenders' register before the sentence was handed down.
Robert Mugabe, the President of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on a podium ladder.
He was not hurt but the footage of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they had received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to boo Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament – a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number but it’s titled ‘death,’” he told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the parliamentarians concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the threats sent to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 redundancies
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company’s efforts to restructure and cut costs in the service sector.
This year, HP will split into two companies, separating its computer and printer division from its rapidly growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected layoffs will cost about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP currently and will have a broad business portfolio that will help companies transition to the new business style,” said Whitman.
Working as a separate company, we are better than ever positioned to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and “focus on delivering unrivalled integrated solutions” to companies.
The company was founded in 1930 by Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage was called the "Silicon Valley Cradle".
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to adapt to the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the industry, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching their peak in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wishing to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle for the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood,” their chances of recovery double.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders by half.
Of course, for friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In this age of social media-dominated communication, where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is what dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values — our inner desire for personal development and friendship — that further affect our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn’t really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it drew attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed through interaction as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the moments when they watch football in their comfortable armchairs, and Ross’s passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even though they often shy away from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me, “my role in listening to suicidal and depressed people has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who turn to us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to deal with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms of psychological adaptation in the long term.
The show highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, external intervention helps, through the phone, people reached in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you are attending this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with full playback of the set to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends for a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG put Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut on Tuesday and helped PSG win against Sweden's Malmo.
The following is the chronicle of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League group series with a reassuring 2-0 win over Malmo in Tuesday's match at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his Champions League debut for PSG, bringing the French champions to the fore despite missing a number of opportunities before securing his lead with Cavani's goal in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the optimums but also to improve the course to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
But despite taking the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the goal opportunity after which he was replaced by the team from his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and makes a comfortable difference to the next rankings, even if there are still aspects that we need to perfect throughout the season,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I’m sorry we couldn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury to one of the three changes to the team in Paris, with a 2-2 draw for Bordeaux at home in Ligue 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he sprang to Marco Verratti’s pass behind Malmo’s defense before kicking unbelievably over Johan Wiland in the long corner on the right of the goal.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine starters to national teams, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, with the exception of Nikola Djurdjic, who passed Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute.
Instead, the PSG players slowed down a few times, giving a few unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game resumed.
However, Ibrahimovic proved to be much better at supporting his teammates, his goal being the one Di Maria sent in a deflected kick by Wiland over the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in the final after one hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's goal.
This goal eliminated the hope of Malmo that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop by Wiland from the distance for rejection David Luiz maintained the final score before newcomer Ezequiel Lavezzi was cancelled a goal in extra time.
Norwegian coach Age Hareide later stated that PSG were one class over and that "The last match we played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, I have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
The qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodities exchange, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a comprehensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off the debt.
After losing 57 percent of its market value this year, the company is struggling with falling commodity prices because China’s downturn in economic activity is influencing demand and causing disaster in markets.
The preferential right of subscription raised the price of Glencore shares on the London stock exchange in trades on Wednesday morning.
Shares rose 2.77% to 131.60 shillings on the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a 0.69% higher value.
Glencore has revealed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 shillings per share, down 2.4% from Tuesday’s closing price.
It took out 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concerns about the growth of China’s stagnating economy led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi urges broader expansion of global economy
President Xi Jinping told a reform group on Tuesday that the economy needed to open up to the outside world to fuel growth.
“China must commit to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve openness policies,” Xi said at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and give way to economic growth, Xi said.
The steering group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list regulating market access, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganizing the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying the sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and providing a broader market opening.
The state authorities will also weaken controls over the powers it delegates to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be open to private investment.
“State authorities will not change their policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called ‘green cards’, optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions dissatisfied with the government’s proposal to increase wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the education unions have not reached any result, the Government proposing a 10% salary increase from December 1st, with payment on January 1st, 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase from November, or a 20% increase from December.
The talks took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister accompanied by Education Minister Sorin Cimpeanu, Finance Minister Eugen Teodorovici and Labour Minister Rovana Plumb.
Today’s Government proposal did not satisfy us, in fact we would not have been in the position to convene the leadership of our federations.
The 10% that we are promised today is less for us than we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have.
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI in which the representatives of the Government will also attend to present to the representatives of the confederations of the country the proposal of salary increase, following that the unionists will decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The prime minister also told unionists that the government is trying to send the wage bill to parliament as soon as possible so that it can come into force on December 1.
In the normative act it is foreseen to increase the salaries of the educational system with 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase foreseen in the document to be made staggered, in the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the unionists to acquit all judgement in 2016.
Migrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkish waters on Tuesday after their boat sank.
The victims included 11 women and five children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and was heading for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard said it had rescued 249 people in the shipwreck, but their nationality was not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Over the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the ship was carrying more people than its capacity, so it was shipwrecked.
The route has become a popular one lately for migrants who want to escape war and hardship from countries like Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired because they were too fat
Air India is laying off about 130 stewards and stewardesses because they are overweight, the airline said late last week.
The company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "ridiculous" and "sexist shocker."
The mass redundancies are the latest in a ten-year struggle between the company and the busiest stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began using graphs with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India dismissed nine flight attendants who were considered "exceptionally overweight" because this "can have an effect on reflexes and prevent the agility required to carry out emergency measures".
The stewardesses sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
“All efforts to cause them to lose weight have failed,” a company spokesman said.
A footballer from the Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision he made
A footballer from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali regarding the promotion of young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, quarterback Paul Papp opened a football school.
The Academy "Paul Papp" will operate in the city of Dej, the local deserters are waiting for a first selection action.
I am extremely happy to have reached this stage, to start the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it’s extremely important to find talented kids who can play football without worrying about training materials.
They must have only one care: to play football as well as possible.
Technical details don’t have to be their concern.
They need to showcase their talent.
This is what he wants to do 'Paul Papp' Football Academy.
"I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show them that he is with them," footballer Papp told dejeanul.ro.
At the Academy of the star defender are expected children up to 11 years old.
The whole party wants to govern.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the entire party wants to remain in government, and, if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we want to formalize through a Congressional decision, we will do the same.
There won't be any emotion about that.
"There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that give someone the insecurity of the government or that give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the meeting of the National Permanent Bureau of the PSD.
PSD has announced when it will congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, in the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, a clear message be given if the continuation of the government is desired or if the party decides to move to the opposition.
I’ll let you know on Monday if I’m running for Congress.
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for a leadership position in the next Congress.
I will sing on Monday after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is set.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD's National Permanent Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation about announcing the candidacy is related to his file, Dragnea said he did not have this problem.
I do not have the issue you are referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce or not to announce a candidacy when the date of the Congress is formally set.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of Social Democratic branches proposed the extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party’s Executive Committee.

An Italian was caught at Bors customs with immigrants hidden in the TIR
Two Sri Lankans were spotted Monday at Bors customs as they tried to cross the border illegally, hiding in the semi-trailer of a freighter led by an Italian citizen.
After the investigation, it was established that the two had paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the Border Police informs.
At the specific control, border guards noticed, in the cab of the truck, a large travel bag, in which were personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough check on the means of transport.
On this occasion, border police discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the freighter, among the plastic crates, two male persons.
The verifications showed that the individuals in question, two men, aged 28, are Sri Lankan citizens and asylum seekers in Romania.
“In the research, the young people stated that they intended to arrive in France, which is why they contacted a compatriot, through whom they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they were to receive 2,000 euros per person,” the border police said in a statement.
The two migrants were charged with “criminal work in the area of committing the crime of attempted fraudulent crossing of the state border”.
Also, Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian citizen who was driving a Renault Magnum truck, registered in Romania, carrying plastic boxes for a company in Italy, was detained for 24 hours, to be presented to the Bihor Tribunal with a proposal for pre-trial arrest.
How Satisfied Romans Are in Couples: Men versus Women
Most Americans are happy with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study carried out on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents said they were “very satisfied” and “satisfied” with the overall quality of the relationship.
“However, 18% of the respondents indicated they were ‘slightly unsatisfied’ and ‘very unsatisfied’ in the relationship, and another 18% said they were ‘proper,’” the study concluded.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% appropriate, 6% very unsatisfied and 8% slightly unsatisfied.
As for women, 33% said they were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very unsatisfied, 14% slightly unsatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
In terms of the neutral (fit) state, we see a difference of two percent.
"As well as in the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference being the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent," the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
“Romans feel they need a little more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), security (20%), nine (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, confidence 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-control 10%.”
The study was carried out by Extreme Training between June 1 and September 1,369 people, with a margin of error of 2.6%.
Europe is once again in disgrace.
German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe had "been embarrassed" after Monday's failure of a ministerial meeting in Brussels on the distribution of refugees within the European Union.

Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere had suggested cutting EU structural funds in the case of countries that reject refugee quotas.
The European interior ministers, meeting on Monday in Brussels, failed to reach an agreement on the compulsory distribution of 120,000 refugees, called for last week by the European Commission to deal with one of the worst migratory crises in Europe since 1945.

What Happened to Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep faces a crucial decision for her career as she has to choose whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year as part of the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian coach being alongside the novelist only in major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself in front of the capricious sportsman.
However, the Adidas program will end later this year, and Halep has to decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or give up the collaboration.
We still don't know exactly what's going to happen.
We talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer," Simona told a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, requesting a contract of about $1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession that he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last event that Simona and Cahill will work on together is the Singapore Tournament of Champions.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania’s national team last autumn.
The former manager confessed that he did not get along with FRF president Razvan Burleanu after he took over from Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national team.
Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but was refused.
I’m not sorry that I left the country at the moment.
Then I was sorry, I was leaving a job behind.
That’s how I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector was not normal, I was not respected, my work was not respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he did not know me, he finds out different opinions in the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation was in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to leave.
If they wanted me to stay, I offered them a contract extension.
We have about 400 and some thousands of euros a year, I was going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn’t talk to Burleanu, I talked to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group," said Victor Piturca at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last fall, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 qualifying.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the group Al Ittihad.
Armored and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns to the Serbian border after violent clashes on Wednesday, when water cannons and tear gas were used against migrants who wanted to enter from Serbia, despite Hungary having erected a barbed wire fence.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in the clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far 20 policemen have been injured and the ambulance service has picked up two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect the security of Hungary by any means," Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi said.
The police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas the crowd of people throwing plastic bottles, stones and pieces of floor.
Authorities reported that dozens of migrants broke the fence at the crossing between the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto urged Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants at the border.
There are reports that the Serbs have supplemented their law enforcement forces at the border.
Following Wednesday’s incidents, Budapest suspended the crossing of the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted effort to close its borders to prevent migrants from entering the country.
If on Tuesday he announced that besides the barbed wire fence at the border with Serbia he will also raise one at the border with Romania, towards the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the construction of a fence at the border with Croatia.
A rare disease that a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was drunk, he could barely stand on his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he had not consumed alcohol, it was apparent that he was drunk.
When she first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought, 'Maybe he's drinking alone, he's an alcoholic in secret,'" he said.
When he saw the footage of his wife with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, simply did not recognize himself: “I was looking into my eyes and I wasn’t there.”
'It was awful, I couldn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although she doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick’s breath smelled of alcohol.
The moment that put Nick on his mind was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had an alcohol level three times above the legal limit, although the night before he had only drunk one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, your body causes all the carbohydrates you consume to ferment, turning it into alcohol.
The one who suspected this could be Nick's disease was his wife.
The disease doesn’t have a cure yet, but since giving up carbs, Nick hasn’t had such episodes.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest at the services he received from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be taken out of use, BT reports.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video went on the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car had faults that endangered his life and that of his family.
His annoyance came when the dealer from whom he purchased the car did not solve his problem, as they had agreed.
The government approved on Wednesday the "National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is going through as part of the efforts to modernize the process of managing immigration on national territory", according to a press release.
The strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and policy directions that reflect policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
Considering the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are considered for the unitary and coherent management of the situations determined by the possible occurrence of an influx of illegal immigrants into Romania, generated by political, social, economic or military crisis situations.
"The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay particular attention to citizens from states with migratory potential or that may harm national security," the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls of the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the territory of Romania for third-country nationals who meet employment needs, facilitating access for third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for the fields and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers that it is "a means by which concrete activities are established that lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon".
Romania, in a European top on the labor market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in total labour costs among EU Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employers' personnel expenses.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total labour cost rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania ranks third in the EU at rising labour cost
The highest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly labour cost fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The increase in labour costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly labour cost in industry and services, with 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labour cost.
Activity report of TVR management, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
The Culture Committees of the Parliament rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
Seventeen MPs voted against the report, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the meeting of the Permanent Bureaus.
They will decide, probably next week.
The next plenary session will be held.
"I think given this situation it will be done relatively quickly," said the chairman of the Senate Culture Committee, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" for the TVR leadership to be present at this meeting, given that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Commissions.
It was common sense for the TVR leadership to be present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members since last night, with an approximate hour that we did not know the time either, but today, after the meeting of the Bureaux, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I believe that at the moment you are summoned, you are a budgetary employee, paid from public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the assembled committees even if you do not like it alive.
“Because it’s your duty, you’re in an institution subordinated to Parliament,” Severin said after the meeting of the Parliament’s culture committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw as they continued, it came with the idea that this year would be up to date, but they were not paid from the historical ones.
"I would remind you that it is not my fault or that of any of these committees that the bank and the tax have been lost, there are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the assembled plenary there will be elections for a new Board of Directors, and this will elect the general director of the institution.
I don’t know who will be nominated for this position.
Miracles will not be done.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to work.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will be a genius who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, through their vote, will choose with great reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what is going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don’t know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities I have to have – good sense in the attitude towards employees because it’s a bunch of petitions that come from employees, complaints, layoffs.
“When you get 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster,” he said.
Although he did not present himself to the Parliament, the president-director general of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he requested that the Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and guaranteeing the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of the TV fee.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to indexing the TV fee, to amend and supplement HG 978/2003 on the public service television fee, in order to update the provisions at the level of up-to-date technological changes, as well as to regulate the procedure on the control of the payment of the TV fee and the finding of contraventions and the application of penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become representatives of SRTv for the collection of the TV fee, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission in receipts.
Stelian Tanase asks to reduce the VAT rate for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for the CNC from 15% to 3%, but also to amend Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budget / financial allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sports events - World Cup Football, Golden Deer, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will go into inability to pay in the coming months given that the labor legislation obliges the employer to enforce the judgments, even if they are not final, and wage rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenses with staff and TV production.
“Thus travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a series of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News station was closed,” reads the letter from the TVR president.
Tanase believes that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied by one’s own efforts alone.
"Without the support of the state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to carry out its public mission," the letter states.
The management of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
The son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, sent to trial
Vasile Blaga’s son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was brought to trial on Wednesday by prosecutors of the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a case with damages of about 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, together with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigations revealed that, in order to evade the payment of taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specialized in providing security services would have created an criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
“In fact, fictitious purchases of services would have been recorded in the company’s accounts, which, in reality, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros,” the Romanian Police said in a press release.
The sheiks have determined the fate of Sanmartean
The sheikhs of the Al-Ittihad club have determined the fate of the midfielder Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that the separation of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, the manager of coach Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the starting match match and does it well.
The sheiks also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up on him.
There would have been the option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been more talks, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has come to fruition," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was elected Vice President at the Court of Auditors
The plenary of Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were registered "for" and 108 "against".
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, informs Digi24.
Moreover, the liberals have criticized the appointment of Sarbu in this position and announced that they will challenge it to the CCR, in the conditions that he has a file with the DNA, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position at the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do more politics.
The PSD senator will hold the position of vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, which remained free after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is about to play a chef in the movie “Burnt,” the actor made a reveal that his fans didn’t expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up in the kitchen: "I've worked most of my life as a chef."
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen since the age of 15, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, before then, in college, he continued on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so his entire childhood was cooking with his Italian grandmother.
Asked what his future plans were at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the kind of man to make five-year plans, "not even two."
“It’s not at all motivating for me to have a map,” he said.
“I have dreams, things that you would laugh at if I told you,” he said, adding that what he had wanted since childhood had come true.
At the age of 40, the actor admitted that he could see himself directing in the near future, taking on the role of Clint Eastwood, who also began directing at this age.
Ponta accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational statements
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Wednesday sharply condemned Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta’s remarks that Hungary’s political decision-makers are “nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing.”
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational statements, insults the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has totally lost his support in domestic politics in Romania," the head of Hungarian diplomacy added, according to MTI.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" Ponta said on Facebook.
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he is a proponent of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, estimating that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will just look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are no better political decision makers than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all in the superiority of European values - what we see in Hungary in recent days is in total contradiction precisely with these objectives and values!"
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks about Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis as "simple lies" and said they were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the "extremist and lying remarks" of the Romanian prime minister are related to the internal political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest is waiting for apologies from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and always say is that I am against xenophobic discourse the idea of closing the borders, as all those who come are terrorists, they are stupid of the Middle Ages and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can receive more, we will receive, the problem is our logistical capacity to treat those people as people, not as our Hungarian neighbors treat them with bats and inserts.
“I don’t agree with that,” the head of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest has decided to begin field preparations for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Afterwards, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to erect a fence on the border did not solve anything of the refugee problem and "take Hungary out of Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the crane in Mecca?
Saudi authorities have said the Saudi binladin group, which belongs to Osama bin Laden’s family, is “partially responsible” for the crash of a crane on Friday on the Great Mosque in Mecca, which killed 107 people.
According to a committee of inquiry, the company did not "comply with safety rules", the Saudi news agency (SPA) reported.
The company’s directors were forbidden to leave the country until the investigation in this case was completed.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former leader of the terrorist network Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is now run by former terrorist leader Bakr’s brother.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years to expand the Great Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred during a storm on Friday night when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong wind gusts, collapsed on the eastern side of the roof of the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How he closed the mouths of the protesters
Considered by many people the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after his retirement, as a weak coach, who may not be able to perform in the new posture.
After unhappy experiences with the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Viitorul Constanta, the team he sponsors.
Exactly one year after taking over the team, the King has shown that he is capable of turning a struggling team from demotion to a top-notch one.
Thus, after a year, Viitorul recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, fighting in European cups.
Things took an even better turn for the Future this season, as the team came in second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (tie with Astra), more than double the Star.
On the other hand, although he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and lately in the starting team there have appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has made the Future a follow-up team for foreign teams, so Hagi sold this summer for 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Along with Star, Futurul is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played like a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated like the EU’s seventh country.
The big countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the governing body of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come."
But there are masses that have started and we cannot turn history around.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as well as possible and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment, in which politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation of now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council which, in fact, has solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the prognoses said that he would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the JHA applied the principle of unanimity and any state could block any decision.
This is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, is applied, and the council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said that the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go forward.
Because it is a sensitive issue, reactions of rejection have arisen in Germany itself against Chancellor Merkel’s policy of opening up and they did not want it to appear in many countries as a reaction of the type “the EU sends migrants to our heads”.
They have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governance and we will probably see big changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory odds weren’t really eliminated, but the subject was just let cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of the external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece’s border with Turkey is also Germany’s de facto border with Turkey, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be waived, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece capsizes, you can’t say indefinitely that it’s Greece’s business.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is it possible to solve it without a precise, perhaps even compulsory, mechanism for sharing the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work if they are reached.
Because there remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think the European states will start taking up migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It is likely that there will be some unique filtering centres in Greece or Turkey where asylum applications can be processed.
They are working on solutions like this.
But the problem does not have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the migrant problem will increase the xenophobic current.
The truth is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have been able to leave, winter is hard to pass the Mediterranean, but we expect next year a wave maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will not look at it as catastrophic from a media point of view.
You were talking about countries with less or more experience.
Do you think there is a place where large groups from a culture outside Europe have really succeeded in integrating?
I'm looking at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go for radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that doesn’t mean they don’t integrate at all.
It remains an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in Britain.
But purely police means won't work.
Let's create the fortress of Europe and the illusion.
Mechanisms of integration into European societies must be addressed.
There were some mistakes here.
We have to be more pretentious.
Let’s ask these people to learn the language, to try to take over the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and with one in their home country, bringing the rest of the family including through marriages of convenience.
But the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it doesn’t mean we have to look at them drowning in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come.
And if there’s going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don’t believe, it doesn’t mean that the country will be rebuilt overnight and you can bring them back.
Until solutions emerge, we see strength within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls are being erected, border controls are being reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project at risk?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too great on the countries in which these migrants set foot for the first time.
I mean, we're moving around freely, but everyone's got their own problems.
In the face of such a wave it cannot be so, because some countries do not cope.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they’re doing something, but in the long run, that doesn’t change much.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we did last year.
There is a wave of public emotion that is settling in both directions.
And it’s so unstable from week to week that you can’t make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion is thrilled.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real European market.
And I don’t think Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the current situation.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
As a small country, who thinks that if he pulls the cap over his eyes and plugs his ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it’s not your small country’s problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the EU's seventh country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
The big countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romanians for Schengen will decrease greatly.
President Iohannis says that it is perhaps good that we have not already entered.
So we move from desperate entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen so that migrants see us as an alternative route.
This does not mean that it is a reason not to enter Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that the external borders will become common responsibility, there will be unique rules of acceptance of migrants, unique rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia turned its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two foci, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means confusing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial efforts of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed a long time ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
About two years ago there was a fight between the Assad regime and the moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State arose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates foci of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you are great power only if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to gain time.
Probably Putin is waiting for offers to be made, for him to press the buttons to resolve the situation.
Offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can solve in one way or another issues created by him.
But I don't agree with theories that these people are being held by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, that of "Dislike".
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, informs the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the “Dislike” button would show a nuance of what a user feels rather than just an option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wants to avoid moments when someone posts on his account about an important event in his life, and someone else will “dislike” it.
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long demanded to have the opportunity to express negative emotions or empathize with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said it was not very comfortable for people to "like" current events, such as the refugee crisis or the death of a family member.
“You may not feel comfortable liking that post,” the Facebook spokesperson said.
The new Facebook button has not been well received by everyone.
“There is already enough hatred on Facebook and social media,” Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan said on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article on the topic was posted.
"I'm going to 'dislike' the 'dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, has argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it was hard to imagine that a single button could transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees have entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary on Tuesday accepted only 70 migrants, a handful of thousands coming en masse to its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence on its border with Romania, the DPA recalls.
The move attracted a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian Refugee Minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The "new" seat of the County Council is about to fall.
Two builders in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The seat of the County Council on Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up falling apart on its own.
A year and a half after the works of consolidation and reusability of the building should have been completed, the works have not reached even half.
A final stage in the epic of the building was consummated last days, when the National Council for the Resolution of Disputes (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract to carry out the technical project for the works that are still to be executed.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of a contract notice with Impex Romcatel, the company will update the technical project, and then a new auction for the works will be organized.
"Negotiations did not end with a contract, however, the CJ estimating that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution," summarized R<0xC4><0x83>zvan Timofciuc, public relations representative at the CJ.
The decision of the CJ to interrupt direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of Iasi sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it, as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility of appealing the CNSC decision to the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment of it can be considered to find another designer.
As a result, the construction of the building could be resumed early next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the reworking of the technical project should not take long, but we must arrive at the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work on the consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Department began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The tender was resumed and the contract was awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
So far, about 50% of the work has been done.
Initially, the works of consolidation, refurbishment and atticing of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"Okay, I say everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of Cadastro
One of the employees involved in the scandalous Cadastre Office file signed an agreement to recognize the facts, against deferred imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, led by the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
An adviser from the Office of Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Ia<0xC8><0x99>i accused of DNA in a corruption case acknowledged his telefap.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was registered yesterday at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Tribunal, the judges agreeing to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was accused of continuous intellectual forgery and agreed to carry out two years of deferred detention, as well as community service.
As regards the facts imputed to Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu, the prosecutors specified that he, as an adviser to the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "had falsely drawn up several minutes of acceptance, rather than selling the contracts of services previously keyed by the O.C.P.I., which had Ia<0xC8><0x99>i with the administrators of the companies S.C. Gaus SRL".
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, and other former or current employees of the OCPI were sent to trial in this case, the accusations being the settlement of some services to the aforementioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
Before the trial it exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
According to FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can only host a major handball competition in 2024, and preparing the women’s handball national team for the Olympics qualifier costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for the Romanian women's handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for this it has to pass two stages of caudine forks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masseurs, goalkeeper coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to obtain the qualification of some things, specifically materials for physical training, of which we have never heard.
All this to get to the Olympics. And I'll do everything that's up to me to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because right now we are in the Stone Age with preparation.
“The teams we fight with have these materials and have had them for some time,” Dedu said, noting that he is trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
President FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to call into question a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let’s not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic districts were built entirely within two years.
Before 1992, the current Olympic area of Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same was true in London, where the hosting of the 2012 Olympics was also a success in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Ga<0xC5><0xA3>u went civilized with a project, people gave their agreement in principle, but they quickly became clear that the hall would never be built.
And I had talks with the EHF, I told them that we want to, that we are able to organize and they said that they agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discuss concretely.
"So we have all the opening, and the EHF and the IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked all the coaches to be reserved in the predictions, that if they do not fulfill they will turn against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players debut on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said at a press conference on Tuesday that all the Romanian team members are ready for the matches of the World Cup in England, where they hope to obtain two victories: "We are ready".
Both I and my colleagues have the engines at full speed.
We practiced to give the best return in the four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let’s take it easy, first with France and then we’ll see.
“If we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the culmination of so many years of work.
I would like to not disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with good results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romanian national team coach Lynn Howells, who is in his first World Cup coaching experience, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I am sure that the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it is very important that in every match I make the Romanians proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitra<0xC8><0x99>, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These guys started playing in Romania's teams at the age of 18-19, so there is cohesion, there is a gang of friends, who set out to realize a dream," Dumitras said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will play in Group D, with the following matches scheduled: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.

14 million lei donated to "St. Spiridon" Hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i at the rectification of the budget
What will be purchased with this significant amount of money?
The St. Spiridon Hospital received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget correction, approximately 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and development of some clinics, but also in equipment and medical technology for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new CT computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgical interventions, six beds of ATI properly equipped, ophthalmological microscope and other devices necessary to carry out the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and layout of the "Great Burning".
From the money from the budget rectification, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, in the coming days we will be receiving work from the bridge connecting the UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transport of the patient from the UPU to the neighboring clinics," the manager of the medical unit explained.
The hospital will soon also have the Dermatology Clinic in T<0xC4><0x83>t<0xC4><0x83>ra<0xC8><0x99>i, which it will organize in an outpatient setting, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where the outpatient allergy, hematology and endocrinology are located and will have about 30 beds.
Ia<0xC8><0x99>ul, laughed at by RATP controllers and a leaflet.
A Tourist's Patience
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither I nor my wife want to tread on your city again.
Inadvertently, they were struck by the erroneous information in the leaflets, by the insensitivity of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, by a fine "as the law says".
The husbands arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Center and asked for tourist brochures.
They also received a leaflet in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the spouses visited Ia<0xC5><0x9F>.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Since there were no tickets in the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the leaflet: that they can take the ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the leaflet, they got on a bus and tried to send SMS according to the instructions on the leaflet.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said that there was no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
WHERE DO I KNOW what was written in the local press, coming the night before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation to them, they said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all they can do is give us a single fine instead of 2 (my wife and I).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day visiting the gendarmerie and giving statements there!", says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of the erroneous information on the leaflet and the controllers who “applied the law to blood.”
It’s not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not overreacting, but the point is, I felt cheated.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and were placed in pre-trial detention.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui moved, yesterday, to the Court of Appeal Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
The magistrates from Iasi judged the first trial in a non-public hearing in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the actual start of the court hearing, one of the Iasi judges to whom the case had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.
The magistrate was active until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the president of the Pe nale Section, being the one who, on April 9, admitted a challenge made by four of the defendants, ordering their placement in house arrest.
Currently, the case is being judged by a panel that includes the magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier in the case, Judge Dan An Ton also abstained on the grounds that his daughter was in a cohabitation relationship with one of the rape lawyers.
The two judges decided that the rapists from Vaslui should remain in pre-trial detention.
The Blacks will be incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when the judges will reconsider the possibility of their release.
The next trial period will take place at the Court of Appeal Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on October 6.
Before reaching the Iasi Court of Appeal, the van with which the rapists from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident in the P<0xC4><0x83>curari district, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
The Iveco van with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volkswagen car that had left the Canta street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van was driving from the end of P<0xC4><0x83>curari.
The car entered Ia<0xC8><0x99>i here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i through Stalls, then on the belt road.
They shortened the road by a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the detainees' escort called another transport to pick up the detainees.
Soon, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the Maximum Security Penitentiary in Iasi, which took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
In the aftermath of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the detainees came out at speed, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of the vehicles have amicably agreed on the damages to be paid," said chief commissioner M<0xC4><0x83>d<0xC4><0x83>lin <0xC8><0x9A><0xC4><0x83>ranu, from the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what lies ahead.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and bluntly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize represent, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the Romanian state’s ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Surely, if those migrants will really accept to settle in our localities, the chances of integrating them quickly into Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am sure they will be the first to lose patience.
Parasitized by underworld and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color were unable to absorb European funds, make modern roads, kindergartens or schools, provide decent health care, collect dirt from the streets, create honorably paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what produces much wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
We are first hitting on the warlike hypocrisy of the strong EU states, which show the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
I’m afraid someone will steal their national identity.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, while invoking only the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, accept no other destination for the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Not all refugees are Syrian, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be mocked.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, relying strictly on the book of political correctness, they demand peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even from time to time some foreign capital enters the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosed construction, divided and outdated by the situation.
I deplored the fact that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but neither does the EU have a future plan.
Improvisations and threats don’t help.
Then what good is the EU, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be questioned because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders as if through cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what lies ahead.
7,000 euros per year to rent Club Pogor.
Practically imposed destination
The tender for the concession shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the courtyard of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concession for a duration of 10 years.
The construction has a useful area of 134 sqm, on two levels of hrub.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of literary cafe, bookstore or other activities with a cultural profile.
The building was valued at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,300, the starting price of the tender being <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,830 per year, with a bidding step of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and permanently operate the building and fully cover the costs of rehabilitation of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.

The club's concession offers are expected until September 18.
Two brothers from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-old children, respectively 11-year-old brothers from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were taken urgently to the hospital "Santa Maria" in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
They are in stable condition, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20 he received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the darkness of the 90s, when she was only two months old, little, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman who came out, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met him again.
Crina will be 20 years old, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought of giving their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, in Iasi, to know her unclear past.
The "Iasi Newspaper", which witnessed the efforts to search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
The reports of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the town of Iasi Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital, in the city.
At home there began to be disagreements between the parents, and the mother was forced to leave the home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
He stopped the girl, and since then I haven't known anything.
“When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late,” recalls Alina, the girl’s biological mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pascani, and also then the father of the girl, Costic<0xC4><0x83> Balkan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives would be permanently separated.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After the hospitalization, Crina’s father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
“She thought she was abandoned,” says a granddaughter of the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, which then gave her to the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but could not.
They fell instantly in love with the blonde Crina, and after some time she was going to move permanently with them to Italy.
The girl had already completed almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our daughter.
“As if my wife had given him life,” Salvadore, the adoptive father, tells us smiling as he grabs the girl’s weak hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina’s parents, Alina and Costic<0xC4><0x83>, continued the searches separately, each where he could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but did not receive any answer where his child might be.
The police then told her that she may have died, but in Iasi the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the Tribunal that she was going to Italy, to Palermo.
And conditions to look for it I never had.
We prayed to God that he would be well.
I thought about it in all the years that passed, but there was no possibility to walk, to find it.
“It’s hard,” Crina’s biological mother tells us with tears in her eyes.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past ties her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
“I wanted to meet my parents in Romania,” says Crina delighted.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling in Iasi, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore’s desire to find the biological family of Crina.
The search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We only got one name, Balkan Costic<0xC4><0x83>, then the locality, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I was able to ask if the name received exists by locality.
Then they gave me some indications, except that the person they found was not the one they were looking for.
“It took us about a month to find the girl’s biological father,” Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim explains.
In total, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costic<0xC4><0x83> and Alina, especially since each had his domicile in another locality.
We started somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of the biological parents and the discussions.
"Then we decided to have a first meeting in September," Romica Ichim added.
This past weekend, Alina and Costic<0xC4><0x83> saw their lost daughter for the first time in the hospital halls of Iasi, 20 years ago.
The father, moved, could hardly contain his tears, and his hands trembled unceasingly.
He barely exchanged a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't sleep much.
He was excited, trembling.
"To see your child after all these years, it's something," says a niece, who also came with Costica from Ruginosa.
The meeting of Crina with her biological mother and brother
In talks with his daughter, who is about to study at a well-rated university in Italy, Costic<0xC4><0x83> Balkan told him, among other things, that if he wanted to return to him, in the village, he could come quietly: he could give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and join a household.
My mother is also excited, she cries, and she hardly thinks this can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I never thought this could happen.
I’ve seen such cases on TV, I’ve been thinking these years, I’ve been hoping, but I didn’t think I could be like that.
They are very big emotions.
If only he could forgive me.
I hope to visit you in the future.
"I hope we can keep a tie," cries Crina's mother Alina, as she holds a napkin in her hand.
In him she still hides her tears of happiness, because soon she will see her face after so much bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will turn 20 in just a few days this month, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she has a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
My parents are the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina tells us.
First family reunion in Iasi
In Pia<0xC8><0x9B>a Unirii, under the sky of the beginning of autumn, the Ruginosa family once again unites their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishes high school, according to the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
No longer do they separate borders or countries, but only one barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian owner of a local in the center of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, they passed easily.
Those who managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind made, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do so again.
It’s the first event of its kind, with such an emotional load, and I’m glad it’s a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who use drugs, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we are trying to bring back something good to society.
"If I am asked again for such an event, I will do it with great delight," says Romica Ichim, the director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counseling Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, smiling.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, walk away telling stories.
They have a lot to say to each other.
Arms at arm's length at the PSD yesterday.
Everyone draws their soul
The camps of the PSD branch in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i have concluded a ceasefire with a gun to the foot.
After successive rounds of talks from Friday to Sunday, the first of which was also the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party’s executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the social democrats will send him a whole list of potential candidates for the party’s posts.
Far from over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a break to allow the fighters to draw their souls.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who wish to do so.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussion over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain had been established.
In the October elections, fierce competition is expected for the position of president of the PSD’s county branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office of the party’s branch in Iasi are State Secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Laz<0xC4><0x83>r, County Councillor Vasile Catea and Acting President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
To these could be added the mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant considered is also the candidacy of the leader of the PSD county councilors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer register in the race, sources within the party saying that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former head of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day, candidacies can be submitted, and it would not surprise anyone if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain even after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all the new leadership structures," Catea said.
Until internal elections are held, the leadership of the PSD’s county branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29, with the preparation of the elections practically to be ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, county councilor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with camp Nichita.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu has appreciated the talks of the last days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions related to the candidacy for the PSD Ia<0xC8><0x99>i presidency, the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
A judge from Ia<0xC8><0x99>i rejected the file of the rapists from Vaslui on the grounds of concubinage
The seven young men from Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal.
Vasluyans sentenced to sentences between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will today present their arguments on their release, after the substantive court, the Judicatura Vaslui, established their incarceration immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The case was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with the magistrate Dan Anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton alleged that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the co-concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luke defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this case.
How Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate of the Judiciary of Vaslui who sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
The judge speaks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
"The court finds that after the placement under the preventive measure of judicial control, a measure restrictive of liberty but not deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, there was a strong sense of indignation at the level of the local and national community about the fact that persons accused of serious acts are being judged to a less restrictive degree," Jud said.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be a “church door”.
"The court underlines that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants wanted to highlight through the defenses they made, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the Future of Europe
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in recent decades cannot continue the same in the years to come.
By Saturday, probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in the UK, many wonder how much it can affect our choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is Labour’s most radical leftist leader since the war.
An outspoken Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to take the royal family out of Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a nuclear sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today" and the EU's "Hamas Today" and "Hisbolism" movements).
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferred to the United States.
On the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what Tsipras was saying and promising in Greece until he faced the real world and economic legislatures.
The economic program of the new Labour leader foresees, among other things, massive renationalizations and the printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Sure, some may wonder why the solution with the printing of money is not unanimously adopted in the world, we would then have a general global prosperity!, but who can prevent such details.
Sure, we can tax the bankers, who have become a kind of service enemy of the left, with blood, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Hollande.
The extra sums are quickly swallowed up by the generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher said, “The problem with socialism is that at some point the money of others runs out.”
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his beliefs as the new party leader, failed miserably in the election.
And then there was still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were significantly more influential than they are now.
Given the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant across the workforce, and extensive automations have made the industry massively in need of highly skilled workers, Corbyn’s rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even in opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn’s choice increases the chances of Brexit, or Britain’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of the globalization that imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and you look at the refugee crisis that shakes the foundations of the EU, you come up with an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which should take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the whole European project and the deep breaches created within it by the Euro crisis and now by the refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
All the more so since for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which however Berlin becomes more and more the dominant actor).
True, the British business community, the City, are strong advocates of the country’s remaining in the EU.
But today’s Europe is no longer the one of the past.
There are many resentments, which are increasing in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we even recently had a sample in the speech of Jean Clude Junker, tends increasingly to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this is happening as electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic parties across the continent grows dramatically.
In other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever before.
That’s why the Financial Times draws its conclusion when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we are witnessing a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the states in the region and the periphery of interest and decision-making in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds his populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in recent decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both caused by hasty decisions that only took into account the integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect Romania’s situation greatly.
And it’s hard to rule out anything from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
But behind its fame lies something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories, recipes for success in life, are delivered to us.
That something also has a name.
It's called "struggle."
What to write about Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i?
What else is there to say, actually?
His face appeared on the banknotes.
And recently, a well-known Romanian bank hired an actor to play him in an advertising clip.
Brancusi produces and delivers money almost 60 years since it is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with his offspring, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i".
The country is dotted with its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
The infiltration capacity of Brancusi is huge.
Even the Communists failed to remove it from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes now spread over the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what would there be to say, to write about this man?
Looking at the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you weren’t lucky enough to be born into a big city and into a wealthy family, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life is the perfect counter-example.
And maybe here would be a key.
This is where the next text should begin.
With a sentence, no matter how detestable they are.
Here are the stupid success stories that are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look closely at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he succeeded in life, how, today, of him heard a whole world?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobi<0xC8><0x9B>a, a small village in Pe<0xC8><0x99>ti<0xC8><0x99>ani commune, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i led a modest life, but one of which would collect his landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre <0xC8><0x9A>u<0xC8><0x9B>ea, in Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people were happily living a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to the next.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
However, Brancusi’s childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor the years spent in the native locality.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i was three years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the turkey was made "in the boiler", watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going well, Brancusi catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with turquoise and drinks.
He falls into sleep almost instantly.
The first people notice it only after a few minutes.
My mother panicked, then went into hysteria, thinking her son was dead.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by his beatitudes, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who await him with their souls to their mouths.
The party immediately turns into mourning.
Father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brându<0xC5><0x9F>a, the dolphora and servant of the Brâncu<0xC5><0x9F>i.
Brând<0xC5><0x9F>a checks the child’s breathing, then puts horse dung, gathered from around, under his nose.
The child sneezes heavily.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep on his drunkenness of joy, the party with booing continues with even more force.
The next day, father and son meet in the orchard.
Radu Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i asks Constantine to collect some sticks and bring them to him.
The father puts his child upside down and, with the boy’s cheeks, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the sting of the blows, the little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can be seen from a different perspective and that the things around can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in his old age, whether the star itself participated in his disturbance.
Would the sun have been as disturbed as his father by what had happened to him?
At present, the city is not working.
A parliamentarian appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for him.
Independent deputy Viorel Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> called on the PSD and PNL to stop the internal struggles and to reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great division and that’s all.
I haven’t seen anything from the USL projects of 2012 that will continue.
Neither highway nor Regional Emergency Hospital, just see how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let’s put politics aside, get together and talk.
At the moment, the city is not working.
“If you’re busy with internal warfare, you don’t have time for those who chose you,” Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> said.
He considered that the current political class has disappointed the electorate in Iasi, the consequence of which will be a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the loyal electorate of the parties.
Also, the deputy believes that the voters will also orient themselves towards the traditional parties, expressing their reservation towards new political initiatives, such as the party "For Iasi" that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break from the right-wing electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually right-wing.
"The right is crumbling even more, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD," Bl<0xC4><0x83>jut said.
He said he was not interested in a candidacy in the upcoming local elections, denying rumors about his intention to run for mayor.
I said I don’t want to run for any office.
I am still wondering if I will continue as a member in the next term.
I tried to call for unity for Iasi and in the talks in the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make my own image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
