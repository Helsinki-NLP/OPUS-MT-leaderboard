Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws beginning in 2009 that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and remove citizens with a judicial record from voting rights.
Prior to the 2006 election, no state in the United States required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a state government agency.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
There's more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their ID card with photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs that vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have enacted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the pre-voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of early voters were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, who made up 76% of voters, accounted for only 46% of early voters.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General stepped in to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undeniably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that were passed and see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that passed these laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Pass the Test or Not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This is why men who are already reluctant to take screening tests are even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, found a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that you are 30 to 40% more likely to have metastases if you are not screened.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at higher risk.
The key is to make the right decision once you've detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not impair long-term life, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer treatment.
Increasingly, criteria are being precisely determined for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you pass the test anyway.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from them.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is very damaging to people’s health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular, lifelong physical activity protects against colon cancer.”
Dietary
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of getting colorectal cancer.
But so are the meats, and they should be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"These can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
Mr. Beaulieu also stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
The Higgs boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is indeed the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are holding a genuine new particle, and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but data is still lacking to be perfectly certain.
Suppose it's Higgs anyway, since the chances of getting it wrong seem slim, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this world, a fatally inescapable law that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And on the other side are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the Higgs boson would be in some way related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all animals as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this column, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" is born an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, that needs to be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach very, very high energies, a bit like if it were a frozen pond of which only a very large rock could wrinkle the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
Not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while others (like the photon, here) do not.
Now, what "can bring" all this research, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the MS.
There are also many who ardently wish that we find them, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (ops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-ops!).
But no such discrepancies have been found at CERN so far.
Consequences
The repercussions of this research in the daily life of Monsieur et Madame Tout-le-Monde are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
In the early 1960s, the laser pioneers at Bell Laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work was about to trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed), in 1962 - once told us - at first the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although not at all its original intention, now serves as an "eye" to all the digital cameras in the world, and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... <0x7C> The Duty
With its Dying with Dignity Commission, Quebec has recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate is expected to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this essential area.
Duty has tried to look at it more closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him up had left him with a two-year respite.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven," he said, half-fig half-grape, lying in his bed at the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois, of Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease does its job: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even from eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself help eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man, it pisses standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Returning to the child’s stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept the regression, he notes.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is of dying “consciously and suffocated.”
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good kids,” she added.
“I don’t have any wishes in life anymore,” she said, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting, in the next few days, for a final visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance are provided.
These are palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed per 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When dying, we will agree to provide oral care to brandy or Pepsi, depending on the request.
Diabetics will no longer have to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, Mr. X, who died overnight, was served a beer.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but are not the same.
Alongside a 93-year-old man savoring his last family gathering in the yard, stuck in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old boy tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
The Problem of Access to Palliative Care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his or her life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Palliative Home Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that causes several doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care leaders including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without being relieved.
I fear that patients will only ask to die because they are not receiving adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are hard on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Helene Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was stopping fighting, she said.
Yet she told me I was finished!
No Almighty Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not complying with their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Société de soins palliatifs à domicile du Grand Montréal, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which means that the patient falls asleep until the moment of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about a formidable "system", mixing construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been crumbling since we took the big money," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal erupted in 2011, through a substantive investigation into malpractice related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only consented backwards.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the transport ministry alone would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts", some restraining their instincts to get a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already knocked down two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will manage to "demonstrate the ploys behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also works with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the police officers of the "Hammer Squad" who, since 2009, would have led the "cartel of sewers" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and charges of fraud and corruption against city officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of embezzling repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
In addition, engineers on the streets of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accuro and Lino Zambito, are formally accused.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years, he paid 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who paid the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed winds in the 2000s, giving more than C$88,000 (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to provincial parties, especially the then-Liberals.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraiser for the former liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts that inflated the costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was working smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials confessed to having their legs grease by inflating the bills by 30% to 40%, with fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first women elected in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the middle of a real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says that she "pulls a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the culprits."
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
The wound is being cleaned up, but it would take a Montreal-specific investigation unit and a day watch to prevent the dubious practices from returning.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected with knowledge of the ploy", when they did not dip in the magic!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that won’t change the game, according to him: “As long as we don’t strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He advocates a complete revision of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We can not go any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I grow by their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
In the game, it’s easier.
Everything goes very quickly in football.
But I'm not on fire.
From my beginnings at the Clairefontaine INF pre-training center to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Sure, I'm fine.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equals in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with upscale clubs.
He has been around great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting conversation with him.
I came out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What are your thoughts on the first half of the season at PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th round with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say against very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to receive in the return 8th final.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project come to fruition.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we are really looking forward to winning this title.
Last season, we didn’t go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it’s the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It is normal that we expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have.
We accept it completely.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame us, it is sure to be a bit frustrating.
One wonders what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer present.
Look at Manchester City who haven’t been able to qualify for the finals in two seasons, they’ve also made huge expenses!
With regard to the sums invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
It shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's good to say there's a Zlatan addiction.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very good and he has a lot of goals.
He came for that and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
He proved everywhere he went that he was a great player, a global star.
Within the group, there is respect for the man and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbing game time.
I saw things there and came out stronger.
Today, I manage to make good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine and today we must behave in an exemplary manner.
What are your thoughts on Didier Deschamps’ first months at the helm of the Bleus?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the winner.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don’t want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Bleus to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) torn off on October 16 in Spain a founding match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks
This is the opposite of current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files peer to peer.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (the prices are recorded on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competitive with the dollar or the euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that you earn by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this type of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and processes trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both bookkeepers, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the manner of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and whose winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this extra line.
This is a file hash phase, that is, transforming a large file into a shorter, more unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to cheat, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is split by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves some room for improvement.
The difficulty of the challenge is also met with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
“The flaw used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB is also reporting on the potential for money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Cinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come back cheaper.
The wearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who says he has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in case of success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We punished mainly Afghan farmers as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban raids on Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and blood due to struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had then been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved nowadays.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The leading figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen, seizing government land and selling it to returnees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US subcontracting contracts.
Most of them did not fight, and most of them did not fight.
People, as I heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have been around the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of some leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already preoccupied with reconstituting provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and much earlier.
No industry has been rebuilt, no dams have been repaired, and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
There has been a widespread rumor that Afghanistan possesses immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on-site, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the My Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
It will also take Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to re-establish normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school for girls and boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of "civilo-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, has carried out, and has carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of villages.
This work, greedy of local labor, could help to contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, protection of soils and increase of cultivable areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small farming achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small amount of civil aid in their favour, well controlled and directly affecting them.
A constitution with forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker move from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its part.
Taking everyone on board, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave this Assembly two more months to complete its work.
For almost two years Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, several times amended, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "betray his word" and "treat the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as protest rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he claimed in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this use of a hasty vote is an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers", these supposedly to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, believing they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added in haste, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, most of the articles were voted on unanimously.
Commentators were amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, has 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, article 2 ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," respond the Liberals, who see it only as a blow to communication.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see in it the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are further fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on Egypt's constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary.
This refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question may arise in the future as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as demanded by human rights associations.
They also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, there are no more articles echoing the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, protests are scheduled this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will parade on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Center of the World and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comfort, and wilderness.
Argumenty i Fakty has selected five main reasons to visit Israel.
Go and love the holy places
A must-see: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these “baptismal funds” will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers walk the Rue de la Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the praetorium), where the trial was held, and then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and of the burial.
Here is the Christian centre of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where grew the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place of the Jews: the Wailing Wall which constitutes the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Masada Fortress, an ancient refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there on their own.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
The old beliefs are that pagan gods once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First of all: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It mainly exhibits the paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of moulds of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures by Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and enter into total darkness.
Stars are shining.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel’s three major seaside resorts lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not drop below 21° while that of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure-colored water contains brine and very easily retains swimmers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
We come to perform a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat different diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to stroll through the narrow alleys that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet newlyweds who came to take photoshoots from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "conquer" the Crusader fortress.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, notably Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable into shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As far as urban transport is concerned, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on the Sabbath.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturdays, markets, shops and public transport cease to operate.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scaleless fish, and dishes consisting of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish dough, different sauces, ground chickpea balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, we find many well-fed cats who walk around in the haughty air.
We can see them at night sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
These cats love passing places and do not refuse to be fed.
Renting a car varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Admission to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Who has language, to Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
As deputies and human rights activists argue over what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
As of December 1, a law has come into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate his/her language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew his/her work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or educational diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Profit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, People's Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it mean?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, respond the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "journey" to an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his peers will torment themselves for months without food and without paper and will have to work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are cheated, their passports are taken, and they do not receive the salary," said Tolib Charipov, head of the Migration Services Directorate for Labour of Tajikistan's Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, policeman!
However, many nationals of Central Asian republics who wish to come to make money in Russia say that they not only do not know the language of the country where they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to attend even a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children, not to mention dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to make money as soon as the opportunity presents itself.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will only be for migrants who have legal status.
Without statute, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defend to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and still these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then you can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have fake documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They are asking us for 100, 200 rubles, something to buy cigarettes, tea," Umed Khushkadamov, a Tajik national, told reporters.
“Hurry up, don’t skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language exam certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not get them for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Officials and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “paper scraps”.
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to pass the first-time exam time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against the bearers of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it was the shooting at weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow jurist Dmitry Vinogradov, which left seven dead.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun licence from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee for security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced in the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that strengthening civil arms laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: From the factory to the officer
The arms black market is supplied through several channels.
There are five main channels, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking weapons orders
The first is "the military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of black market weapons are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stockpiles and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of them have often suffered explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately set in order to conceal the deficit," the former soldier said.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are for something.
“We see private weapons factories that do not compete with the competition in the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,” says an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market ended up there “because of employees whose work is linked to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from “illegal excavations”.
A salesman and consultant at an armory who asked to remain anonymous said that no one has bought the weapons found by these underground excavators for a long time; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will pick up the new goods from military warehouses.
The person buys a unit, for example a TT gun, through a sign.
We deliver it to him by passing the merchandise through a wire mesh.
"He transports it to the city and resells it for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900 per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers," the seller added.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and asked me to come to the Begovaya station where someone was going to take me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I have to know someone who has a contact, the salesman explains. I know someone, but I don't trust them.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you also have to come by saying for example "On behalf of such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them to him.
The new little ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former militaryman Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want".
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," recalls the soldier.
There is no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try anything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller to the forest and install a target.
“I’m allowed to fire and when I’m convinced that the weapon is working well, we start negotiating,” he said.
A shop from the sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"It is enough to have a precise sum of money," the ad reads on the site "Buy a pistol or a combat machine gun."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to miners?

I have heard about this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take the lead.

Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.

It was taken out of long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes decreased in Russia by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
U.S.: Fast Food and Supermarket Employees Strike
Nearly a quarter of American teens go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or fade rapidly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Alongside the modest rise in wages for workers at Walmart and in fast-food chains, the organizers of the protests want unions to be created.
This sector is not yet covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the “Black Friday,” as a shower of sales taking over millions of people swept across America and sometimes sparked splashes.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their posts to organize pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart markets everything from diapers to shotguns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid employees at Walmart do their shopping only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap especially because of the low salaries of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded a salary increase, they complained about the fact that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the base employee at Walmart who earns $9.5 an hour, this is an amount he cannot afford.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have shown that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart shifted the entire wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, every ride in the store would cost them 46 cents more.
They will spend in a year only $12.39 more than now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
"Black Friday" continued in stores from 8 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over that period 5,000 items per second.
Its caisses have made a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the Huffington Post that at least "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was just "an operation of com' among many others" by the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet established there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s announces selling billions of portions and then they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods increase them over time, but by little, on average, its basic employees earn in New York $8.90 an hour.
No one touches them less than they do in this city.
I can't imagine living with that money in New York.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald’s after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you are going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They also called for unions to be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters with harassment or dismissal.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, seizing fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near Times Square’s McDonald’s with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: “McDonald’s announces selling billions of portions and then they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you’ve done honestly!”
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said, “We all need to support fast food workers so that they get the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times described the event as the largest event in the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
At the moment it is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
“At the moment, we only manage to deceive the brain on average.”
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the group of interactive 3D technologies of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment at the pixels on flat screen and sometimes at the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess at the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in controlling by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although the Kinect has rendered the physical interaction, a lot of things take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information capture has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, not really.
We're trying to change that and we're working on real 3D imaging systems that run on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We must bring out the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overrated?
This cannot be called the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of one's actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its niche.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought about gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, in what way would you ask me to pass you that can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or cannot do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
This can be for example laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to the latter point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche of our Redmond lab gave the sensors a regular processing delay between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more frames per second.
Shouldn’t the number of cameras be increased?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual visible field sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
"As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical but here is what I think: the best option would be a "transient" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to move from glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes their strength (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea point to: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands don’t feel anything.
What answers is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image support.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are actually meant to attribute palpability to these "airborne images": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work presenting perspectives.
- And you tried to cheat the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he should normally feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is still one task underneath that will have to be done for a long time: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that they are walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we only manage to deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to city dwellers who are ahead of the curve, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed eminent actors of the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city border and who have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that you can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the parties and trendy vernissages.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always bring together the crowds, regardless of their place of exhibition.
He was one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Petersbourg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller was a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands a Barbary organ and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role because of his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a seamstress specialized in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image maker and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I knew this was my way.
Then the wave of the old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free ones of my kind were misunderstood.
I began to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theater, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important to me to be at the center of St. Petersburg's culture, where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took a seat in Pushkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemian Petersburg.
Many were born there: The NAMES, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour coming with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in playback in tight jerseys, they included Igor Vdovin, composer now in fashion.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg animated a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education was received from us.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as regulars.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the award "The personalities of our city".
I was named Painter of the Year, and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong topicality and acuity.
I’m going to have an exhibition scheduled “The Russian Museum through the Clowns”.
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares me to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the dress that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit in his face instead.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
- Recently we saw you playing the organ player of Barbary. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be neat, delicate, liqueurous.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, the bohemian supporters liked one thing, the fools another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less management, money, everything perishes.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
They say: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are discarded, because it takes higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make a way for them.
Currently, it is the "realm of taste" that is blooming.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must be found in other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Childbirth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with Earthlings on board set off in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to keep our species alive in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"It's about Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then we put into orbit insects, small reproductive drosophilous flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how a weightless embryo developed.
We get at the exit a quite normal chick.
It is then that the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick has to find support, it has to get on its legs and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
When they found no support, the chicks shook in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We opened their eyes twice, and then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only embark on species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. We have to do this kind of research," remarks Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to make reproductions directly in space.
It's not a small business.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans are capable of this in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold up after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the theft.
“Nobody was answering that question,” said Vakhtang Vachnadze, a retired rocket and space executive.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicle exits.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but nevertheless a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Since the baby is about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of the mother's belly, it is easier to get used to the water afterwards.
This is in principle logical, because from birth until his first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the newborn child weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, the pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's thrust capacity is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on the birth simulators.
Of course, you can prepare a childbirth in a special room, the woman will manage to get it out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the terrestrial attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
One cannot dress an infant as an adult with a special suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely inadapted," predicts the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their spaceborn offspring.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institution of Public Finance Control) said: "The control of pseudo-self-employment (Czech: <0xC5><0xA0>varc system) has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its implementation.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Institution of Public Finance Control, said in an interview with Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its enforcement must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking here,” Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
A joint review by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar findings.
He cites Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as's approach to the "<0xC5><0xA0>varc system" as an example of abusive practice.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDG is not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect to demand compliance with the law," Kala said.
During the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was it really about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how public procurement and specific national legislation and practice are managed.
We have put all this together and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, some very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "severer and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to continuously develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it mean for you?
Such a common control should just help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when it does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering market thresholds, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It could be that this system is so overwhelmed with paperwork, that those looking for the loopholes will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems with regard to the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
As for the institutions, like the ISC, the similarly organized Bundesrechnungshof operates there, it also has a somewhat differently constituted council, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way .
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, but with a nuance in relation to our system: as Germany is a federal structure, it also has accounts of this type at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed in our country by the regions and municipalities are there controlled at the level of the Länder's accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model but surely it cannot be said to do better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, probably not, but I repeat, I do not have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we see as a model, also faces a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As regards national legislation, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean to you as an institution, are its effects already being felt?
As this amendment has come into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out ex post checks, we have to count on some delay.
Our remarks relate only to the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for the "detection of risks of mismanagement" with which we have screened almost 14 000 public procurement contracts - there, of course, these changes will be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be more of an advantage or an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm that.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the market law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
What is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDG is not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system - what does that mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system banned or allowed?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He can declare, “We’re going to change the law and authorize it,” but he can’t say that we’re going to act as if nothing happened.
The Contracts Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be completed, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking here.
The roads are in frozen places, but most remain passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy as well.
The network, however, remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were open this morning, but in places that were frozen and also snowy.
Temperatures have dropped and oscillate between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the peaks of the Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service indicates that, due to fog, visibility was sometimes reduced.
The R6 expressway and national roads in the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance remains to be exercised, for example on some bridges whose covering can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third category tracks, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There are still remains on some of their sections of snow remains frozen and sometimes crowded by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Highways and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by ice formation and that traffic jammed snow can be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region located at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Routes I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by traffic is present on the roads in the areas located at altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather today will be dry, mostly clear, with partly cloudy periods.
It will be windy and the temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen area are now practicable, although, in some places, it is necessary to be more vigilant and to adapt its driving to the weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to pass through fog areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is practically easy to use, but road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in South Pilsen district and Tachov district.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on less-traveled roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region must now count on a thick, soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>, after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field overnight; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
In other parts of the region, most roads are easily accessible.
"On the heights of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district there are remains of snow.
Drivers driving towards Jeseník should expect to encounter at the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass a thick and soft layer of snow, the head of the road maintenance services of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also visited during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc roads are easily accessible, but in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk drivers should be careful in sections of forested areas with wet roads.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, Northern Bohemian road maintenance services reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially southeast of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic problems have been reported for the time being.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, especially around <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear skies and frost at night.
Difficult conditions on National Highway 13 at the border between the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec regions are also reported from the main roads.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that bent under the weight of the snow until they reached the road.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said: “In concert, we want to collect positive energy.”
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh about it and we think that we are the only group capable of collecting a remnant of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you are setting up a very unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We have decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end practically by the time the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap along with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "End of the world cancelled" (Czech "Konec sv<0xC4><0x9B>ta zru<0xC5><0xA1>eno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it during these charitable concerts?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also meet at some point in a very unique live show on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and have fun.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training center, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on for the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, with the association Tap, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Institute and offer them activities that interest them and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers take to the stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> will be on stage.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other “mega events” of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the home of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it sounds at first glance.
We have five members in electric wheelchairs whose machines must travel in the hold, of course we also pack a lot of luggage and instrument boxes.
So far everything has more or less always gone well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned from, everything went smoothly.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, public attitude towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to prioritize a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is being set up to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
How do we catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are on the contrary at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, let’s go back a few years, what motivated you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people ready to get involved in something.
And as I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
The success has only happened in the last few years, if I’m not mistaken?
True, connecting with well-known singers and working actively to promote the band helped us.
We have understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to EU grants, we can, in addition, afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
Show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Few are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, whom we must take pity on.
They are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, it is not only a breakthrough for them but for society as a whole.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think that's quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
One of them, Laya Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come and go, there's nothing we can do about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world cancelled" will be sung jointly.
The aim of the concert is to raise financial resources (to the tune of CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional Studeo training centre in Prague at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, entry is free for children up to 12 years, pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started working closely with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of ESA projects.
The journey from Poland to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the lecture of A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on December 6, 1933, in which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the auditors cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch awards in France for his book Introduction to Astronautics.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of world-renowned astronautics, his contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
In 1925 a draisine was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket would be used to propel or brake the draisin.
The only known information about this draisine is from the press of the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is clear from the preserved documents that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, drawn by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work devoted to aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is talk of a company in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problème, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and as early as the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
An upgraded version, the RM-1A, was later built, and during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was halted.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first rockets of type RM.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B it was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C it was 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aeronautics Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Thereafter, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland joined COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and a national COSPAR committee was established two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public works.
This decision has raised a lively debate in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and the free (unlimited) movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (wages) generate a tension on prices.
This is to be understood as meaning that a producer endeavours, by importing goods sold cheaply, to withstand economic competition by "making the price of the competitor more expensive" in order to take away a larger share of the market and thereby increase his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy cheaply, or disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it engenders, the social charges of the State necessarily increase.
All this situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that there is no need to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without regard for social collapse.
This is mainly manifested in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the diktat of private capital prices, especially in the field of wages.
This is achieved, on the one hand, by a system of economic constraints in case of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
The result is growing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In the FRG, for years there have been public distribution points of food for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay an extra to ensure that they reach the minimum living wage.
Such a scandal has for example been brought to light in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of practically all the southern EU Member States generate, without a doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or to live with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that their capital will be invested in the day.
The question must be asked here: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or else a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are tired of saying that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the led economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, and even direct today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and thereby the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby in every state.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual advantages, in the legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the FRG, the situation is such that due to a lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of legislation to law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as the Western-type constitutions state, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The state had long been in full decay and functions were assigned by violence.
Bribes, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The absolute underpants and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold"...... "Honest people did not seek to obtain any functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls".... 'It was really started to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was a 'spirit', which was transformed into an 'autocracy' and that it was necessary to choose a man"
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is a decadence without precedent of elites, without any effort to carry out profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and internally in Europe, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways of decreasing the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution lies in socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase citizens' influence over the government, and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will," Sting says in the song Fragile, whose main line is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be wars,” said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some side with Israel, arguing its right to self-defense and putting the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurring killings; after all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the Autonomous Territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a "behind the curtain" view, on which they mainly benefit from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (since the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small slice of Middle Eastern countries.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely of the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of a struggle for power.
In each epoch we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owed their acts to the throne to someone who directed their acts according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration of power has not been possible in a single generation.
Among the families possessing astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be considered as the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude him).
Little is written about them.
Of course I am.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world's first news agency (Reuters) in order to stop linking their name to serious criminal acts they were involved in, which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortunes or both.
They own major holdings in almost all the central banks of the world and prepare or conduct wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia placed the Russian government under control of the central bank).
Anyone who tried to stand up to this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America’s central bank status and began issuing his own money during the civil war (government, I understand) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the global level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated to the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population by 1 to 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the initiation of such a solution, the acquisition of such a final power, and the acquisition of such a solution).
The method used by the clan of the wealthiest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed to avoid the repetition of crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering World War I with the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany enormous war reparations, thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (they then had to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing the finger at the perpetrators, proposing simple solutions).
In the late 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (back to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or whether everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the sufferings of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of World War II, the founding of the State of Israel ignited a fire that could provoke a third world war.
If the international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (it is enough to see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong engenders another wrong according to an endless circle of violence and where one finds, at the origin of everything, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
Here we must differentiate between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because like us, international bankers offer people in elections only their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist world politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to that country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) expand to become a global conflict and, given that the world's oil flows through Iran, only one of the two countries that controls it will be destroyed.
In what light do the remarks made by David Rockefeller in 1994 now appear: “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
“Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to bear on their hand or forehead a mark of red iron, so that they may neither buy nor sell him who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that he who has common sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: when it all goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of protesters made up of Islamist students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a severe blow to the prestige of the United States, further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempted liberation of the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused in the United States a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed heavily to Jimmy Carter’s defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After some complicated adventures, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a rocambolesque cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make sightseeing for the shooting of a great sci-fi film.
Combination of genres
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a realistically conceived political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
Ambiences follow each other: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the epoch of events and the way in which, thanks to these photographs, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no major differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to arouse ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark cop "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not set in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran’s role is “held” by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity that also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many shares in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject offering in fact few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
It does very well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is dismissed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway are quite pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a greater place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with a moderate interest, appreciating the 70's directorship and retro style.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the trick.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts a public survey every year on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the contest of the settlement or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has recently considered adopting a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large European companies was at the root of our decision," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities mentioned is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women have been at an advantage in terms of life insurance rates because they objectively pose less risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
“The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the requirement to add biocomponents to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of hen cages, which has led to the price increase.
Criticism has also been expressed in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "spreading butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic is currently imposing its banks' demands by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of lobbyists are also at the root, for example, of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission has defended itself by arguing that it is only harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicate trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming that the existing directives result in food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that must include a warning on inflatable balloons stating that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to a US investigation that says balloons are, among toys, the leading cause of child death from suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
At home, too, we have strange ideas.
The following rule regarding European officials themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Laissez Faire" association of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com has named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation concerning the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and risked a hefty fine.
The organizers of this survey found the idea of paying money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidies interesting.
These ideas, however, did not come from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have the sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and as a result of so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had ended up with full stocks which it then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Subsidies for granting grants were proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), these were, in particular, to be used to draft grant applications granted by Brussels.
The EU says "weird regulations are rare".
While the regulations often raise criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning as well as in the area of its overall development deserve rather praise.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a fight that does not always win) stirs up strong emotions among the Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", for the name "Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum" that dates back to the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not on beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, today we find in the company of cheeses known worldwide as the Feta or the Gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or the Parma ham, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carp of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x99>eho<0xC5><0x88> ("Poebo<0xC5><0x88>")
Pardubice gingerbread ("Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> perník") and cakes called "Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice Cornets" ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ické trubi<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr. Speaker, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It is not being a senator or a president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can’t stand to see how the country has been looted for the last twenty years, that thieves are not under lock and key, and taxes and retirement ages are rising.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, then I try to bring a solution to make it change.
And since I am over forty years old and independent, a member of no party, I have no other way to influence the situation than to run in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set out for the Château (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who elected you?
I have always said that I will fight for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I were elected to the Senate, I would run for president.
My purpose is not the function, it is only an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we moan at the bar or in front of our TV set, but it is also that we trample on those who are trying to bring about change.
To this is added the press that breaks people's reputations and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said about me that I bribe journalists or that I was an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You have begun the struggle for the Castle with the themes of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK].
To this end, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I pushed for a profession as a tour guide, I won the case.
The problem is politicianship: when someone comes from the left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to win the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma partisans, to take from each side what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself a man of the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place me rather on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left-wing or right-wing, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDGs, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you’re a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimum goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of parliament, you have only slogans left.
You won’t survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct suffrage, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without a doubt, to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just gotten into politics and I'm trying to get the majority's support for my program.
I'm just trying to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to a number of personalities and asked them to also run in the Senate elections.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil frauds.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, gave their vote to an establishment representative.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose change.
In spite of everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I do not have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I do not have the financial means.
I also don’t have any money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand in my “transparent” account.
Don't you have any money?
You are talking about tax returns, which one is yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about $60 million.
I have a plot of land in Prague worth $25 million, an apartment worth $10 million, another apartment worth $8 million, a collection of works of art worth about $10 million, an Aston Martin worth $3.5 million, and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth $1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid’s dream: I always loved James Bond, who drove cars, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
Are you driving an Aston Martin, have a fortune worth 60 million and don’t have money for your campaign?
Want to change the Republic but don’t want to invest your own money in it?
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million dollars in the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsors shows that my program does not arouse great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, paying for my son's English school, which costs 30 grand a month.
If my only goal was to win money, I would not run in any election.
Are you going to continue your business so that you can live?
Didn't you say you'd mute your activities?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take over the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I must live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that true adventures are not only a matter of imagination. To be convinced, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
“I think this building is funny, it looks very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,” Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the street side, tells us.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large neighboring company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Nowadays, nobody goes to one of those nasty libraries voluntarily, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give back some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty little miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get their hands on the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV architects' office, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of spirited and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a laugh on his face.
And while the jury members were still staring at each other, bewildered and shrugging, Maas, the bold one, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments with a: "Common dear!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain spilled out of the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and semi-detached houses for a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this dull little town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of astonishing ugliness, whose white facades invite you to think that they house a dairy, has been enriched with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under the cheese bell.
Certainly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you step on the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the floor made of Dutch bricks and elegant street lights speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls who play ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, the library shelves are located along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” explains Willy Maas.
We have completely upended the classical spatial configuration and opened up the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been cleverly arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
Thus, one day we found in a Frisian agricultural enterprise an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, one-millimeter-thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and it saves time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal humidity level of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books lies beneath a glass bell, the sun illuminates the interior only for a short time, even on good weather days.
The thick wooden beams mounted sideways with respect to the glass facade serve as a sun visor, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The ambiance is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "soul finally found".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has helped fill the gaps in the library that was not yet fully filled (today, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays overflow from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, “there is nothing worse than a half-empty library.”
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it’s just for decoration.”
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Although it may seem young and poorly educated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians' request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 insurgency in Libya, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Eventually, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany struggling to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy as it were defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are fighting on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still groping to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy actually mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national dossiers.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, that is, by its exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany’s stance on the Middle East conflict and abstention in the UN vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to clash with public opinion, but also with the elites of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt that this is a decisive factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is, in any case, a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I think the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus shown that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
The United States, on the other hand, announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Is Germany struggling to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes things easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must affirm their singular position.
This is what they are currently doing on the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will take on a locomotive role in the future and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relations with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Is Germany playing a key role on the international stage, does Germany just want to take on a key role?
Or does it always have difficulty assuming leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still having difficulty playing a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn’t make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to deal with neighbors and very varied opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European politics is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this gap, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
And even if they do not like it, even if it is unpleasant for them and if they are less appreciated, it is life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, D.C., an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America jointly analyze the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialised in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd win the case.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s Far East property law firm.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few extra letters to be able to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a folder in which registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office can be found.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually only counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: its constituents charge him with addressing the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is by this term that women who marry rich men are referred to.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to complain about.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” Pattloch said.
"The brand is sweetened, the uniqueness disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive flagships.
According to data from market analysis firm CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion, the world's third-largest and fastest-growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is not easy to delete dubious registrations from the trademark registry and these procedures are expensive.
They can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch cites trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long time, the criticized name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, as he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's acquirer, used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing admits, however, that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office reportedly went last year from a "situation of emergency in the course of work to a normality found".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were reportedly closed, representing a 75% increase over the previous year.
Nonetheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and means that China is at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world for the tenth time in a row.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each record earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese plagiarist.
Certainly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components to be suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because surnames can’t be protected in Germany,” says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office therefore rejected the objection of the Munichians.
Freudenberg certainly won in the next two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is required
The case is currently pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "the procedure is long, strenuous and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs, and the Archives department has even had to review the records of the past hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered the opposing party a "large six-digit euro sum" to settle the dispute.
“That’s what we see what it means to us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could still have prevented the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Watchfulness is required."
Pattloch and him advised German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather "register also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Hitting, Singing, Helping
The Imbongi choir rehearses in Heidelberg, and Swaziland’s AIDS orphans rejoice at their arrival.
This is the story of a link that spans far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we tap with the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, pumps for ladies and loafers for men look for the rhythm by hitting the floor with the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they get carried away, bewitch and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
It is Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years came, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorister has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Being Helped to Help Yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide have the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "singer of praise" in Zulu.
No one can fluently speak the Bantu language in this area, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to now return it to its native region: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometres as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest straw or dirt huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the ills that plague Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population hardly ever accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is carrier of the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in their mid-thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis especially saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
In the beginning, it was just a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, an association that has since dealt almost professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, the rate of chlamydia-related infections is significantly higher than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are among young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, in Germany, human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been decreasing.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, lower abdomen pain and the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can decrease the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or through close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who frequently changes sexual partners take regular examinations.
Most early-stage STIs can be cured and late-stage sequelae can be prevented.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that choristers collect through their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulating.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated, for example in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, so called the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof over their heads and ensure that they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not of course, because although the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wifes
“AIDS is a real taboo,” explains Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a sexual issue.”
It is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
But there are condoms on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to promote some cultural exchange, the Imbongi choristers travel together every two or three years in the South of Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know about the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is such a sign of recognition that it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears away from some fearsome border guards.
The bus still takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," say the people there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers in a bird's-eye, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choirs that tap their feet in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently plunged into the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably came from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a connection between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other life-sustaining elements arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which one observes the infinite.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union's new definition of the term.
This detail from an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the birthing room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where the stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope has photographed the flaming brightness of a dying star.
The donut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, star clusters also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope highlights the colors more.
In this infrared image, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent earned it the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors on the Spitzer telescope have been able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the biggest puzzles in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturnian moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs ever taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the glowing heart of the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentary: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don’t like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname “Southern Fire Wheel.”
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This photo was made from optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
The circle of black holes can be seen 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosetta Nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the big bang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and thanks to them, it has been possible to see further and further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by leveraging the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of almost 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which observes the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope is also expected to be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows us to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been providing us with images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the mission began.
This photo illustrates the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists believe that Mercury’s South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data has indicated the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live to be 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is also a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years old.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is also a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years old.
The journey into the Talysh Mountains is of a shattered romanticism.
Along the many turns of the road, the small bus bumps along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it almost feels like in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which little is known, except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and have a very long lifespan.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plasters with its overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture that does not match the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too arduous.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be here the festival of the oldest people in the world," explains Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only such museum in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he reached the age of 120.
Having a child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he still had a daughter.
Did <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov miscalculate his age by a few decades?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about the old man in Central Asia.
“Surprisingly elderly people also live in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the non-existence of the documents, apart from the fact that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is nevertheless a fact that the people of the Lerik area often reach an age worthy of the Bible patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tour guide, explains that Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a question of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a shed, whose contents she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long since grown up.
There are also two small children in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armoury glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf lie long braids of a dark blond that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, and this is how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I have never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly Retirement is Enough to Live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who still ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats a month (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good way of life in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grayed son is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft Sharia-based constitution is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not avaricious in words filled with emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he told state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also especially for Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For all the members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily drafted by the majority-Islamic Constituent Assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour nighttime roundup are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists are using the vague formulation and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case, it suggests that a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all subjects related to sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance shines on the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will oversee the legislative apparatus, which would lead de facto to the placing under guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts worked to suppress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording implying that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi puts to the vote and which, in his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution was reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in unusual harmony in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, promising to bring down sharia law before it takes effect.
"The revolution is reborn and we are going to win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft constitution is "to be thrown into the trash can of history."
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned,” said Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition, according to Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "the people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean up our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Koran [was their] Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that’s what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken out loud.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide at the polls what direction the country should take.
The project of the Islamists will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regretted during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi’s powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto strips it of all its powers,” Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which watches the battle between the different political ideologies on the Nile bank with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be related to the locals' appetite for extremely smelly fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most prized dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this ubiquitous smell permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt sprinkled trout and fermented in water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness sets in and it is cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
“You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also known as “Rakfisk General,” who is in charge of running the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it’s not bad – it sounds like a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barrels of airtight water, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, though odorous, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> each.
Norway is not often mentioned in international news, which is not to its displeasure.
Here, people are unwilling to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about the “July 22 incident.”
The Norwegians are struggling to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own might have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success,” explains Anna, our waitress, with blond hair and pierced blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray in her hand.
We are, as you say, cautious people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything except a small percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out of the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the strings of its purse tight.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and queue to buy myself something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger made of impulse, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I'm staying in is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most odorous of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter carries a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It was like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish fumes.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a tough start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic is legion in normal times, a security dam has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico’s economy is doing well, with results owed to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is plagued by a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populated and sprawling state that encircles the capital. On his favorite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevices.
Plaques bearing his name are hung on the outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to put in place lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and of Mr Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.
In terms of security and economics in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who blame the new president for lack of charisma.
He is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that the people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.
Hidden under highway highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly severe.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place infamous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the cadaveric stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was refused.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they're saying and shut up.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make it his priority during his term.
“I hope he will be as good as he was as president when he was governor,” Olvera told Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of mistreatment allegedly made by Bradley Manning during his detention.
The trial concerns Manning’s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's abduction took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to show on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. military history -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims he suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein stated that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed an application requiring that Manning be dismissed on the grounds that the abduction took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- came a day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
The military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers had filled out after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards gave him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received inside the prison was overall "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had orally expressed concerns about certain issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not record the issues raised.
“They wrote ‘no problem’ (after addressing concerns), and yet that didn’t mean I didn’t raise any problems,” Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in a January 2011 interview with the special commission that met to discuss suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed to indicate a “risk of injury.”
The military said they had assigned him that restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted to be removed from that status ... so that I could have a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered committing suicide while in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay on the move, because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning’s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked for a night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge’s questions on Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard’s order that he should drop his cover that might have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic in his briefs or flip flops to injure himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he had during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is convicted in a court martial, a trial that is expected to be held early next year.
The defense said Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious offenses and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors arguing that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been detained in accordance with the rules governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defense.
If all charges are retained, he faces life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says the Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two routes: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which way to go.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" all my life.
It’s an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves “Irish,” or my friends in New York when they call themselves “Italian.”
Then I became a Mexican-American.
But here it was Mexico.
And in the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualification or a hyphen.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed to the "Foreigners" queue.
I thought about that moment of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk it in the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada, and create a Trade Union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and bitter.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing at the point of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are undermining their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's children are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about bitterness?
There are a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and its losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a relative or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person was a typical profile -- dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, going to good schools and having good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they roast us as if we were inferior and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexican-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel that they are part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a great country to visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not going to happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive pay inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to do it alone, amigos.
That's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old disputes, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments persist for who started, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet, there is every reason to think that it could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers and no winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is maintained, this week’s fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has been beaten.
Having killed some of its leaders and pushed back the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza into one of the most miserable and overpopulated corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of its rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing stronger, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken up the cause of Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members rejoice and say that the Islamist crescent is bent around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah militia exerts its dominance, to Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on Israel’s southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to rely on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as a major player that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back into a box.
The missile interception system dubbed Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being behind the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza rocket fire has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared from suicide bombings, notably thanks to the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more bellicose party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman ahead of the January 22 election, has the nice part.
Why pamper these damn Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were to run the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they come out of the head.
Perhaps the hardliners will win; but the Arab Spring may be a game changer.
Even if the Islamists who seize power in Egypt and elsewhere have little appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire that bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in Israeli-occupied territories — much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions to Gaza every two or three years to ring the bell of Hamas will come at a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to end the flow of arms to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packs come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law came into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible pictures of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small print on all the packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous depiction.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed for example that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.
Tobacco makers said it would revive black market trade, which will give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
“There will be harmful consequences from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters of China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said demand for cigarette cases, including silicone cases to hide hideous packaging, had risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain’s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in Australia’s high court.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only downside, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the slice of population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV ads, sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by local businesses and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you’re working in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some citizens in favor of brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has bothered to make a video, or if this is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulation in effect rather than marketing.
The industry went so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions – these countries told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos mandatory on packaging in 2001.
These warnings are now being issued in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I'm ignoring them.
"You take a cigarette and you put the package away," Victor El Hage said as he bought a package with a picture of a mouth tumor.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack Tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of the packages made it difficult to store the packages on the shelves.
“Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and we put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development are praising boredom.
It’s perfectly normal for us – and our children – to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nurture creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Oh, yes, yes.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back a long way," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, dating back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give of boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing numerous publications and submitting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "wanting to do something, but failing to engage in a satisfying activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the disruption of the attention process, associated with a moody mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be linked, people who get bored tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” which was published in the journal “Perspectives on Psychological Science” in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants were listening on cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some bands heard, coming from the next room, the too loud sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard low-noise TV said they were more bored than the other two groups - they struggled to concentrate, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or busy task, a disruption in attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
In contrast, when you perform a boring task, “like looking at objects on a editing line, music can help you not get bored.”
In fact, he says, now we know that when you twist or scratch, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to sleep learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "bore predisposition scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, “Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasted.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today's boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” not least because children and teens don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Boring is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t have learned to take care of himself or self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation goes from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, he gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Nor do I think we should criticize him.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant bubbling of business and technology is the goal we should aim for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens a keen and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana dumplings and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he and some friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor offenses, each with a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on location than on the law.
Here and in Washington state, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving marijuana use have been filed without prosecution.
Police have stopped indicting adults 21 and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative ridings have called for accelerating existing marijuana cases and continue to indict those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-licensed marijuana shops in their neighborhoods.
“Things are moving so fast that I don’t know what the future holds,” said Daniel J. Oates, the Aurora police chief, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators also have a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a permit system, permitting the production, manufacture, distribution and sale - by the December 1, 2013, deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for therapeutic use and now for personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and it’s a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent we could build on,” he said.
Washington’s law, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the permit system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state mandate that ensures appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis-selling shops within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or nursery.
“There will be no harder places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Cannabis Legalization, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates in Aurora sent an email to his officers announcing that the City Attorney would no longer prosecute people 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that police should stop indicting people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said police would enforce the new court orders that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to handle marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those who committed a crime that, at the time of the incident, was a recognized offense," Buck said.
The reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana-restricted initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, are no longer bringing in adults for possession of limited quantities.
County Public Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to proceed with all marijuana detention cases.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and governmental framework appropriate for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
“This is a cultural barrier” with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent a good part of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they’re struggling to accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are on track to become a case law for drug legalization.
As advocates and state officials envision a new frontier of legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting directives from the federal government, which still regards the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of legalizing marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will cede.
Despite some publicized arrests of medical marijuana patients and salespeople, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana retailers to practice in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While it’s true that police aren’t likely to break through the doors to seize small bags of drugs, there’s a good chance they’re opposed to licensed personal-use marijuana businesses authorized under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration policy adviser.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana-selling businesses, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose that ban next week.
“We don’t want to end up in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in community voting rather than state voting.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was beaten up and kicked out of Oxford because I was a Tory.
It’s not just today’s students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowledge, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheater that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduates had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said in a facet that I had left after being forced to drink in splintered cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been bullied and subjected to constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and the same reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative Party supporter.
Why talk about it today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students is experiencing the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Student Room (JCR) said they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want a representative on the University's Equal Opportunities Committee so that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which focused on student politics and portrayed "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among them was the student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) ", who moves in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and moves with a chrome head cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as scapegoats for setting up rising tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left bias in universities.
"People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who has put forward a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right.
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought this way during my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and a paralyzing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, because of reduced funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was filled with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when the new students got to know each other and the professors, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I found that teachers not only participated in the sarcasm of Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy about strike miners, privatization and the government’s opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa were engraved in the woods of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I experienced was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, was easily carried away.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
“I suggest you take French lessons in your free time – if you’re not too busy making friends,” he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat down alone and felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, gently.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even harder for you.
Most Tory youth claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher had said.
This scheme has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took up the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have just lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people with similar views only after dark?
Should I have become a Labour Party and renounced my views?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of her speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my family and more open-minded city friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreaming bell towers.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a session of directed work the following week, when another history professor suggested the most seriously in the world that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Internally blushing with shame, I admitted to being the victim of my parents' brainwashing and called them "old madmen".
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who pushed the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch’s press each week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a wet, whimpering chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his fashion house over the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there is an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest couturier of the northern Italian city of Voghera to the idol of international jet-setting.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of beauties of the past such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade in the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during Haute-Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
"He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Parade of Nobility Lineage
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared loves.
He likes people who are well-educated and with the greatest titles and they like him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamour podium of sixty meters wide that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade on the podium to admire a "public" of dreams wearing the main creations of Valentino, such as the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristotle Onassis, or the suit that he wore in No.
Among this public of models are such names as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentino’s first clothes are like first love, “impossible to forget”.
I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, a shirt, a gilet vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier's muses.
“I prefer it to all the others for its femininity, its great love of women, and because it sublimates our beauty,” adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Eventually, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a drop-neckline.
"It was a dream come true," Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow said.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the couturier with "the utmost care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that she carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the seamstress calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of lace and a four-and-a-half meter trail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of haute couture of the end of the 20th century, "the return of high society clients".
Obsessed for years with the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any husband of his clients.
"His refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped at me," d'Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The Toughest Job in the World: Kawah Ijen’s Human Mules
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with air.
After harvesting large sulfur rocks, weighing a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano which peaks at 2,386 meters above sea level, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur extracted.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 meters altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, we can say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to bleach sugar.
“Because we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he finishes exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is triple what he would gain in the fields.
“The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the bearer who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they row to Islam, where they are Hindus, and I am a Hindu.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Struggling with life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the job of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wooden stall with other bearers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning as sulfur does not cease to gush at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by illuminating himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not receive a sub of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of surcharge per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not humans,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old body carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for 30 years since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders.
By balancing the basket on his back, 53-year-old Unainik can only carry 50 kilos.
Each day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away by a goat trail overgrown with weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik said, opening his mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult professions in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans lay the blame for this childlessness on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem implausible that these lyrics come from an advertisement for mint pellets, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polichinelle in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way with this ad.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended for the Internet only, so we were able to make it fun and entertaining.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt it was a theme that we needed to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought to ourselves, what could be more creative to solve this problem than to turn it into a rap song?
1.2 Children
The government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on politics to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, said it was due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation,” she says.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and failing to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he acknowledged that the new standards gave clearer instructions to developers, who had previously been put a stick in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small dwellings in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If so that these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking with Singaporeans who work in the central financial district, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people put it off,” says one young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," another 20-year-old tells us.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
So while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the final say.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for children under 16?
How to apply this definition in daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he exposes himself by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term “something very personal” on a personal level and “password and username” when they applied it to social networks.
“I’m not going to reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says Jorge, 10, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone,” he says.
On FB, I post nice images or games.
I also talk with my friends.
“I’m not going to share one of my pictures or someone who would be a fool,” he said.
The boy admits that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly,” he says.
He says he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust anyone who would recommend him a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter he admits not knowing 20 of the people registered on his friends list.
“I’m not worried because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one made any advances or asked for his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account,” he said.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are not unfamiliar to the young boy.
A friend of mine was hacked into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just passed it on to a private profile."
He then explains to us a series of manipulations to configure his account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or upset.
“Even though I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she said.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and young people who are born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a definite criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or said at an age when they do not have the maturity necessary to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is to use questions that make them think.
“Their saying not to do it is useless,” she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Outside of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social media,” she said.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education adviser, said it was essential for parents to read the terms of use of social networks conscientiously.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what it is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The UNASUR summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 mandataries present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of UNASUR Heads of State and Government, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the end of the summit, then said it would be published at any time on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by Peruvian President Ollante Humala in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly restricted.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulating among the journalists was given by the press attachés of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document leaked during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the summit’s “final declaration,” but it was President Humala’s speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America-Arab Countries (ASPA) Summit and, on that occasion, although it had been urged to do so by the press, it had also not issued the declaration also known as the Lima Declaration, as had previously been announced.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the obtaining of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that settles a border difference between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ’s decision to hear the pleas of both sides in the Lima trial against Santiago that begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we have today before this international court,” Humala said, speaking alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country respectful of international law, the peaceful resolution of international controversies, treaties and tribunals,” Piñera said, shaking hands with President Humala alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from UNASUR since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of $ 17 million of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against international organized crime, actions for better accessibility to medicines, access to cheap Internet throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to envision a better future for our populations," concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give further details.
Similarly, the outcome document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," he said.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through an ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these avenues, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask to have a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the seizure of power of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers will meet in advance to endorse the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.
“South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take the example of Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the 6th summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told state television, TV Perú, that Europeans "had killed each other during the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"Free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president supported the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of diminishing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on human rights.
Those who clapping our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa says he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but has instead respected his "deep democratic and human rights values".
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish courts that demanded that he submit to an interrogation on his territory regarding an alleged sexual offense while "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I have not spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian president said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being enclosed in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“It affects anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the assignment of a safe haven that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he stresses that he had founding discussions in London in order to find a solution to the problem.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings in different European instances,” he said.
And he thinks that “if Britain granted the safe haul as early as tomorrow, it would end.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows, and as it has already done in other cases, were to question Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or were to question him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malevolent or perverse politicians but bad journalists on the payroll of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than highlighting his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts," because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We have to solve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the proper resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and affirmed that it is "beneficial for Latin America to refer to international bodies if both countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it may be".
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would withdraw from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this eventual victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and I will then withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I will too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of President Chavez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths today are due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test result was confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful" in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inquire about him and his relentlessness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmas.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless."
In those days, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as a reference that this information was validated in April of this year.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system involvement patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those with CD rates up to 50 years for those who do not use drugs: up to a CD rate of 50 for those with a CD rate of up to 30 years for those who do not use drugs.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who would receive an HIV-positive diagnosis at age 25, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," the scientist explained.
In order to put this progress in context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths as of May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we have never been short of drugs, the problem is that patients reach very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or else they learn it in advanced stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, we must offer massive screening tests to all people who ask for it.”
Specialists and members of the Jalisco State Council for AIDS Prevention (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from carcinoma.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better that I have fun three times a week,” they say, not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To date, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sex life, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World AIDS Day.
If they do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packets of one hundred, it is very good, but it results, that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
He proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but that they be found in distributors in public toilets and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying for the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
“This is not how sexuality works, the best thing is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,” he said.
Numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the 4th state in the country in the number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections occur through sexual contact, 6% through blood and 2% through perinatal contact.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who are unaware of it.
A ruling upheld by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, setting a damaging precedent for all domestic companies with ramifications in the neighboring country and having solvency problems.
Thus, it seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the starry flag, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgement handed down on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s top glassmaker to sue the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case notes that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, states that the main proceeding is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as its arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro's subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, i.e. vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A fact omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation it faced since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For now, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same appeals court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and requires the trial to be reviewed by a higher court, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that this freed him from agreements signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had complied with the United Nations Commission on International Trade principles, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they assuage Vitro and they assuage the country.
General balance sheet
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were silenced for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Aviation Pilots Union Association has already encountered problems.
The case, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the trust F/589 of the bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They besiege the Dragon Mart
A group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a living area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the Southeast Zone to oppose the monumental project that is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
The government has put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was a good thing that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was considered an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In order to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, the real estate developer Homex has launched into the market of the Stock Exchange for 500 million pesos.
This is the first of four issues for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth of Competival

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The basketball globetrotter "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the field and, thanks to him, traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to wheelchair use in 2008, Reyes had been immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower-league player, basketball national team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the fed.
"I have worn several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 90s," Reyes recalled during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamón, where he has resided with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball is my whole life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his extraordinary itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves most are those that remind him of his time as a player on the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
“These were my best years, the ones that I enjoyed the most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
This is a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired at the championship in 1981, the year that Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), he said to me, "I have a strong player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
That's how to start Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was delighted with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's positions in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we got 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn’t let us play the last game,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the World Cup of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy in the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hurruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team made up of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have left to do?
There are things that I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys play only in their zone and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips from my time on YouTube, take advantage of my grandchildren, and occasionally attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, his press secretary Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he was living life to the full," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas," Hagman had made a name for himself on television in the role of an ordinary guy on the NBC series "Jinny of My Dreams" from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an enticing genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film roles include critically acclaimed roles in "The Band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was through his masterful portrayal of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman achieved his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan “Who Killed J.R.?”, invented to fuel suspense around an emotionally charged episode in which Hagman’s character is nearly murdered, has generated worldwide speculation and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled this Friday Hagman as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life."
It’s unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who’ve had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Recording for five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is underway, the channel said.
So far, neither Warner nor TNT has said how Hagman’s death will be included in the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who rose to fame with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on stage in New York theaters in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met and married the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les mémoires impitoyables de J.R)
“I haven’t written anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist concerned patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to have surgery and then," he says in 1996.
I’m trying to offer them some comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a little while, but it’s going to be fine.”
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when Charmed Religion Professor Stuart decided to give a lesson on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistible hook: the end of the "great tally" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, which many people refer to as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmed had no idea what awaited him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal chasm that some have dubbed “the Armageddon of debt” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists thought the apocalypse would unfold.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Charmed told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and tell it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to give classes on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled “The End of the World.”
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn’t disappear,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The classes proved to be quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” Restall said of his 35-student high-level course.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us they believed in the end-of-the-world date of December 21.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and somehow we discredited it,” says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old senior at Temple, West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a rise in this speculation.
“In other places around the globe, people don’t think about that,” he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew there were classes here on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years there has been talk of the many supposed dates of the Last Judgment, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they thought they were going to “end-of-the-world” parties.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
