The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative crash.
After the collapse of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
Transactions of CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this decline is the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
Thus, even from us, there is a market reaction to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
Breakdown of shares in Asia
Asian stocks experienced a dramatic crash on Tuesday, although the indices, however, later cancelled some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cancelled almost 4%, but later also a part of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange were losing more than 5%, but in the end the losses stood at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan stock market, according to the local index, fell 3.6 percent.
“The planning of the bailout action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world,” said Hong Kong bureau chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, therefore without dependence on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposed financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also suffer the consequences.
Massacre of American stocks
The U.S. Parliament on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which $700 billion (almost 12 trillion Czech kroner) was to be allocated.
Lawmakers have thus ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a slaughter and major stock indices saw their biggest crash in more than two decades.
The Dow Jones fell by almost 7% and a similar collapse was last seen in 1987.
The index was down already before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has given in: the U.S. government can give $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an understanding of economic support for the U.S. financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on approving the bailout in the form of economic aid to the U.S. financial system for a total of $700 million (almost 12 trillion kroner).
But it is not yet said.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
Later, however, we will have a return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, to reach the help of the markets.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
“We’ve made a big step forward.”
"We have clarified our differing views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Delegates of the legislators met on the night of Saturday and Sunday with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give final shape to the government’s financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and put the stability of the entire system at risk.
“We are in the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.”
“It’s necessary to continue the remediation plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis is falling heavily on the stock markets, which are collapsing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are thus trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of Congress.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two Houses of Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can stop at the last moment on some issue.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount envisaged for the support of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has called for.
But Congress can block the rest of the money if it feels the program doesn’t do its job, blocking the next $100 billion and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may overwhelm his right to veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained,i.e. to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage securities, whose price has collapsed because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We have processed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday’s bill and the Senate on Monday,” the Republican senator said.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s positive development and appreciated “the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of gold parachutes
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief spokesman, said lawmakers had agreed on responsibility for the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the budget from cuts, splitting the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard and we’ve taken a big step toward the deal that will work and be beneficial to the market and also to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan relies on the help of homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage instalments it will buy with the goal of lowering monthly expenses on instalments for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because we don’t know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government divide losses between them,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so crucial.
“Most importantly, this week the representatives of the congress will find an agreement on the support of this plan and christen it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this time more important," Marek stressed.
Duel to the last blood: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
This makes it clear that it is best to buy only the phone.
However, there are many reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is not even an objective reason.
If, however, hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls are crowded on your shelves, you probably dream of a turntable like this.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here too there are the price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly digest the twenty-crown headphones of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is the life of the batteries that decides.
Some high-quality music players can do a lot more than just read music, but cell phones don’t do it by accident.
There is no other device as universal as the mobile phone.
Next to the primary functions, phone and text, it can read music and videos, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even can navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and handhelds, you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle that no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the mobile and the sooner the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
Reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap cell phones, don’t count on them to last for more than a few hours.
If you still add, from time to time, some calls, get to work for safety another charger, this applies even to the most expensive appliances.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours at continuous functionality on a charge.
An additional problem exists when downloading music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do without an adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for a few exceptions (iPod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players create a media library by themselves, sorted by performers' names, album name, genre, or user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device, you are mainly interested in the battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If you use music mainly as a background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you only need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This is now possible on any mobile phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about which formats your phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the majority of the global music that comes to them will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is poor and is limited, usually, only to hits of the moment of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (either via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phones behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to a little something peeks in their pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on this, if you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small portion of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best and technically most equipped mobile phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15,000 crowns.
But the advantage of the readers is, in addition to others, the easy handling.
The simplest ones are not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) and anyone can really handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally bumping into the start-up of the mobile internet and consequently a giant bill for data transmission.
Which Appliance to Take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (such as M2, microSD, etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, you fall into the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models support only cards with the maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, take the specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service so it comes close to the same MP3 player.
In this area Sony Ericsson has made more way, which phones of the line walkman have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players from the above brands ensure the same service and price range up to 4,000 kroner, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, typically up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Possibly.
Perhaps the mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services like their partners in Western Europe.
Here, however, something is missing – a virtual operator that forces the traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for long.
Of the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end, <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> also confirmed this, pointing out that the price of SMS is higher in us than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regularisation of roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in relation to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to start the fight.
Maybe it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage highly above 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense he also often emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) , Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network no longer has many possibilities. (Also perhaps it would be difficult now to find other frequencies).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a significant lowering of prices, to which then the traditional operators should have reacted.
At the same time, even before sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar rumours resonated in Britain as we did.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can be really successful.
In the end, we do not have to go very far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator has managed to win over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, to which in the Czech Republic it belongs, among other things, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
To be able to function effectively, that is, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry behind,that is, relatively high expenses for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually come at low cost, offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the offer of services more restricted
So for example Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that cost at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a pretty good move even betting on a target group not a small one.
This operator so to speak focuses specifically on men.
"Real men choose Mobilking operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can affirm a similar concept as in Poland.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, a spokesman for Vodafone, said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators rely.
In addition from the point of view of services is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"There is talk of the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have many expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in the other countries of our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, the press spokeswoman of the financial group Penta, told Mobile.cz in a telephone dialogue.
Thus he indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not very supportive of this thinking.
Rather, they try to do everything so that no potential competitors are created.
For some time he has not hidden his interest in the launch of a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefonica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the sooner the better.
We have negotiated repeatedly on this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," said Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual operator will have to have it perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, around his creation stands an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has turned to us," mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the press section of Telef<0xC3><0xB2>nika O2.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by the other operators.
T-Mobil press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build."
“In the T-Mobil network, it is unlikely that a virtual operator will appear by the end of the year.
At this point we should have had a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon.”
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting its 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: “We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators and this especially in the context of sharing of expenses and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of the customers, the most productive.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Competent authorities -with complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around the U:fon creation testify that when operators care about one thing they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> during the period of U:fon's creation towards the T-Mobile company.
This is evidenced by publicly accessible information from <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for not accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has only recently been enhanced after all with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Regarding the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on him and above all on his services."
The attitude of mobile operators is surprising, however, the complete disinterest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> which unfortunately in the Czech Republic – unlike Britain and other developed countries – has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, in relation to the whole problem has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the bid from potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS External Relations Section in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
Instead, the office has to defend the interests of consumers and, moreover, ensure that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, it is more than a delicate affair.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Overseas where virtual operators commonly operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost thrilling harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises on its own.
Just as the identical price of gasoline for all gas stations is undoubtedly the result of coincidence and competition.
"The section has found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its behavior in the market.
The necessary tools for the opening up of the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of controversy.
Of course, there is the analysis of relevant markets by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has – after all, logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a minimum of alarming that three mobile operators proceed in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints from the parties concerned (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Discharging responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS keeps itself out of the whole affair.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved update of the telecommunications law, despite the fact that many experts expected the situation to improve.
This fact the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
It can be done, when no one looks
Unbeknownst to us, the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, some of which even exist in Czech mobile networks, remains.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, but they are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-established people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company vis-à-vis the operator appears as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
“If the cases you are talking about, which we will be interested in, are presented, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and it could result in the conclusion of the cooperation with that company,” Martina Kemrová replied to the question in question.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they derive a profit that is not indifferent and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not harmed in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as regular customers of mobile operators.
But just that should be a strange minimum at <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another issue opens up for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has rights strong enough to expose similar activities and if it does not want to, it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of everything and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer expensive
As the text has already been said several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant reduction in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators were more or less trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - market too small, at the limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in developed countries precisely in these cases have intervened the regulatory bodies to defend not the mobile operators but their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then we came to the creation of the first virtual operator and to him others were attached.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies throw themselves from one to the other like a boiling potato.
From our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw in the towel.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will really appear soon from us, the Czech mobile market will get back on track.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only <0xC3><0x9A>OHS could hardly remain impassible to the refusal (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with the male or female voice, chorus pass and instrumental edition.
The singing is under the direction of Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the website iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before he told the radio "<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the solo variants, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried to make sure that both and also the choir, have a clear diction, that the text is well understandable, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j" was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original work Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers who will have an electronic card in their pockets instead of the paper ticket will board the metro, tram and bus.
At the moment about one hundred thousand people who own their Opencard can get it.
Passengers can buy the 30-day and 90-day and annual one (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged at the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the metro station Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>h<0xC4><0x97> Rabyyrov<0xC4><0x97>, Kobyy.
The coupons can be bought since yesterday on the internet at the Compagnia dei Trasporti website www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the internet service can completely forget the counters at the metro stops where they had to make long queues for paper tickets until now.
The coupon is purchased via the Internet and on the Opencard it is charged on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have at their disposal a counter with trained personnel that will help those interested in purchasing on the internet and will also record on their card the credit acquired," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to upload the electronic vouchers on the Opencards in ATMs and self-service that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they resemble the obliterators of tickets and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are now five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> concluded.
The coupon will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and upon payment of the coupon, it will load on it.
The electronic tiles are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is in the urban lines of trains and buses from the number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added to the integrated transport in Prague there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they check the time and zone validity," explained the mode of control of Filip tickets by the organization Ropid, which fine-tunes the schedules of collective transport in Prague.
City buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s case.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the determined point next to the checkout.
Thus the driver checks the validity of the loaded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the vouchers uploaded, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take city buses and will not remember, when the validity of the coupon expires, can again go to the ATMs self-service, where the coupons are loaded on the card.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include <0xC5><0xA0>umava in the United States.
This results from the letter deposited in the Southern Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, it is said, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This is moreover the result of the letter preserved in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow again the return of the “district of <0xC5><0xA0>umava” – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter said, signed with the words "The people who care about the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava with all their heart."
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives Sudeten Germans hope only for brutality, lack of regard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter beg the American president to assume the protectorate over <0xC5><0xA0>umava now and always.
“We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and uproots ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, just nothing, to the victory of the Allies,” the letter said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge on the part of the “Czech oppressors”.
If the president of the United States were to doubt the conviction of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the willingness of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the mastery of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem na<0xC3><0xAF>ve to our knowledge of the post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the then expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Even if the Czech Germans had to guess that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp at Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him for him to teach him Czech.
“They thought that once they got home, the Czech would be comfortable,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia during the war, relied on the fact that on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
You don't think - you'll pay!
The Emotional Campaign Will Attack the Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, one could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet, and flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put on his belt before leaving.
It wants to touch in the conscience especially young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and not least the professional drivers.
What will appear in the commercials?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his life.
The commercials will "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of accident victims.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"With the drivers, the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or accident.
It is necessary to remind drivers of the risk," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án of the Na Homolce hospital.
And so you need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed warning panel has been installed, it will probably soon become confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warns.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to leave the same percentage to the Palestinians (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He has admitted that the eventual return will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want scrapers or planers to pass on him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which lie within the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
The retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was the prerequisite for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from the Golan," he warned.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get to the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up the permanent support, which they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (Shiite movement) of Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards in buses illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you can not walk on the bus that makes long-distance routes
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus company Student Agency came the question if the stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the ride.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
Last week’s accident in which a 22-year-old stewardess was killed was caused by a truck cutting off the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the bus’s less secure seat at the time, although there were still two other seats allocated.
But the bus can make an accident or brake sharply even when distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus has standing seats according to the driving licence.
If not approved, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency buses have no standing seats, the company’s director Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x95>.cz.
“We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
Afterwards it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the ride if they have the seat assigned," he expressed his point of view.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role.”
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from carrying out the services.
The road traffic law only recognizes the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds less clearly spokesperson Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law takes sufficient care of this problem.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing seats.
That's all," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban where there are standing seats and limited maximum speed, intercity with standing seats with higher maximum speed and long distance without standing seats with maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet ride there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on planes.
Even there it is not safe when turbulence comes and the flight attendant can hit his head.”
"If the bus brakes sharply, of course the laws of physics apply.
Same as on the city bus or tram.
The transport company must solve the safety of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also intends that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards.
It takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director considers their job dangerous.
“As soon as I have the feeling that I have to regard the stewardship profession as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
They would also reduce expenses," he says.
Asiana’s director Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of the lines compared to the Student Agency, justified the absence of the stewards on his vehicles as an interest in security.
“We don’t have hostesses, we’ve been opposing them from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz said less than a year ago.
An immense tragedy has happened.
In the accident of the line to Naples, a young stewardess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had worked for the company for two years, died.
A Slovenian truck probably exited the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but hit it with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejected the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-distance buses, they are unobtainable."
The company intends to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarification of the movement of stewarts on board buses.
“They have not achieved any concrete results.
They are not considered as much by buses, they deal more with the score system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewarts as a major threat to the safety of passengers," Havelka concludes with this that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the security offices.
Dusseldorf's hopes are on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the director of the WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published Monday that could form "the capital market center of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of units of the bank of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch “a competent block” with lasting profits in such a venture.
In addition, such a union could be a decisive impetus for further links in the sector of the Länder banks.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the afflicted WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU commission, but also through the National Authority for the Financial Supervisory Service, having long ago pointed out to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in search of a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the clients of the Savings Banks themselves already know because of their investment funds, and the WestLB have certainly been talked about for quite some time, even by Frankfurt.
The head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas said at the presentation of the first half of the year’s turnover at the end of August that a merger of the house in via Mainz with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the board of directors of Deka, half of which is led by regional banks and consortia of savings banks, delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint bargaining.
It could be the trading of the market or parts of it.
The conversations, however, have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important in the business arena in Frankfurt, not mentioned for the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it seemed for a short time that the Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba.
Nothing was done about this three-way association.
As soon as the projects were published, the Hessian regional bank opposed Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank went instead to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have often thought about a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, chairman of the board of directors of the Helaba, spoke out against design games to reunite with his home.
Apart from that, it seems that knowledge is being created, that it is necessary for the different houses of the public sector to approach.
As the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could first take place.
This is not good news for Helaba at all.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, the partners will be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the homes in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of Hesse-Thuringia savings banks, which participates with 85 percent of the Helaba, put the lock on the meeting with the WestLB.
It would only remain the NordLB
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual homes fit together.
In June Merl pointed out that to the decisive question, with which business model the future of the regional banks would be secured, no response would yet be given by the association of German savings banks.
Eventually, the division of the West LB could also emerge, which of course is not desired by that.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
We will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive beard and shows to about 200 travelers what are the deep tones that it can produce from the throat.
Elena gives a kiss to Luca first and then a kiss to her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to the Porta Nuova station, four couriers leave this evening at 23.45 with destination Monaco, Beer Festival ", arrival scheduled at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so noisy, Marco says, that it’s not for Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with faux fur lining and a pair of glasses with wide silver stripes belong to the buses.
For 5 years they have been going to Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The night trip, during the day to the feast, I return at 10:30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the Bavarian norms of authenticity, the health insurance and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need their strength.
They stop in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others group together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On the left there is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiriviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent, it means running!", quotes Marco early in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, divide into the next space!"
The jar costs 8.25 Euros, Marco shouts.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 10:30 p.m., we'll meet here again, okay?"
We're already leaving for the party.
On the street one sticks as you follow away the yellow caps to the trees, to the road signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the holiday, known as "Italian weekend".
Exact data do not exist, we speak of 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Munich is reinforced with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where the Italians are in first place with 200 medical care before the British (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and furthermore mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started over the weekend.
THE real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks, in order to protect itself from the turmoil in the markets.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday that support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the affiliate Depfa.
The state lender according to a newspaper article refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserves fell by 95% to 2.37 million euros, while its equity share fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared to last year, earnings from increases in both demand and certain shares as well as the liquidation of provisions in loans fell by more than 70% on the 5 million Euros.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the return of subordinate compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate at about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 was lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were spun off into Aareal Bank.
Given that the income in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa committed itself more to infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group’s profit and loss account.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they had been reduced by two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is a major state and infrastructure lender.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between banks has largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually requires for a part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – around $50 billion. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate notice, the group's financial needs have been covered by credit for a period of time and the company is protected from the influence of mostly non-functioning international money markets.
From other sources it is heard, that thanks to the money the refinancing is assured until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE group would not need money markets anytime soon.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service (BaFin) rely on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still assured.
This is hoped for the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
Financing may not be fully utilized.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank, as it turned out, was about to fail, the momentary bailout failed to calm the mood.
The share price fell by 75% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.30.
They handle mortgages pretty well.
While the previous grade debts are almost immovable, the rates of the deferred credits are yielding.
Affected above all are the mortgages of the affiliate Württemberg-Hypo understandably the maturities beyond 2009.
Before the HRE loans seemed an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which with the relief of the Depfa has become the crisis, must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until the less damaged central banks, governments and banks are still ready, you can count on a depreciation of the annuities by the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, what no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But with regard to information overturned because of partial stateizations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will mainly create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors can conclude the carry-over of losses for future payments of the capital gains offset tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to show up at Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start giggling: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I even had a crush on going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road by myself and fortunately I didn’t miss it.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been set as we have in Lower Saxony.
Schoolchildren arrive slowly from 8 onwards, until at 8.40 a brief interview with the professor begins, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I posed in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, sneered and nodded, and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew this from my manga.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me grinned, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson had continued quietly, but when the gong rang, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They all talked messy and laughed and annoyed me with questions – then it’s really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the break everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me a basket for lunch - it's different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu ..
I don’t even know what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except for the plums put in salt, brrr!
Bento is not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a self-made Bento, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then to get to know the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my manga comics.
I'm really curious, if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Japan.
I've always said,
"Because it fascinates me"
I have been reading manga for years now.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started learning Japanese a little bit.
I was completely convinced that I would come once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends - on the other hand, strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is arranged well, I’ve never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a cockroach runs away when they feel danger.
Neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced that many animals have feelings as well.
4. But how could we check if, when we behave in our same way, they have our same feelings?
Articles by well-known scientists have been published in the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else ever being able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter an impracticable territory, because the base of reference does not fit.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do. That is, it pretends to be dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave similarly, where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feelings towards animals.
On the one hand, it often connects the lateral prefrontal cortex with human awareness, the associated circuits (this for its direct sharing of short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus admit the foundation on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should arise in the way man speaks: since a large part of life is connected with language, it is often said that it is connected with consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Though awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the animal’s awareness, as it is made, surely differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through one's own experience because of the special hardware, their research will pose us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would be easier to access.
One could analyze the processes of the consciousness of animals without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, in particular in the example of visualization.
Therefore, for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, we pass first to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for visualization implementation.
What, then, is delineated for feelings?
I imput them to the fact that an emotional system such as fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
Thus feelings are closely related to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and in particular the human being.
With the speaking nature subtle nuances of feeling are created, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions than the sensations of the cortex and the paleocephalus, similar to Jack Pankseep, who nevertheless focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what for rats and humans looks like fear, is probably felt that way with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
Does a cockroach in case of danger escape as if he also felt fear?
In my eyes the mere resemblance of behavior cannot yet demonstrate any vital resemblance.
And that is the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalus, the cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleobrain responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to humans, how would you want to prove it to rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, as long as you give up the same procedure on rats and men.
Just as I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t do research on their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than constantly bumping into a wall.
I am an emotionally practical person.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
Both host countries limp on the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of European stadiums will eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work with maximum speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparations for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
Many members of the first division only in the last season were convicted of manipulation, in the end it was even necessary to postpone to the last moment the beginning of the League.
Dennis Quaid replies indignantly
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now has trouble with the ex: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan has declared adulterer his ex Dennis Quaid.
He foams with anger and replies.
The War of the Roses has been delayed for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now fighting with each other in a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time commented on the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayal she would have known only after the separation.
The occasion for the "striptease of the soul" was the work with the press of Ryan for his new film "The Women" – it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his being publicly declared an adulterous husband was of clear shock: it would be “unheard of,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that “Meg for the umpteenth time repeats and reworks the history of our relationship.”
It would also be "deplorable" for Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, to again "be publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since her separation, Quaid is remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
And so his judgments end with the arrow: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family where everything goes well."
Lower prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and hotel overnight stays have become more affordable again - this is the result of a study of the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of the year 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter it observed a noticeable decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already dropped in price.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed still rise on average around 6.9 compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees this as a reason for the weak dollar price, which would have led to a "hot desire to travel of American tourists"
Financial centers such as Frankfurt and London would also be hit harder by the recession in hotel prices than industrial centers such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices the trend in the first quarter still marks upwards:
Due to the increased cost of kerosene, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, airfare prices in Economy Class decreased by an average of 12.5 % compared to the previous quarter, but price changes in First Class and Business were much weaker.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9 %, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 %.
As for German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price collapse would be on the one hand the downward economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, because of the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, there would be an increased pressure on competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that would have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
At Borussia Luhukay still can’t find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the lucky landing for the national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first entered the game late and failed with a shot on the crossbar
His message was formulated with precision, it passed on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right
“We need the second goal,” said Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg Arena booths.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game break was over, and most of them sat back in their seats.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for almost 3 decades, enjoying an even higher esteem than certain older players.
And so his warning was also heard in the upper echelons.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here's the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Not everything here was nice to see today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also "wanted to be more relaxed".
For the 1-0, the Hamburgers have to thank Mladen Petric for his header (11) and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
“It was a dirty win,” Martin Jol said.
The Hamburg SV will turn 121 this Monday.
The spectators celebrated already before, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports club as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We’re able to get everything right,” Marcell Jansen said.
He has a feeling, that the provisional table certificate is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilian Neves und Silva, the defender of the goal Petric as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more dribbling,” Jol said.
After the defeat of the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the bailout package’s failure have caused the Dow Jones to temporarily collapse by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in one-day space in its history.
Later the Down picked up a little bit again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock market barometer quoted/recognized with a good 5% gap on 10,579 payors.
The Nasdaq tech stock exchange stood still with a deficit of more than 7% out of 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which dropped just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do that.
Goldman Sachs shares fell by just 10 percent.
Only a few days before, the great investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
As part of the bailout, financial funds were to be allocated for the grabbing of so-called mortgage documents.
The sum must be paid, however, not in one stroke, but in degrees.
In turn, the state had to maintain the Aktienoptionsscheine of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate trend in the prices, to reduce the charge on the state coffers.
The course of stocks in Europe and the USA in the swirl of the downturn
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the US does not erase the doubts of investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate plummets and tears the index of the German stock exchange down
The American Dow Jones Index recovers despite the planned bailout of the financial market through the state.
Spectacular loss of the price of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pulled the German stock market index into deep deficit.
The shares of the Munich real estate lender lost despite the bailout action of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank sold more than 20%.
The index of the German stock exchange DAX slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is quoted with a deficit of 3.7% on 5,839 points.
Global stock markets are falling to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a deficit.
Investors feared the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost in the first hour of business 334 points or 3.3% on 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate could follow the first of October.
The other European stock exchanges could only have one direction: in London for the moment the FTSE index fell by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Nikkei benchmark after initial profits fell 1.26% out of 11,743.61 payers.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1% to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex bottom index lost 506.33 points or 3.9% and closed with 12,595.75 payers.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for nearly 18 years.
Due to the fuel pipes freezing in a hurry, death from freezing now rests on her.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of the Swing-by
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/push/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example from Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical device as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has amazed scholars for years: rockets do not behave quite as one would expect under the law of gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the anomaly of the swing-by.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton firmly believes as before Einstein was wrong, and attempts to explain the anomaly of the swing-by by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
"A person responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about 10 years.
From her comes evidently a force of attraction, the effect of which on the other celestial bodies is shown.
Instead, she herself is completely invisible, that is, she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter makes up at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a pre-release shootout, six kidnappers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
The negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported in agreement by the Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health,” Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The backstage of a shooting that took place before the release of the hostages remains unclear: therefore the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It would have been “only a matter of taking the hostages,” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
Sudanese soldiers Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot dead 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million from Germany; the money should have been handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women as hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men should have been held until the kidnappers had a safe escape.
The German embassy in Cairo rejected a statement on the report.
The abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led to a woman killing herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for six years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confession note, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise would harass and bandage her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Ms. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle’s friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, had “emotionally died,” and that she had “quit with life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I bound her and bandaged her."
“I didn’t sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when you were only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn’t, it would have been difficult for the facts to end up in court.”
I notice the effects Stephanie’s father and mother describe having had on their daughter over the years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy young woman of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The man was on a trip from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges made under this law, and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
“They may have thought this was being dealt with internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer must be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The lost documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the account of B&B
British construction companies could face an account of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the bailout of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) general manager Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” that companies and their members had to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when the Bradford & Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies between them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the association of construction companies, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
“It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovering home market are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account,” Cole said.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk rises to 5 pennies per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five penny per liter by Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to offload the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many corruption charges hanging against you.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is expected in the coming weeks but her party, the Awami League, has called for the country’s military-backed temporary government to give her complete freedom first.
The correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical care on parole, it is unclear according to the terms of her release, whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he'll appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order.
“The high court rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina on the grounds that she cannot have bail since she is already abroad on parole for medical care,” says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the High Court's order."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan Polio Campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The U.N. carried out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesperson said this was despite Taliban promises that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying the vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission’s decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB has been told by the competition’s appeals court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's stake in ITV sowed doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New Investigation into U.S. Attorney's Case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was sparked by fears that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Serious allegations concerning potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or ascertained,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been rated poorer than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the lawsuit against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and pursue lawsuits in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in a storm of dismissals, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials fired.
(The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in dismissals, that he had abdicated his role as a leader and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including former senior Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold award at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honored" to earn the award.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of the 1977 Meat Loaf album hit.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year’s awards, being on the nominee list in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of them."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number 15.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album remained on the charts for almost nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossroads, some famous, others merely of use.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give the Extra Place location, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy road.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road, however, must have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the newly built luxury buildings on First Road.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include long-time neighbors who say they were struck by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the stately quarter of the past.
But the city’s preservation and development department, which has control of the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the land use committee of the district municipal commission some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has called for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
“There is very little space left to the city’s property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” he said.
“There could be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access.”
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it wanted to reopen the small road and install seating, including some to use for a café to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main concern is to renovate this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity,” he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation Housing, said it was the city’s desire to sell the road and pointed out that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous sons and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The ground was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, scraps of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about "gentrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the publicly owned piece, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of almost unchanged city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A somewhat nostalgic look at the endangered city"), published part of a speech on the history of the city that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote, "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark even in the daytime and delimited rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, with week-old newspapers floating along the slums."
With a few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat swiftly ran through the back of the street near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and a 22-ounce bottle of empty beer lay next to a group of freshly abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that it would need to be a little embellished.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life," she said, "were in black, dirty, disgusting places."
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California Studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School.”
Really attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving goals, Obama’s educational plan specifically supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English learners.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom teaching of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The school’s students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, an astonishing 100 percent of students took the upper-level test in the 2008 state math exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth graders took the expert-level test on art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient from Mr. Obama’s favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes reviewing and exercising, constant assessment of skills, and a “no apology” attitude.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s obstructive approach to English learners is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you wouldn't have been able to pinpoint what it was."
"It works," he noted, "for us it works."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Spanish-majority schools with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent it from predicting Mr. Obama’s answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the argument trivial when he said people should stop worrying about “English-only” legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to make sure your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps in achievement, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than scorning or trivializing them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the U.S. bailout for financial markets may fail to lift the economy.
Crude oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Stock Exchange in the morning trades.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial turmoil on Wall Street, and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plummeted to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before rising again amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety affected investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the weekend’s frantic trades had led to a bailout “appear to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a statement to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape contagion.
From a raw materials perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Banking analysts lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, lowering oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time in the Jets uniform than anyone in the past eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the grayness of the threatening clouds that loomed over them with a weak game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tuning took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the passages that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people may think."
While Favre and Coles played catch games, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hard.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a rogue pitch and re-raised it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went ahead of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had the ball back with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, with a 34-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe his madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets conceded 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Gebrselassie rested breaks his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathoner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile run under the 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory over the flat run in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous score of 2:03:26, running last year in Berlin, for 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for such a stunning career that he has produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing — perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect — that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-backers like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went long distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had calf cramps and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well.”
He has been somewhat criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival – for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, relying on opener as if it were a mid-range race, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie’s skills as a marathoner.
With four Kenyans pacing on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in competition after the track openers vanished.
A little over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made an uphill final to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but she healed to win in Berlin, making her personal best time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a large detachment, picking them up after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Tucked away in the expansive theme park on the outskirts of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the enormous, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come into life.
Eatonville, the first all-black incorporated city in the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city he described – and which makes tourists stop by including it in the Florida tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project – remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that “knowing so little about us, he doesn’t know what he’s missing.”
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called in for an opening speech on race, many here remain suspicious of the outsider’s gaze.
“We’re very cautious about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power grab and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes disdained, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really began with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just outside Rout 17, a road that runs through often-forgotten central Florida into a backdrop of black history and human drama.
Low as a crate in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the street on the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with the white trim, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always cared about, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits the passing rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously this was not Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
“Zora used to say it the way it was,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson’s girls Hurston immortalizes by quoting men singing rude songs about their beauty.
He adds, “Some people don’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family and moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that when Hurston plunged into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts decent clothing today.
Many of the inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others grinned.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, swinging on his back patio chair overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no great conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando’s expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 through the city’s western boundary.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had brought an end to its idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community's doorstep.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting on the side," says Mr. Franklin.
“We actually had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race".
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville’s cohesion and jeopardizes the confidence of its young people.
“Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember this — you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there's a cultural division there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and made room for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the unmarked tomb of Hurston and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit the shelves of bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had turned the spotlight again.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its street project.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd puts it simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image that the city has of itself.
Those from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new single-storey bookstore (named Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a side road in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to search for the Eatonville story, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permission request in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things - such as the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, which show black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a chubby teacher, with a penchant for bright red, still fears that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of city pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, troubled, and everything, no better, no worse and proud, creative, hardworking, silly and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who he said may need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“A lot of people, if they’ve just come in here, will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” said Alondra Kenon after Mass on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a pretty city.”
Here in New York we all speak fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens of Times Square, they would not notice that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, honeycombed over their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City are living their worst “bad office day” every day since the 1929 collapse.
The deliverymen shake metal trolleys for tea through the sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 broken ironed shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagels at food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to catch a yellow taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on a working day.
It didn’t seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings book on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had planned the affair to coincide with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "banker of trust", were in line for the same reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from commuter locations such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit unions, and types of city savings banks whose branches only operate within a state, and they say they treat customers like family members.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been submitted to the controlled administration, and while New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The clerks and clerks who stood in front of me, frightened by another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is demanding more bonds from Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become proficient in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank gone bankrupt, and its emaciated general manager Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the concierge in uniform, almost fifty years old from my condominium, has changed the subject from our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim tombs desecrated while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the right-wing Belgian party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry road signs like those representing mosques with a red line passing in the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties won a lot in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The culprits spray-traced Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some tombs, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motives driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with strongly anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be connected to Islam.
At the final gathering in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analysis made immediately after the election, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Banned overseas trip to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamour rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The ban on foreign travel was granted to Kent police last Thursday after they provided evidence to magistrates of Glitter’s previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at the prosecution of Ashford in Kent but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A Court Service spokesperson said: “On Thursday, September 25 at the Ashford Prosecutor’s Office, Kent Police filed an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travel abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the register of convicted sex offenders.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police a seven-day notice of his planned departure date.
Failure to notify the authorities can lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or possible movements of Glitter in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have suitable complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of the Kent Police and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of convicted sex offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter came he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities would not pass him through passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to let him in and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Prosecutor's Office, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to include him in the register of convicted sex offenders.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
An Interior Ministry source said Interior Secretary Jacqui Smith felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character." -Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no steering wheels, no old-fashioned dresses.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser-known side of these masters.
With this lens, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, increasing every day," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the road" are "artists who can convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these great it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with my camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With a passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not the dance, the singing or the playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraiture led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment into their lives, whether this is a long or a short moment.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters you sometimes don’t even know or who give you only a few minutes to take the photo.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concretize my ideas.”
The collection of contemporary flamenco portraits, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at number 20 of via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "hazard"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always a favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I would not write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by attendees – an ancient edition of Dickens’ book “Our mutual friend,” filled the seats at the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to which memory has flown the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, has evoked how he was born in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as the "discipline" to write in
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "it makes people more nonconformist" and "invites" them to write.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of races
The celebration of the races that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the races had verified that the soil conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, has decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The weather raged against this Festival preventing it from celebrating two out of three days.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second bullfight from taking place.
On the billboard were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who would face a bull of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having bullfighted with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races collecting greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing by the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, he earned the whistles of much of the audience.

Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents, after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years of age, identified as A. A. J., according to the statement of the Interior Department of the Basque government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The accident occurred when some Alava road officials were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, violating orders, abruptly accelerated and passed the checkpoint.
The officers chased until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants fled to a wooded area.
Ertzaintza agents were then able to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note once they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish pans, which were located in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for in-depth investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since officials have ascertained that the registration number had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with that reported in the van's documentation, the arrestee was also charged with the crime of falsification of public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the source of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee A. A. J. was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get her car out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to a spokesperson for the Californian highway.
The witness specified that around 4.30pm the Locklear "crashed the accelerator deep, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with abrupt forward and backward maneuvers. Reversely, she passed several times in front of her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first glance apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that the Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and had exited the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused," and for this reason the officers took her to a specialist center for drug and alcohol use to test her.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress has proved to be collaborative and the hypothesis of excessive alcohol was dismissed from the outset, although "according to what officers observed at first, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from a specialty clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the IU and member of the United Left party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of training to take a decision on the case of the former councilor for Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has been until now an assessor in the Seville council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigations to have maximum transparency."
He also stressed that training is governed by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Sangre de mayo", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Episodes Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci proposes in Sangre de mayo the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of interpreters.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in theaters, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before shooting a film commemorating the second centenary of the 2nd of May in Madrid. The director had accepted on condition that the story was based on the novel Episodios Nacional.
The 15 million budgets allocated in full by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray "a stunned Spain that misplaced the choice of the leader for whom to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought to the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" remarked Garci.
However, the director regrets that he has not received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the set design that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual work practice, staging with actors, with whom he often uses to try before filming alongside those who will not be in the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to the theater and to the cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the performers, part of whom are cast in Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at this year's Hollywood Academy - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos - represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
From this movie Garci does not expect prizes.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and at some point you just settle for shooting one more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer pays homage to another dancer equally from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with the family to London.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, which marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. I thought it was incredible."
The dancer says: "We do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the serpent" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic,” she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of her shows, as she does in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who had been her student.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I’m happy because he agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about that.”
The set-up also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have always been spa-loves, and in everything.
In some form, the life of this woman is also present, taking place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her, because I think she is one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her and even less considers her work as something of value,” says Bayon.
The show will begin today, at 8.30 pm at Lope de Vega’s theatre.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeta recién casado" the Triennium also ends
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Department of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the death of the Nobel Prize.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel house-museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after having touched the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York with the International Congress.
In addition, the Department of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
I like America a little less without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
It cost him a lot to win an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
It was also known that he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better because of his existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark time, for fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on the ground, desperate for new reasons to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and there are still people to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone it embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and advocated for lost and won cases, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of the overdose-dead firstborn to the creation of the home and organic food brand.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, regardless of nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not a man died, it was an epoch.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He left a very high-level example for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who tries to live today as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for rectitude and to have a serious private life and away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman sets a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful although he certainly did not miss the opportunities to not be.
"Why am I going out to eat hamburgers today, if I have a steak in the house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles she played, no one was as proud as a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and passionate philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever witnessed.
A lot of nonsense, which if it were taken into account later in the evaluation and I had to examine it, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the bib, which was supposed to go earlier.
It didn’t seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, let it be to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, you don't.
You had to go only to get the back (first nonsense, go only for that) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they only had t-shirts of size 'S' (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things of this kind are inepties compared to the day of the race itself.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected by more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started that we had not even yet deposited the backpack, although, once successful in the undertaking, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion and assault on the stand were added.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the ranking in the correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, did not correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it will certainly not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft looking for receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft previewed a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move inside the company's campus) assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this “receptionist” is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are – including remembering their position in the company – and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group people into conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group she is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be available shortly.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week there has been a lot of talk about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for “the least”.
A whole discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continually added to Windows features and "extras".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is losing more and more importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the web, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
We take the computer only to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and daily we spend more time surfing the web than in a remote windowed environment.
What are half of the operating system applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a viable alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I give a small example here.
I took the photo in this post at one of Microsoft’s employee recreational facilities in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soda machine a sign urges them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to perform a search on the network.
Last week, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be released in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it to the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and was part of the uniform typical of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can evoke the image of the forcible with the pointed mustache that lifts the weights in the traveling circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's t-shirt, with a cotton interior, tight and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out among all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the t-shirt wear as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels over the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not only about the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor t-shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Underwear designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't bother me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the signature Mango has made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and timid, it conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let’s say, a very busy day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to get lost in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it frequently.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, although in the end, everything comes together and there are many elements in common.
Since I was a child, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to search my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to the dress.
It is known that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and to the sages, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they hand you the wardrobe is the moment you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into a crisis?
No, I'm not.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted since I was a little girl and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're going to be a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me to and also I want to be a young mother, this I do not want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don’t worry too much.
What I will do will be to give my son a lot of happiness and to educate him with a lot of love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you are waiting for some films shot last year to come out in different theaters.
That's right, and I really want them out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can not always be so.
I want "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ" to come out.
Let's see if you like them.
A few days ago you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the catwalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, who I’ve known for a long time, called me to invite me to London to participate in a charity show for her organization “Women for a Better World” and the clothes we exhibited – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that I, who have known her for a long time, can confirm that they are not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to do the pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help third world women, you can't back down.
Recurring drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcocock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive alcohol in the blood, install in his car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of drunkenness or if you do not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The aim of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since he will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving while intoxicated then return to drive the car.
The alcoholock would avoid this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol than allowed is detected.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce up to 65% of infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to put a stop to these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, doubtless, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, according to schedule, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar at the airport Benito Juárez in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays were still forcing them to use their hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that time ... You're from here or ...
- No, no sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the princes of Asturias are and the importance of travel.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 soldiers of the navy who offer the greeting of honor.
The prince looks smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, windy-haired, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps she was told that Mexico City threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing through the hall where the official entourage awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a funny Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award, than Paris, and there is probably no more exquisite and bont-vive designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to encourage the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango shop window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried out of emotion.
It is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just opened at 1,335 square metres.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who chaired the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal’s most exquisite canvases, Mango’s gala presidential table was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making virtue of necessity, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a House dress and some complements of ELAH to take his breath away and to the arm of his son Luis - a boy of almost two meters in height - he accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the homage dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of home and as a knight as he finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirt – designed by her own hand – transformed herself for dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and was thrilled during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the room for the ballet essays and she, remembering other times, “grabbed a bar and swallowed it”.
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the building, but she had shown us before the photos of her son on the mobile phone.
The next day we rejoiced in the presence of Olivier Martinez – another big guy who moves on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously made sure that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation in the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7am, but it’s even worse to imagine yourself caught up in the hectic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or even two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the difficulty of breaking away from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga poses, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole "menu" of options tailored to each person's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is called "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone feels that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "handbook" denies this belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline is not already flowing through your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who talk while staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you get a scare, but it doesn’t really matter much.
It is a benign sleep disturbance called somnilochia.
It occurs with some frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you spoke in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nighttime fears, nighttime enuresis (peeing in bed), or sleepwalking, but it is not necessarily so.
As already mentioned above it can be associated with stages of very high fever, situations of stress or overexcitation.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (screams, screams, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet to the situation.
We have said that this is a benign disorder so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress situation).
What you can do, on the other hand, is take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to overexcite the child before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiring to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will allow the baby to sleep more peacefully.
Once the sleep apneas appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he is speaking, he is sleeping and therefore he is resting.
Remember that if it appears very distressed and the episodes have a certain frequency it is best to consult a doctor or check where such a great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he says (which isn’t the most common situation), don’t be tempted to interrogate him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what it says but not to see what it is dreaming about to say it, so you have to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it could lead.
Never tell the child that you might ask him questions at night to learn his secrets.
Not even a joke.
Such a thing causes enormous anguish.
In short, do not worry, it is nothing serious, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern has finally found the way to victory at home after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Blacks created the most net chances, turning one into the victory of the game.
The pace was not very fast during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves with difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the home team Kauffmann who touched the seven with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirn alto, Romain of point and again Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a midfield block, leaving only the unleashed Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first goal of Marais for Illhaeusern, well positioned, resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern gunner will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause great problems to the Eleven of Illhaeusern, just backed up to "strengthen" the defense, except in the very last minutes of play when, after a rocambolesque action, the ball touched the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
Before the demonstration of the fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to enchant its representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "he will come forward with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel, which reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president will “discuss with them about possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to make safe working conditions and the remuneration of sailors”.
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon peninsula, a roadblock has been implemented.
On Monday, the sailors already showed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, as demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to ports along the Atlantic and English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where the fishing vessels remained at the pier, or to Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of trade vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe et du Croisic, near the Loire-Atlantique, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the well-known Total refinery of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting that will be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give in" and "they do not intend to move to Paris," announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay diesel taxes, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is only reached with a diesel of less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and again Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts for 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite recession threats to the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest airline, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, particularly for aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, re-established by the U.S. monetary authorities, would sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the loan of $85 billion, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to consider selling much of its assets, as well as selling its life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the paper said on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestitures, according to the FT.
There was no confirmation at the AIG.
The assets AIG plans to divest include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on such transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the U.S. authorities take over 80% of its capital.
Paris: history Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange plunged into a historic slump on Monday after the House of Representatives voted against Paulson's bailout of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, an unprecedented drop to close to 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) exceeded that of September 17, 2001, the day of the reopening of the stock exchanges following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
The Nasdaq, the index of major technology stocks, lost 199.61 points to close at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to close at 1,106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the start of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favor, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
“It’s a negative signal to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this signals how much the market relied on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
“If the project were actually dying...then it would be quickly passed on to the Fed and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And further highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, the Piegza stressed.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities have arranged for the purchase of Wachovia’s banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging urgent intervention for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis," added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on 10-year Treasury Notes fell to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, while the 30-year yield was 4.161%, compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama in the lead in the first TV duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American households.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, while deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which an opinion poll published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat has won.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% point to McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama’s lead on Thursday.
“Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his undisputed foreign policy expertise, underlining the "naivety" of the opponent regarding the topics addressed during the first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that.” he has often stated on multiple occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and the skills to be president,” he said.
What has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without protracting, it has proved concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama," a Democratic ad said this weekend, accusing the Republican of failing to take the necessary measures to address the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under heavy rain, for an election meeting.
He did not even utter the words “middle class” or “workers.” The financial crisis is in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the verge of a precipice.
“Next week could be a turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s intuition on economic issues to Clinton’s intuition during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse “is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming his intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the upheavals of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, meanwhile, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates dodged questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Didn't you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While they were still waiting for the results, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confess that they haven’t even voted: “What for? They’ll do whatever they want with my vote,” says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made good appearances before foreign observers with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian officials and asset freezes, could be lifted if these elections are considered legitimate by observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the counting of votes," said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a change of front," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the ballots and in this case is the executive.
If opposition MPs enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings and bills.”
The opposition therefore has the duty to enter the political game because "it is necessary to start the dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not undertake any reforms, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the election process will recognize the validity of the vote.
He stresses that participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has given rise to all kinds of manipulation.
"Didn't you notice that there were elections?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polls.
And there will have been a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the most convenient ones in power."
The night silence falls on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are delighted with their success.
The meeting - The blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
Above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the infected blood scandal in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such a tragedy and protests from the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was delaying in drafting a report, some provinces set up a committee with the goal of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its operations, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, says Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and to field research over the following years, we have regained the public’s trust,” she explains before proudly stating that by the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Québec now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, she tells who has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when you have doubts and could result in a serious disease, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, you take measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that without any doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests that allow the presence of the virus in the blood of donors to be recognized directly, rather than antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, that is, from the moment the person contracted the disease to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not being able to detect them has thus greatly decreased.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, that means you’ll need to distribute 12 million blood samples before anyone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted by transfusion is found.
I believe that today one can feel reassured in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the direction of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
We need to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before emphasizing that in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also provide enough.
“The needs are increasing as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences on the number of donors, which on average constitutes only 3% of Quebecers who are acceptable as donors.
However, all healthy people who are 18 years of age and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is widespread, they will be rejected for a period equal to one year.
“With this 3%, we can maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortage are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this donor group as they get older and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that it is hardly an hour to donate blood,” says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, the Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Héma-Québec, which operates the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is plenty of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated a few weeks ago the bank entry of our 1,000th sample of cord blood and plan to take more than 1,000 each year.
We should start proposing them for transplants early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of cord blood collection as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't access it", as Héma-Québec doesn't have the necessary means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Impact Montreal qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A qualifiers, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday during a second decisive match of the quarter-finals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first half without goals on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
In the first game of the return leg on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 first in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed later in the day.
In brief - Decisive network of Kovalev
The Canadiens and their aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, made two passes, and collected a pass for the victory, in the fourth of the preparatory games of the Hab.
The only goal signed by Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
“I’m not ready yet,” warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to overdo it in the first half,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation.”
Charest Points to the North
The prime minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
After the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to get elected on the occasion of today's by-elections.
"Extending the borders of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of tools with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "image mill".
On three maxi screens, spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the prime minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labor, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the prime minister’s most recent speeches, the opening of the North – the northern territory to the 49th parallel – had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel with immense potential", but did not comment on timing or investment quotas, nor did he explain what the precise priorities will be in the realization of future projects.
At the very most, he has confined himself to pointing out what he believes deserves a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure has experienced several improvements.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
That "territory twice as big as France" is here, it's Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is intrinsic to us," he insisted, as if to urge a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government,” he said.
"Considering climate change, we need to reassess the North," he said of the Northwest Passage, which will be open all year round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.”
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to this and that the project would serve their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the PQ of Ungava), have already started the consultation of about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a time when "common visions will be provided."
The development of the North would, moreover, abide by the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “concerted, ordered and will respect the environment,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to stand out to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was, moreover, one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Station into the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to shape the future,” Charest said.
During the press conference, he resorted to another reference, conservative this time, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest stated that its commissioning would be scheduled for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we will make it," he told his supporters, sparking applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who in April claimed there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very busy, particularly on a federal council mission to China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that passed smooth as oil: the PLQ demands above all the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the draft of the Northern Plan has been met with skepticism.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, dusted off the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had, "we would have made progress today," Marois said alongside Jean-Talon's candidate, Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
"What we hope is that this is not simply perceived as a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, returning from the holidays today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former minister of "justice" (ironical fate) of the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the entourage of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one of all the Western countries involved that has not repatriated a citizen of its own detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We would like to remind you that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are calling for the return of Omar Khadra so that he can be tried in Canada.
It is precisely that same government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
He doesn't realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy," a word that Harper keeps flaunting and that sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we are at a time when there is no longer any morality: you can arbitrarily mistreat, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until now a minority (to see what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
This is where the shame lies, Mr. Toews, in renouncing all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small, squatter publishing house with the intention of initiating a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a defamation lawsuit, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the writers and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend a substantial sum of money in order to organize their defense and fight, with decidedly uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers financed from the practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these unequal arms struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual settlement that muzzles the opposition as well as frightens anyone who dares to rule again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public that it would have to present its own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates are usually held with the exchange of opinions and not with batons.
It would therefore have been enough for society to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in the public opinion and badly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Canada Nero.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same public is quite evident?
In the vice president's world, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the well-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Canada Nero does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not from the perspective of what many perceive as a kind of gagging (in search of the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Black an ultimatum instructing them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver’s surreal discourse, the Barrack Gold complaint constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies in block the right to cite authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are inconvenient to the richest companies in the world, if there are multiple lawsuits, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards as the authors of Canada Nero do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it is not seeking a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the university world, as is the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to curb abusive lawsuits.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street - Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic side, yesterday finally reached an agreement on the largest savings plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to curb the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses forfeited for non-payment, as well as a right of inspection on the salaries paid to the managers of the protected companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Rep. Judd Gregg at the negotiating table announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market deal," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the American economy and people from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
"It's the crux of the matter: If we hadn't acted in this way, inestimable discomfort and disturbance would have poured into the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The time limit agreed corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates for the US presidential election, who later joined the negotiations, were rather in favour of the agreement, but did not avoid expressing their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with having added some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow owners to maintain their domicile and the one related to salaries for executives of companies covered by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he said on the U.S. television screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he would vote for the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
“From what I’ve read, it’s something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to repurchase with taxpayer money the dubious, at-risk and non-sale assets of U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a housing bubble that led first to the collapse of mortgages at risk (hypothecs) , and then extend to other more widespread forms of debt securities (PCAA) and result in the freezing of liquidity and the dislocation of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of incumbent Republicans who blew up the first draft of a deal last week.
It seems to have come out of that dead end since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" assets of some struggling companies are only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone, Congress has added a provision that if the government were to face losses over the next five years due to such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of $250 billion, to which another $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The $350 billion payment is expected to be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will obtain shares in the companies protected that will earn dividends in the event of profit and that it can resell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay foreclosure proceedings relating to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and severance payouts paid to the managers of the companies involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the go-ahead.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both on the Republican and Democratic sides.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," House Finance Committee member Scott Garrett told his constituents.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Not to take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed the “skeptic’s caucus,” Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say, ‘We ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way forward,’” he said.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the test of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) to the crisis of mortgages at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of Europe’s 20 largest banks and 10 largest insurers.
“It’s not money lost,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, they collect influence and the right to vote in banking matters.
It’s certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are announcing uncertain.”
During this period, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seems to be nationalising another bank in the throes of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the loans currently underway at the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion (US $ 75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Blue-eyed beauty was for a long time her ace in her sleeve, for others her weak spot.
Had he got rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the enchanting smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
What a constancy.
Paul Newman, who passed away Friday at the age of 83 on his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in recent years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his play, certainly more fragile, but also a spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often have magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because he recognized a whole country infatuated with the safe made man, the war fighter of the Pacific, proud in combat, who in the early 50s studied dramatic art at Yale, he subsequently attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the race car driver who finished second at the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as a sex symbol, though part of a 1958 model couple with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him go the shadows of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to the scandals of show business, whose mystery will never be completely unraveled.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s passing this weekend has been a heartbreak for moviegoers as his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through his interpretations.
Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy (1969) and that boy unable to desire his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) are confused in memory in The Hot Cat on the Roof, adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what he promised.
Many more Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Up There Someone Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's 1961 film The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him the only Oscar in 1987 out of nine nominations.
That face through the years, it was hers.
He's back.
Epochs follow each other through his path.
Young people know him best from the cult movie Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, by the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with a last role as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Era mi padre, in 2003.
Unlike film legends who soon abandoned the trade, Newman will remain in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its splendor, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French amateur filmmaker, called it, with a hint of irony, "a living challenge to underplay", judging his performances exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, drunken alcoholics or desperate, of which he expressed mischief and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pure sensitivity.
Jennifer's 1968 first appearance (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle female portrayal of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated in 1984 the film Harry and Son, discreet and sad.
Among the countless tributes that rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old partner Robert Redford (they had starred together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated with infinite sadness, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the deceased actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the Hollywood drift, is thus extinguished.
We will have seen her face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging it a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
The proceeds from those sales were, however, earmarked for his Struggling Children's Foundation.
Newman, instead of resting on his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
To be there was a privilege.”
And just as privileged was it for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & partners?
The hearing of the criminal trial against János Zuschlag et al. will be held shortly on 8 October.
The politician and his associates are charged with repeated commercial fraud committed within the framework of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from calls for tenders was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the carrying out of the activities by means of false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million florins, ended up partly in the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method disclosed by the investigating authorities, they have withdrawn the money obtained from calls for tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the blocks of invoices were purchased at the market in Józsefváros, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which firms to issue invoices, it was established among other things during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for consumption, on the model of these then invoices were prepared to be forwarded to the competition notices, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, mainly prepared the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of the "study trip" of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag et al. in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurant, would not all enter the restaurant together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later called Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, is full of formal and content errors.
A pension of Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however on the invoice there were 130 guests.
But the compilers of the fanciful invoices exaggerated when they reported Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, in whose accounting - according to the information released to the judicial authorities - did not even appear the documents in the name of the companies Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, a director of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecution and the invoices were shown to him, he immediately realized that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and VAT number of our company were in the wrong place."
He added: besides the formal reasons, there was also no return to the fact that according to the invoice, 100 people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
In addition, the bill was for catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for some time.
The assiduous invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash payment trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing invoices of the company.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, the invoice also included VAT, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favor of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company you have to apply the VAT at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition the employees of the hotel only issued printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured by hand was written.
In addition to this, the "issuers" ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as is known from the procedure of the Prosecutor, activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition for formal defects - due to non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it was found that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Field, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there, which is why, according to our information, the liquidator of the company denied that he had issued that invoice.
They consciously issued invoices.
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue dummy invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and members Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million florins to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület, behind which there was no real economic activity.
No movement of money because the invoices prepared were then reversed, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those who can be connected with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to the contact of the general manager of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with the trade of fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer equipment, for a value of approximately 18 million guilders.
According to the data of the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, under liquidation since 14 September 2005, purchased these invoices.
The general manager of this company was a Romanian to whom between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov submitted the documents concerning the company.
As far as we know, during the investigation, Kubatov acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, the companies were useful to him because at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the founding documents of the companies, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: to Atlasz and to Y-Generáció.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecution believes that Kubatov pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont tender notice.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a notice for the Socialist Party's public utility Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the notice.
To prevent this from coming to light, they submitted five dummy invoices received from Works Team Kft to TMA.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a part of the defendants, as they have already done by proxy, will probably report on the progress of the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing might be if the defendant number one, János Zuschlag, decided to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
We have to see if it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made arrangements with Zusi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Mr Zuschlag could also have been offended for now, as his demands for the relief of his conditions of imprisonment, i.e. the granting of house arrest, have not been met so far.
While the perpetrators of commercial crimes not compensable and causing much greater damages can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The Psychology of Excess Bidding: Why Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers are likely to spend more, to overvalue the goods.
Neuroscientists and economists at New York University have managed to uncover the neuro-economic underpinnings of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, men do not want to be left behind in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this “game” at the nervous system level through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex enters intensively into operation when you lose to the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price increase is explained by avoiding the vehement reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the research team's economists conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this investigation, three groups tendered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported what the real value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they have promised that in the case of winning they will receive another prize of $ 15.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost the money in case of loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
By checking the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the group that played "against loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control or "winner" group.
“These results are not deducible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, until now they explained the phenomena found at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we came up with a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor in the School of Economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when to go to the doctor?
Nearly half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death in Hungary.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For those who travel it is useful to vaccinate against the virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots form on the skin and white of the eyes, stools become light and urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
A million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most severe variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive a drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancers.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because the pathogens subtly destroy the liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
In the world today, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease, it is worth consulting the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus ceases the infectious power and can be prevented the formation of tumors.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 worldwide by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent survey, the religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have carried out an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the sensation of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the rather bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out on 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while all were observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploration technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling pain.
The test is the first in a series of researches in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University take part.
The test took place exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the Hermelin by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a reassuring effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time frame they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care" of them and "they calmed down and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image, they realized 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but you have to find the right image.
“We have to look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, like a mother or a father,” he said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality," Wright added.
After the excellent results remains only the question whether the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the 10th birthday, Google can claim to be in people’s pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which clinic they go to and what interests them.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s directors, is not yet enough.
As for the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they don’t really see the substance of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose is to collect as much personal data of its users as possible and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google’s founders that was: “we put all the information of the world into one system!”
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
Asked what will happen five years from now, Schmidt said: “Would he like Google to answer questions like ‘what do I do tomorrow?’ or ‘what would be the right job for me?’ but software doesn’t know how to answer seemingly simple questions because it doesn’t know enough about users.”
Not all Internet users are aware that during their searches on the Internet exactly the words searched are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago users can e.g. memorize their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these then in the long run will generate much better tailor-made results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - users worried about Google's data monopoly ask.
In most cases the counter-reactions of Internet users are provoked by the fear felt for the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not for the guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire for freedom or even for the rebellion to power.
However, one fact is confirmed, namely that all the searched expressions are not only recorded but in reasoned cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times has been the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights, on the other hand, sighed of relief in May when the company – in agreement with the EFF e-legal protection association – successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even then you can not force Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully ripped out nearly 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to get individual users’ search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who are afraid to provide their personal data scourge Google because they believe that in this way their intimate sphere and private life is affected by starting to use its services and they rise with the rebellion due to the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users appearing in numerous countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is kept up-to-date and the package of programs is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies one of the most repeated keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, about intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all of these can be placed in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which automatically appear his most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or on Picasa.
Meanwhile we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the joint tour of friends, easily comes to know who spent the night with her perfidious boyfriend or a company can fire an employee because he wrote a sincere opinion on the company's top: one thing is for sure, the concept of private life has now completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid the monopoly of Google can do so (beginning for example with Scroogle using the Google search system but at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are many people who do not register on community pages to not be found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far existing.
The public does not even secretly wait for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars in value is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time instead cause great discomfort not only to Microsoft but also to numerous companies of software development.
However, the critical observers next to all this find alarming points: the company top for example has totally rejected the protest of employees after having doubled the rate of corporate asylum, has considered too expensive the repeated daily catering of employees, but all this diminishes the fact that in 2006 Google has bowed the head to the Chinese government and in accordance with their agreement will offer all the good results.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is sure, however, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world in one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving of books and magazines of Google will assume such proportions that the company will soon find itself in front of the US Supreme Court Health system, others are afraid.
The fact that Google is building a genetic data base can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the story Scroogled by the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped the double killer of <0xC3><0x93>zd to make the traces disappear
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, suspected to have helped disappear the traces of the crime, said Tuesday the spokesman of the Police Station of the Borsod region.
The young men have admitted the crime to them, they are currently accused of aiding.
The two minors, two girls according to information from the MTI, defend themselves freely.
The aid is punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of multiple premeditated murder committed for profit.
The investigation found that the 23-year-old had a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, which is why last Wednesday he tricked his creditor into a construction site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
Police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million, or about CZK 5 billion, to buy 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange’s stock list.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of its shares within a few months.
The Czech financial daily E15 says the Polish supply represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by <0xC4><0x8C>eská Spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna Bank with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
Major European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster happened thanks to the American president, La Repubblica accuses, who was not able to compact his party behind a law bottled in a hurry, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbor, as billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11.
Even a part of the press in Madrid sees Washington as the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has pushed the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still offer a bailout donut to swaying financial institutions and with taxpayer money they can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse like a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new impromptu solutions will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the member states of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on dismembered financial markets.
Only Monday the weakened financial institutions have obtained more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which they seem increasingly real the anxieties that even European taxpayers, similar to those Americans, will have to use their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not cared much about the crisis that has crossed the old continent like a tsunami.
The "rescuers" must not immediately raise the 100 billion euros, however it would be better if they established in which case it is advisable to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damages.
The intelligent machine imitates the flight of the hornet
What could be the best method to develop anti-collision technologies if not to mimic obstacle sensors found in nature?
For example, those of bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the hornets gave the initial strategic cue to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mini-car with bee properties, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really looks a lot like our protective shield - explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technologies and research and development.
Important is the role of the view of the bee, capable of a view of 300 degrees in any direction.
The engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee's sight.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second, the robot senses the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels as necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, differently from the present system, takes place instinctively.
“If this were not the case, the car robot would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions,” says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Lab and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaged and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steerability of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to avoid the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a high energy density, which means that they last longer than lithium ion batteries.
According to Andoh it is important the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction, not the processing of the data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot has to process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuvering data, so it only uses a memory of a few tens of Kb.
You don’t need a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions, which, according to Nissan, can be installed on production vehicles within 10 years.
A further possibility of application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding obstacles on the road leads to the destination.

The written version of the $700 billion bailout law was drafted for the purchase of disproportionate credits, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the amount is spent.
In the new deal, which lasted until midnight on Saturday, the leaders of the congress decided on the $700 billion bailout after a debate that lasted for days, Reuters reported.
"We have made some serious progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, who said it was only a matter of putting the deal on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise plan.
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: the program will work and be effective, but there is still a lot to be done. According to Pelosi it is not about the bailout of Wall Street but the reversal of the economic chariot.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. Washington time (02 p.m. on Monday according to Central European time), but it did not bring a large growth of the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the bill called the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 concerning the program, after which it will fall to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, then welcomed the news of the deal to the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that the $700 billion would all be spent on buying the bonds with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now, as a first step, you can spend at most half of the sum of $700 billion, $250 billion immediately after the congressional vote on Monday, with these the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will be decided by the president.
A special college will oversee the program in which the president of the Federal Reserve also participates.
Spending the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can buy credits, mortgages and securities at the same time with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits.
The purchase can take place through auctions and in a direct way - they announced competent of the ministry.
The legal norm makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay a price appropriate to the probable damages.
Henrz Paulson said: The law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to be ready to introduce the newly signed law.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their exit, defined by the overseas slang simply as gold parachutes.
Payment limitations will only occur in some cases, furthermore the limitations depend on how the Treasury will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if they do not send the fallen bank manager to retirement.
At the time of direct purchase of the disproportionate loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not exaggerated.
To this it should be added that the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to incentivize participation in the program.
"This is the first case in American history of the coming into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of directors-general," said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn if the economy, and with it the bank rescued, will get back on its feet.
The bill includes that in the next five years the president must submit to Congress a proposal that provides for how to reimburse taxpayers for anticipated losses arising from the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
That’s not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes the measures were taken by the same people who are responsible for the Wall Street crash.

The prices of domestic industrial sales compared to the previous month increased only by 0.1%.
The prices of domestic sales of the processing sector also rose to a minimum extent, 0.1%, compared to July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoe processing sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and shoe production with a 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastics and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemicals and products sector.

In the other sectors of the processing industry there was a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the gas price increase effected by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the processing industry sectors, the largest increases were in the petroleum processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of metal products, prices rose by 13.2%, compared with 11% in the food, beverage and tobacco sectors, which accounted for a significant share.
Prices fell in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).

Next year in the US without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement may enter into force - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago with local Hungarian representatives.
In his opinion "now everything depends on the fact that the electronic entry and control system is built in time".
However, he drew attention to the fact that the new system will no longer allow entry, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue talks in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will deliver the Medal of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of the Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank bailout.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the government's $700 billion bailout of banks, but some politicians are calling for the Treasury minister's resignation.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they have concluded an agreement in principle on the bailout plan of the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to freeze the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be better suited than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the focus on economic issues, Obama has again recovered a bit of advantage, while McCain’s advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin as vice president, has dispersed.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps that he also supported.
"Now we have to act responsibly ... the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He hasn’t let go of calling McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
McCain said in an interview with ABC that “all of us will be pushing this situation down with difficulty ... but doing nothing is not a viable path.”
The Republican senator reported that the proposal includes the creation of a committee of control of the minister of finance and the limitation of the good exits of the top managers, things on which it was he who insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role to play in the deals, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-aware - so analyses Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the Red-Black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet edition of the German leftist magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution Devours its Parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-socialists have re-modernized Bavaria for decades and these modern citizens are now moving away from them.
The change of epoch is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so too of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005, still in the period of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The cause of this is the consequent modernization carried out in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists predicted this 40 years ago, but the time was very wrong, but secularization, educational achievements, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not be without consequences for the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities, and the political consequences are clear.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: the freelancers, the artisans, the graduates and the graduates.
Here, support for CSU fell below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Viennese conservative daily "Who with whom?" in the article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confusing internal Austrian political situation created following the elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> intends to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits SP<0xC3><0x96> from intervening in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
Elections have been made, now it revolves all around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast by public television the leaders of the parties have just shown the papers.
Werner Faymann, president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, has confirmed that he wants to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open thing in the party, issues should be discussed in any case within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, leader of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, repeated that he was open in all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Black coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility of governing," Haider said.
Jaróka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit for Equal Opportunities began today in Paris, organized this year by France with the rotating presidency of the European Union.
Livia Járóka, Fidesz deputy of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenary as the main speaker of the congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimír <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, European Commissioner responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz PE parliamentary group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, that Roma are being excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
"The majority of young Roma have no middle-level education and as a result of poor quality primary education only a trivial number of them can achieve a higher education degree."
Mr Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in enforcing human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the member states of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links among Roma and non-Roma in the broader context.
In fact, the sooner a Roma starts school, the greater their chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the nation’s budget.
"The right of Roma to European citizenship must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the deputy, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to speed up the processes of desegregation of schools and for this reason it is of fundamental importance to respect the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe" - asked Járóka.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year since last year's meeting in Berlin is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the ugly electoral defeat, the heads of the Bavarian CSU have not yet fallen, the discussion of personal issues has for the time being been postponed.
Party president Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein remain in their seats, the question is as long as mercy lasts.
Of the fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians made it known in any case that they were not attached with all their might to the chair.
So they tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" they demanded the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7%, but now, after the coup against Stoiber, it has fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of German GDP.
However, the conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy always count, and in the future they will be forced to form a coalition in any way.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir of Huber, gets a place in the small exploratory group that will start negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the free voters exponents of right-wing values for a possible coalition government in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity of coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat without regard the woman with great ambitions.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber, who has been plotting in the shadows so far, will also take an active role. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU has called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some statements to the loyalist towards the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel cannot be Chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the national victory of 2005, is re-established with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide her disappointment about the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, the crisis of the Social Democrats on the other hand still lasts.
The SPD reached its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria at 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even an opposition representative entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers it is the sign of well-being and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead is explained by the frauds committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathering under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections held in the circumstances discussed, "gave some representatives" in the parliament.
The ODS has thus renounced a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz crossing the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians considered anti-Democratic Belarusian can not enter for the political situation.
It referred to a relaxation that the OSCE in assessing the electoral campaign placed emphasis on positive movements and not on failures, such as the ban on running for a third of the opposition candidates.
The OSCE's swift report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - he told our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition presidential candidate of the 2006 elections, it is desirable that he remain despite the fact that "power was afraid to allow even one opponent into a weightless parliament".
The opposition does not anticipate actions to protest the results but rather tries to send the message to the voters of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that even the officially most assisted class, that of pensioners, considers adequate the regime of Lukashenko who considers its main result the creation of social security.
Due to the country's debt and rising economic deficit, it is only a matter of time before the disintegration of social security "reminiscent of the sepulchral silence" - Milinkevich believes.
Contrary to the opposition politician, Russian observers deemed the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today this new measure starts against clever people, against those who stamp and then goes to have a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services," says the minister.
"Now a new season of accountability and transparency is opening up.
This is reformism," Brunetta said.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary-general assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a nice cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand.”
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister then announces that "in three months the absences due to illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people at work in a year".
He added that it is necessary to make the public administration more efficient.
In Italy, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants have joined together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service flags today numbers about the lower absenteeism at work due to causes of disease - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'operated slugs' is constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees in Italy have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar will be contested the exclusion of additional economic treatment for infirmity dependent on service; the extension of the hours of availability of the sick worker, within which checks are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Accidents work, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, the INAIL data confirm that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the tragic reports of these days confirm how crucial is the issue of prevention at work," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "strong appreciation for the constant associative commitment in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
“Of course, an indignant ‘enough’ has arisen, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but daily reality again proposes dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness by young people who come to the world of work take on particular significance.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to give up on the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a decisive commitment to urgently put an end to it".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive," said the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
In fact, we would not want this “downward trend” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is relaxed that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that too little is still being done at a general level to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of the workers, and this from the world of the school".
"An additional effort is needed - he added - with regard to communication and public awareness.
But above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection provided for victims of work" and "the welfare drift towards which the system is pushing in recent years".
"The objective is therefore to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - so that the fate of those who are injured should not depend on spontaneity or granting from time to time ordered by the legislator."
MP3 Players Are At Risk of Hearing
Listening to high-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
In a statement released in Brussels, the European Commission cited the opinion of the EU’s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (Csrseri) published today.
“From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day holding the device at a high volume are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high acoustic levels may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“The scientific findings reveal a clear risk and we must react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We also need to review existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
"Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar equipment."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
You can greatly limit this damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment if they listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the limits currently in force regarding the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods are at risk of permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of the users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives the start to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June it will draw the sums.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will finalise the guidelines for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - Alemanno emphasizes - It will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome that the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the City Council, can then make use of.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then he will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time frame.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Roma Capitale".
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and also as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Too often politics overwhelms the management of daily life and the emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working with seriousness on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome would like to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a wagon: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to Roman citizens and it will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences expressed by the Capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, neither closed nor immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital but "also in consideration of the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to pass for independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are escalating just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big hard face: He believes he will win the highest office in a nation that has had two black governors and five black senators in all!”
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are attacks clearly of a racial nature and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
There are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the voting booth we know who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mindset comes out keeping it covered to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicked in the ass.
In Iraq 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush’s weak spot.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to perform.
In the United States, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, "killer" of print.
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Nowadays, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the reporters did not openly state that they were less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want traditional journalism as understood by the general public to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is going the wrong way.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Major publishing houses are opening a door to the internet, for many seen as the "murderer" of print.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it “does something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between those who run the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “safety of work.”
Executives who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are at 47% nationwide.
For staff reporters, it is 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under a contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and the internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it”, take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn even $10,000 a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to get to 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, to their admission, get “sick” often throughout the year.
It's all about the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the counter-pact concerning the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
During the trial against him, last week, he obtained the release from house arrest transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel the way from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
According to the court, however, these moves (to which the PM has given an opposing opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence accusing him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the bailout of $ 700 billion launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
Yesterday’s New York Times confirms this by informing us that the ongoing crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to the “those of Washington” and to the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, in fact, which became prepotently alive with the vow of which I said at the beginning.
However, this is only one example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake may foretell or already reveal: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not here alone.
Both in the United States and in Europe the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of phenomena in incubation for a long time that in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the double category State-sovereignty in relation to a sort of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, close ties with foreign countries, but which first and foremost see involved to a very large extent the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, by the way, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of the question or not to have much to say: the clearest proof is given by the European Union, which, as usual, divides between different interests and between different state strategies fails to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and revival plans, new rules, and above all the disbursement of funds: since when you get to the narrow are only the states that own the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back on track.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, which probably no market or international organization will ever have to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will have to cope to an increasing extent with those very little immaterial things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are still absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So that the one who finds himself sovereign, certainly possesses several more cards than the one who is not, to the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty which, however, foreshadows a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand for someone who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, economic species, proved so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And at the same time something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
That is to say, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites so far on the rise, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, has made its own time and is increasingly alien to the opinions of the majorities, seems to be gaining ground in vast sectors of the population.
The demand for American leadership, in short, underground feeds a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and of the traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden electoral "revolts" or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of these last and very last times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the Granbell consensus in Italy.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats, someone would say, are finding it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not now taking shape in the deeper strata of Western societies and which the economic crisis is reinvigorating, increasing, potentially agitating.
In the face of all this, to speak of a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes wide open certainly isn’t.
The super glue for walking on walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
With a sticker measuring just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers were able to hold a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that manage to ensure a perfect grip on the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "detaches easily from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALKING ON WALLS? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may relate to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented an adhesive formed by microfibers like hair that self-clean from dust while moving on a surface to always maintain a perfect grip.
Medications: Never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some life-saving medications, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with taking certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: it is enough to put a glass of grapefruit juice, some orange and apple health saving effects to reduce the absorption.
Grapefruit juice had already come under indictment because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs to levels considered toxic.
The same Italian Agency of the drug had given news in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPEL - According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear, do not impress us but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification.
Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the major critics of the Bush administration's choices in foreign economics and politics.
A few months after the September 2001 bombings, in the days of Enron's failure, Krugman predicted in an editorial in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for U.S. history.
A prediction that triggered not a few controversies and that for years was reproached to the economist, but that has now proved accurate.
“I’m surprised and also a bit shocked by the speed with which memories of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "greatly valuable economist", but also a whistleblower with a style "very aggressive, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from the home to the office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem watches, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and to the interface revised and made less spartan, are added other more substantial as the native compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and the support for the new version ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2.
Also pay attention to the interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the graphics typical of the format of Adobe with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during revision.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or at work.
And if the theme of free can be a drag for diffusion in homes, it is precisely in the business sector that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there are also realities that offer a training, consulting and assistance service ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding videowriting of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulo presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are at almost 3,600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the jersey of best climber.
The news is reported by the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third generation EPO, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place in the Tour and will face the two years of canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation EPO is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told The Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot jersey for best climber.
IMMIGRATE:NEW YORK TIMES ASKS,ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "from a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" reluctantly welcomed.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that dedicated a long article to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the NYT calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism.”
Students victims of expensive-rents up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious character to the point of excluding entire bands of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the office of studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that it triggers a process of generalized increase also for residents ".
In most cases, the lease offers also contain a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, without limit of fees, sub-rents linked.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, you need about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Bands area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fair) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas close to the University, you need 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you need 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is finally another anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee charged to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historic rooms
Historic movie theaters close in favor of multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of the large multi-sales and the consequent death by consumption of mono-sales in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem inescapable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
Often disappearing are historical places and loads of memory, "it is as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we have shared a piece of the road and many emotions," observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago earned Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and that told the poetry of a provincial room and the nostalgia for a way of living perhaps always lost cinema
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of retailers, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the biggest hit is paid by the cinemas in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And as proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new multi-screen cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures are built but it would be necessary to guarantee the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of allocation for the fund in favor of the merchants: the debt receivable of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect the existing laws.
To support the sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about closures, decided to run for cover with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-screen cinemas both in the historic center and on the outskirts.
Among the rules provided are tax relief measures for operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special rates for the stop and in some parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counter the overpowering of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema di Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have experienced many shared emotions, not to see the billboards blackened by dust I turn to the other side.
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the Municipality to the interests of the cosca Piromalli".
There are heavy accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address to the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in a mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, namesake of the boss, already convicted of association for mafia criminal, sentenced to compensate 10 million euros.
"In defiance of any legal and moral norm, as well as common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been thus allowed to the cosca - write the judges - to enter officially inside the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already enormous, of control and address of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional junta, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized crime" exist in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Pyromalli thigh.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a center-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called in the then deputy minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having designed the whole thing for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the piromalli cosca had even come to ask for the variation of the project of the A3.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pm, emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Pyromalli, uniformizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When the energy is born from the waves now the big ones come into the field
It is an exterminated field, occupying more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources they’ve set their sights on, and now they’re trying to get their hands on, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalist demands and the new rise in oil are giving momentum to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by swell systems.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
Colossi on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in Northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, betting on marine energy is becoming more and more and among these companies have always been devoted to traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesperson for a company affiliated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a sign, especially considering that the US continues to extract oil in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the road of energy that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate, according to observers, an interest on the rise.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants like the one in Portugal or some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the buoys to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such plants under design, pending federal approval only, and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, meanwhile, already produces power for a mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water when there are tides rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotary movement that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine, and Alaska, along with others on the coast, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and planned up to $35 million in 2009.
