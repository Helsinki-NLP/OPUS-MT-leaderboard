In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a benchmark, meaning that scientists used it as a basis and compared the other three treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee’s letter and accepts the Olympic family’s absolute need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and the sport they practice, can be better served by implementing significant changes in our organization than by withdrawing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports conducting an independent investigation, which can shed light on how abuses of the proportions so bravely described by those abused by Larry Nassar could go unnoticed for so long, and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal – to make sports gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible for athletes to follow their dream in a safe, positive and permissive atmosphere.

This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered with feathers, an already widespread hypothesis, but also provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown in the upper part, with a light or orange color in the lower part.
The discovery also provides insight into how birds’ feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called rachis, but have other characteristic features of feathers—beards and beards—the researchers concluded that rachis was probably an evolutionary development that arose from the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or impression. Researchers have suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not chicken fluff.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the plumage of a chicken.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two policemen and injured more than 20 people.
The governor's office said nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged Daesh militant (ISIL) of being responsible for the attack.
They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in magnetic inversions.

He added that “they should not, however, be required to assume obligations that go beyond their level of development, responsibility and capabilities.”
The Iraq study group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
No one can guarantee at this time that any intervention in Iraq will stop sectarian war, escalating violence or a slide into chaos.
The report opens with a plea for an open debate and consensus-building in the United States on Middle East policy.
The report is extremely critical of almost every aspect of the executive’s current policy towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first recommendation of the 78 he made was to launch a new diplomatic action before the end of this year in order to secure Iraq’s borders against hostile intervention and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the galaxy’s dark matter and the Milky Way’s dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is composed of a lot of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
“In an interview, he said the new variant is ‘very disturbing and worrying because of the very high mortality rate.’”
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with TB appears to be still low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at some point in South Africa.

"All the entrances to the caves, which have been called 'The Seven Sisters', have a diameter of between 100 and 250 meters (328 to 820 feet)."
Infrared images show that temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood that they are caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is compatible with the hypothesis that they would represent holes deep in the ground," said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeological Team of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff.
In France, voting has traditionally been a little technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope indicating which candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law codifies rather strictly the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of properly counted and authorised voters.
In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, subject to clear procedures.

The UN peacekeepers, who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, are blamed for the spread of the disease, whose outbreak broke out near the troops' camp.
According to the process, the waste from the UN camp was not properly sanitized, causing bacterial contamination of the tributary of the Artibonite River, one of the largest in Haiti.

In the other race she took part in, the giant slalom finished tenth in the women's seating group, with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes after the first-come, Australian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes after the ninth-place competitor, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four women's skiers in the seated position failed to finish their tour, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to get a place in the competition.
Police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: “We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and laptop.”
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the charges appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road to the accident was temporarily closed until emergency services pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Sheriff's Court in Edinburgh.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered because her image was widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have decided that publishing the photos can be harmful.
“Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that ‘journalists seem to be playing with fire by posting photos and other information about suspects.’”
The Crown Prosecutor’s Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, has told reporters that it will not make further comments at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants drawn on the basis of pre-war borders in the Middle East in 1967.
Other themes addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims that after signing the agreement, it will have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
The hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by the foresters, the test being monitored and its effectiveness subjected to evaluation.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sports Hunting Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited, based on the hunting program of the Sports Hunting Association.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Executive Director for Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation benefited from comprehensive safety and training training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to direct the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns in four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MECI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
“Last week, METI announced that Apple reported another 34 overheating incidents, which the company said were ‘not serious.’”
“The ministry responded, saying Apple’s delay was ‘really regrettable.’”
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has held tourists in Hong Kong hostage, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographs.
Later, photographs took the place of an elderly woman who needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the Auckland National Women's Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began in his spare time to investigate premature labor.
His research has shown that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
“Tommy Dreamer said that ‘The Moon was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. The Moon died in the night two months ago. A unique moment, as she was. A strong woman.’”
“Dustin Runnels, nicknamed ‘Golden Powder,’ commented that ‘The moon was as eccentric as I was... maybe even more... I love it and will miss it... I hope it’s in a better place.’”
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her view, Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign is over.
34% of respondents agree with this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympics was to swim at the Commonwealth Games, in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle, as well as in three relay events, but his physical condition was questioned due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medicines to control the pain, which were prohibited during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Several people verified the discovery before early February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth’s water supply, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his rule earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to travel shorter distances, thus saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and decreasing carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, unlike older ground-based radar systems, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more accurate information to pilots.
Additional transportation is not available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and public transport facilities are not available in the area.
Fears about the lack of means of transport brought into question the possibility of organizing the match behind closed doors, in the absence of the team’s supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between endemic Darwin stings, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus stingray, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in a multitude of patterns. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into thin yarns that can be twisted and braided. It can be beaten with a hammer or rolled into sheets.
It can be made so thin, that sometimes it was used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean and wet hands, form a ball of them.
The moisture present on the hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewer system.
Debris from sewage systems has been found in houses in the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used in common.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do it via a satellite.
The satellite in the space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and sight.
It takes a huge, 100-foot-high rocket to take a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has given us was to give us a much easier and faster shipping.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them we have several medium-sized felines, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free pet cats) that eat much more of the numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche; each cat has its own role to fulfill, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called packs.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with surprisingly lion-like behavior (but not other large felines), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances, and shoot with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers fall into the same group (Panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the roar of a lion’s full voice, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents or birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than this.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing the ground to find them.
Thanks to night vision, they can see very well in the dark and can move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaged themselves in the environment in which they are, then throwing themselves on the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they come (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The initial population has not changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say that they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e., expel it from the lungs).
Plants produce their food from the sun, through photosynthesis. In addition, they make shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaur was the leading predator of its time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 sharp bladed teeth, along with an extra set in the mouth, meaning that nothing in the way would get away with it.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue. His food included turtles, large fish, other species of mosasaur, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that goes into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could have dealt with it.
While much of their kitchen would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a peach.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate while sitting in chairs, rich men liked to make banquets in which they lay on their sides while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include dishes that arrived in Europe, from America or Asia, in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman has ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were also built.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was spent in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were just the counters that gave way to the street.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was very expensive.
In the Scandinavian saga it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further west, he found Green Land and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of the discoveries he made, tribes of Eskimos already lived in those places at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a map of a treasure.
"On the back of the declaration of independence, the words 'Original of the Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776' can be read.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is still known that, at its beginning, the large parchment document (measuring 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) had been kept rolled.
Thus, the marking was probably made simply for labelling.
The D-Day landings and ensuing battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
“It was led by the French ‘from Vichy.’ These were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working alongside the invaders instead of fighting them.”
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was dubbed Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American forces along with free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people living and working cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, being related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and to civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of society.
A civilizing culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as actual civilizations.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – Congress being its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its decisions.
It also had no authority to override laws and tax rates between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, ranks second in the world's most successful teams and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
There are almost 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the island groups Japan has, it is often said that Japan is geographically an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan took place long ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, beginning a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1984–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
The somewhat confusing 35mm format is actually 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., family of APS formats) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to her, the best place for positioning the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to it.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
His ubiquitous power affected everyone, from king to common mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether the principle was indeed respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved effective, interrupting the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted provisions of international law, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unbridled submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents in his pocket, a poem book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different time periods; each stage of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
The periods between successive dynasties were also marked by divided provinces. The most well-known interval of this kind was the Three Kingdoms Period, over 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were bitter wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to occupy the throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist to a republican, nationalist system, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to be successful.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the armed hierarchy based on class, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things that went beyond the worldly. He used to go often to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira", located on Mount "Noor" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know its existence. Once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has stood to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau, also called the 'Necropolis of Giza' in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the highest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples, and the great Sphinx."
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, caves, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
“The ‘upside’ mark looks like a V, and the ‘downside’ mark looks like a staple or square that lacks the bottom.”
Up means that you have to start from the top and push the bow; down means that you have to start from the frog (i.e. in the part where you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A bow feature up usually generates a softer sound, while a downward feature is stronger and more determined.
Do not hesitate to signify your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for the features of the bow are there for musical reasons, and normally, they must be observed.
On 6 October 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a mob of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They moved back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and screaming threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen's eyes.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to bear much of the expenses and interest on bonds placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history spanning the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a related logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has “effects” on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of cars.
A large number of car owners lead to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injury.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began to spread through 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silk and spices more prized than what the Byzantine markets offered.
This was the moment when the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, western styles can be 25 to 30 years old.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advances of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological, system that uses preserved seeds from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers dealt with subsistence agriculture and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel sidelined by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or sex of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
"Such children are called 'untamed' or wild. Some wild children have been seized by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to rejection by the parents, due to severe intellectual or physical impairments."
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when bred entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or construction site method is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little staple man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are included in the software, having the role of interrogating, providing clues and explaining procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in family care for numerous reasons, ranging from negligence to abuse, even going as far as extortion.
There should not be children who grow up in an environment where they are deprived of food, love and education, but there is.
We perceive the family care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring caregivers, solid education and reliable healthcare.
Family care is supposed to cover the needs of children, who were not covered in the house they had previously been in.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct other features of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of addressing the types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuous relationships” were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it can be observed whether a person lies through the correct interpretation of facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper “The President’s Speech,” showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage still manage to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause each generation’s direction of variation to be dominated by one or the other of the two genetic backgrounds.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet the requirements of amino acids from available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were leafy proteins and legumes, but these are hard to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
Unlike these, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of protein that contain all the essential amino acids.
“Given all this, it shouldn’t surprise us if our ancestors solved the ‘protein problem’ in a way similar to the chimpanzees in today’s savannahs.”
Sleep disruption is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during your normal period of sleep to re-sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a conscious state without waking up fully.
If you happen to reset the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other options based on biorhythm involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bedtime, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace that a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one’s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, to which the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga have been added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process, and culture led to the two countries' distancing.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last forty years and will be fought seriously, by “delegated” armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans became useless almost overnight, however, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers were put into motion creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after they invaded eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one part of the ocean to another.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples in this regard was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have managed to occupy Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
The goats appear to have been tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to home for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing grounds, usually in the care of goats who were often children or teenagers, similar to well-known sheepmen.
Wagonways have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on slightly more irregular roads at the time.
The crossbars were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place; however, it was gradually concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal strip on top.
This became a widespread practice, but iron led to faster wear of the wagons' wooden wheels.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning the right man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked bipedal seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to some extent reduce future suffering.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are greater now because of humanity’s overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
"Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as 'Dunlap posters.'"
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July; a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap posters still in existence are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds you can still see many features similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both back legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values, 0 or 1, respectively, and the name of these numbers is binary digits or bits, in the jargon of computer science.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication for an internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "cockroach" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the ancient resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer cockroaches and bedbugs are nests, adapted to the nest life or home of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which means it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is neither in their interest nor in the child’s interest.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one, however, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have mainly used classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas on all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West awoke separate from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important evidence in favor of the DNA hypothesis.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments marking either the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism organized around the exploration of nature attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning more about Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people leave the small villages of the countryside by car to go to their jobs, passing by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has sustained human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or the collapse of bridges are rarely encountered in developed countries.
Why do transport systems give rise to such dissatisfactions, why do they fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something worse?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying the flow of traffic is unfortunately difficult, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to remain within reasonable constant limits; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and partners for mating much more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that can’t fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerids.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; namely that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don’t feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans of the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and accumulates water from thousands of smaller waters.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical mastery of construction.
Ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known some fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, issued a theory according to which everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air and fire.
Rather, he recalled the four states of matter, (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he had theorized that it would turn into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys may also include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing media emerged, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to get their hands on a sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something new will appear.
The fission pump operates on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy wagon up the hill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decompose with a small or no impulse.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km in the near part and 100 km in the far part.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker in areas of higher relief.
It may be more large in the near part, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying elements that attract people’s attention or pleasure.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with development through maturity.
These theories study what makes some want to do what they do, and what their surroundings may or may not do.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Pyramid of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behaviors can occur when managers begin to lead former colleagues. One extreme is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, in carrying out disciplinary actions, performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and empowering people.
On the other side of the spectrum, people are turning into unrecognizable individuals who believe they need to change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to breaks between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The “Invisible Team” is the management team to which each of the members gives the report. The invisible team sets the standards for each of the members.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When in the functional departments of an organization all available resources are used in an efficient way, creativity and ingenuity can be freely manifested.
As a result, the process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to get organizations to achieve higher performance.
Data from neurobiology is the physical evidence behind a theoretical approach to cognitive investigation. As such, it allows the area of research to be narrowed and defined with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and adapting intelligence to machines.
AI research involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, but a few software applications for personal computers and video games have also been used.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the solution with virtual tours. Students can watch museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while in class.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the site is remodeled, and previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
While students often start their blogging experience with negligent grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Since students often represent the most critical audience, the blog author begins to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
“Also, blogging ‘obliges students to be more aware of the world around them.’ The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).”
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their study far beyond the regular school day.
“The proper use of blogs ‘can help students to think more analytically and more critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of those written by others, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues’ (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital, offering a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka District and more.
These and many more highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian par excellence.
Large portions further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that has the gift to surprise many: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The eastern islands of Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the maritime route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any traveling woman say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is good to wear a wedding ring, but not to look expensive.
Women need to take into account that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it is not out of the ordinary to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be determined when you refuse a man and don’t be afraid to stand firm in the position (cultural differences or not, it still doesn’t mean it’s OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans and Mariners, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the Old Medina is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of all kinds of scraps, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the eastern extreme, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, for visits outside the city an information effort is required to understand at what stage the fighting is still being waged in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trail trips in Africa.
To travel through Goma you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price of a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Along with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used metaphorically with the meaning of exotic, remote places."
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in sharp contrast to the rest of the country’s cities, as it has a more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different kind of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of this country’s national parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry into either a number of South African parks or all of South Africa’s national parks.
The name Hong Kong Territory is given by the island of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists regard as the focal point.
The exhibition of buildings contributing to the Hong Kong skyline has been resembled by a bright bar chart that is highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon, on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the urban developed part of Hong Kong Island is crammed into recovered land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that British settlers themselves have appropriated, and therefore, for those who are looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching over 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps – they also comprise some of the last few swamps of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is to be found covered by water/swamp.
Beginning in 1966, Sundarbans became a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengali tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses connecting districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Dividing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby sights such as Paro (150 No) or Punakha (200 No).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge on the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two strips of 3.50 meters wide.
The free passage height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully functional in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important group of indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the Giant Province of the Indies, was born in the 16th century after the Spanish conquistadors met their indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has, with great effort, preserved much of its indigenous identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for the polo games, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is established as the equivalent of 1 Pound Sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley face-to-face with the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted frequently.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they will probably receive British and American currency; contact the owners early to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland liras outside the country, so you need to change them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below freezing point, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
“There are no particularly ‘rainy’ or ‘dry’ seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.”
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, respectively 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile it may seem, the buffalo, elk, bear and almost all other large animals can attack man.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept the correct distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so it is good to give them their space.
In addition, be careful that the smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid strong-smelling foods and keep the camping spot clean.
Apia is the capital of the state of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval confrontation of sad remembrance in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the supreme chieftain Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is between two ports. The most famous of these are in three areas.
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbour District), located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where you can swim safely, and most have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a wide palette of shops arranged along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can find many French wines, but New Zealand or Australian would go better.
Local tap water is drinkable, but if you are afraid you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino comes filled with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are peppered as price, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay more attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be found outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be directed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp on site, and most of the participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll have to get there early to catch a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main scenes is over, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, as sailing through the ice makes unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempted from the visa requirement (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent here by customers and the money spent by them. Usually, there are no windows and clocks, and exits can hardly be found.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep the mood and guests to stay in the place.
Some clubs offer alcoholic beverages from the house. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay lucid.
Those who will drive to high latitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On frozen and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive like on dry asphalt.
During the blizzard, in a very short interval, enough snow can fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or viscous or condensation, or ice formation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the main tourist attraction of Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to land trips undertaken to see the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you’ll be able to see them better using binoculars.
“A walking safari (also called ‘a walk through the bushes’, ‘safari hike’, or ‘downhill hike’) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or a few days.”
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you have booked your flight and accommodation tickets for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may be facing a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March, cancellation policies for coronavirus reasons did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets to events are expected to cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, with regular tickets costing around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if they do not exist in the room.
If you don’t have an iron at your disposal or if you don’t like to wear ironed stockings, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one at hand.
Be careful not to let the material overheat (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
The filters differ from one another in their level of efficiency, and if you are worried, consider the option of buying water in closed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation, or in severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person using physical force, are generally not considered harmful.
Duty-free shopping in certain places gives you the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duty.
Travellers visiting high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The portion between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult traffic conditions along the entire stretch of the Buffalo–Pittsburgh Highway, often traversing secluded and unmanned areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes and dangerous curves prevail.
Speed limits are significantly lower than in previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important to strictly respect them.
However, quite bizarrely, the mobile service is much more powerful here than along many other portions of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, peanuts and other nuts. Often popular cakes go very well with a cup of hard coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, taste what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a food based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
“A curry can be ‘dry’ or ‘liquid’ depending on the amount of liquid.”
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without other qualifications, however, the term tends to indicate food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of simple-spiced dishes, with peanuts, hot peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored spices being the predominant favorite flavors of Javanese.
The stairs support the rider's legs, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They give the rider better stability, but they can pose safety concerns as it is possible that a rider’s legs get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from the saddle, but remains with a foot hanging from the ladder, the horse can drag him after himself when he takes it to the race. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear heeled riding boots and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the ladder straps to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider who falls from the saddle.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s most sought-after place for climbing, known as South America’s Yosemite, with a variety of high granite walls and peaks.
The peaks offer stunning views from their peaks. Climbers from all over the world are continually tracing new routes through the walls with unlimited potential.
Sports involving descent on snow, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, consisting of sliding down on the snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the legs.
“Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called ‘ski bums’ in English, who organize whole holidays around skiing in a certain place.”
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have cave paintings depicting skiers from before 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called skiing in unmarked areas, touring skiing or hiking on skis.
It is a related activity, but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you’ll be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking – but very rarely you’ll be able to reach typical cross-country speeds without a heavy backpack on neat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean repeatedly going through visa and passport control procedures.
In this sense, the Schengen area is organized in a way as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do so at passport checkpoints.
Similarly, those who have a Schengen visa do not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen member countries individually, thus saving time, money and documents to be obtained.
There is no universal definition of what items produced are antiques. Some tax agencies consider antiques to be goods older than 100 years.
The definition varies by geographic location, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced objects.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of income among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many who have other trades.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population have been involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as burden animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
“Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word ‘gypsy’ is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population.”
If the country you are visiting is the subject of a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than yours, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
An example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified way, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Extreme weather" is a generic term used for any type of dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disturbance or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and are of many kinds, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the risks of severe weather that affect the area, as it could mess up their travel plans.
It is recommended that anyone planning to travel to a country that can be considered a war zone receive professional training.
An Internet search for “hostile environment course” will probably give you the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through hands-on experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, plenty of first aid and sometimes gun training.
The books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are quite numerous, but the publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo a sex change operation in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
Opening up governments to the possibility of issuing passports that do not state the sex (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies equally.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive after 9/11.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through scans without affecting their privacy and dignity.
Return currents represent the flow back to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often to a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there can form a rapid current to the deep waters.
Most deaths occur because of exhaustion in trying to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once the current is out, swimming is not more difficult than normal.
Try to move to a position where you are not trapped again, and depending on the skills you have and whether or not someone has seen you, you may want to wait to be saved.
The shock of returning home manifests faster than the cultural shock (it persists less of the euphoria of the honeymoon), has a longer duration and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture, sometimes encounter special difficulties in readapting to their native culture.
If you returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost the habits of your native culture.
When you had just gone abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, being aware that visiting a new country requires an adaptation process.
The world doesn’t always expect patience and understanding to be necessary for travelers returning home.
The show of sounds and lights organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
The noise made by tourists and sellers is usually heard all the time. The sound and light show seems to come from a storybook.
The sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the south of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The mountains of the peninsula unite to give rise to this plateau, then separate again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, separated in two by the Minnesota glacier.
In the north, called the Sentinel Range, lies the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m.
In secluded places with no phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot take the place of a cell phone because you have to be outside with an unobstructed view to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions that require remote transmission of data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider may give you more information about connecting to this service.
An alternative increasingly used by people planning a year off is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before going to a university, without jeopardizing their educational path.
In many cases, enrolling in one year of delayed courses abroad can even increase your chances of accessing higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programs.
“Finland is a wonderful place for canoeing. ‘The land of a thousand lakes’ also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.”
In archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is from 1 to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore on board a ship, you will not need a separate visa (beginning in 2009)
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means close to the sea and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things, which manifests itself in many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming the fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is essential in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies own their own aircraft, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they have sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and customs clearance.
The only way to make it pass faster was to be sent as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and here you intervene.
The obvious way to fly first class or business is to pay a large pile of money for this privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do it for you).
But it is not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare in business class and up to eleven times more in first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business class or class I seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and comfortable, context in which they charge rates according to requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from an inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
The economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Christian-Orthodoxism.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir is Turkey's third-largest city with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second-largest port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed and modern commercial center, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with the glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers, feature traditional red tile roofs from the 18th century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby Eysturoy Island and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the courtyard of the church, there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons above tombs.
It is worth spending half an hour strolling through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which has become outside the country’s borders following an enthusiastic review of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north you can visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that, in principle, you visit the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived the internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work until death there, both Jews and others.
You are asked to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by drawing and scratching existing structures.
Barcelona’s official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and practically all know Spanish.
However, most panels are made only in Catalan, as this is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport, along with other services.
Periodic announcements at the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
“Although it is often just a stereotype not in line with reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is ‘bien élevé’ (well raised). It will help you cope with much easier.”
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and elevation levels.
The region is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, laughter, wild cat and mountain cock can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer covers for women who come unprepared, but if you bring yours, especially one in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or the mother at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear pants to cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after every use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available spices such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always begin with capital letters, even within the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or an adjective being used in a noun form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters that you need to pay more attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel after them.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively light and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
Obviously, those who know a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish can draw the premature conclusion that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated today and remain open as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, it is usually found in cities or on campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas that have favorable weather conditions.
The cherry blossom view, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.
Plants look nowhere better than in their natural environment, so don’t be tempted to pick even “only one” of them.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "spices" will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can easily orient yourself and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
“But being in the ‘upper tropics,’ just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll have to face both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when it’s clear, less).”
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, where according to tradition the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were buried, along with their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take is going to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland waters can be a good theme for organizing a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions pertaining to this feast have been adopted by both unbelievers in Christian countries and non-Christians throughout the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake, outdoors, to see the sunrise.
There are of course explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditionalist churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening on Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the distance from the mainland, mammals have not been able to undertake the journey, the result being that the giant turtle is the main animal that grazes in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit areas of the Arctic or Antarctica in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars as well.
The Japanese culture of work has a stronger hierarchical and more formal character than that to which Westerners are accustomed.
Costumes represent the standard clothing in the business environment, and co-workers address each other using their surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is an essential element, focusing on group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often have to get their superiors’ approval for all the decisions they make and expect them to follow their superiors’ instructions without discussion.
