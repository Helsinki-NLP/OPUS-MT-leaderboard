When a small group of creatures live apart from the main population (as if they move to mountains or rivers, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot return easily, they will often find different environments than they did before.
This new environment has a different resource and competitive competition, so a new population needs different features or adaptments to become a stronger competition than they ever needed.
His original theory hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adapter as it had before.
In time, when new populations are beginning to adapt to their new environment, they seem to have diminished like other populations.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will seem very different until they cannot be called the same species.
We call it a spectacular process, which means the formation of new species.

He even proposes that the ability to interpret human behavior like that may have an animal like a pet.
A 20th - century study shows that there are two genetic variations: hidden and revealed.
The feature adds new genetic variations, while the selection removes it from the group of expression variations.
Segregation and recombination combine back and forth between two pools with each generation.
In the plains, it's hard for primates to deal with human digestive systems to meet the needs of amino acids from available nabat.
In addition, failure in doing so has a serious effect — the growth depression, poor nutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily acquired drug source is protein on leaves and nuts, but it's hard to find for primates as we do, unless it's cooked.
Instead, animal food is not only easy to digest, but it also provides a high amount of protein that contains all important amino acids.
By considering all things, we shouldn't be surprised when our ancestors deal with " protein" in a way that's almost similar to the storeers in the countryside right now.

The tracks were introduced from the beginning to keep track in place, but slowly realized that the track would be more efficient when it had an iron layer on it.
It became a general practice, but iron caused wooden wheels to be more damaged.
In the end, wheels were replaced by metal wheels.
