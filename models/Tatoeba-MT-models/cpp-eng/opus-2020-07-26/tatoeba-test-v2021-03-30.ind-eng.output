I'm happy to see how much I can do to help him.
Learning about foreign culture is fun.
When did you start using the lens?

Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to call us back.
Without fear, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnic and minority religions.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife was too dull until it couldn't be used to cut flesh, eventually I used my pocket knife.
And his eyes are blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's a forgetr.
Where have you been?
Lights are used to regulate traffic.
Don't let Tom see these photos.
This room gets a little sunshine.
He's painting a picture.
I shouldn't have breached that red light.

Want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I think I can come this afternoon.
"It's not worth us waiting for two hours." "Yes, this signature I'll keep for a lifetime."
Tom is one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.

You'll never be able to find a way home, through a narrow road of rocks.

The birthday card is coming.
Please read it one more time.

Tom's nearly hit.
I'm going too.
Love is never wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The cost was already made for professional services to finish the survey.
You don't really want to study logogram, do you?
Tom tried to persuade Mary to help her.
Two things are not related.
How can I not realize this?
What is this called?

That's the right answer.
Usually, men run faster than women.
For me, there's no fundamental difference between the culture of both countries.
He's having an affair.
Wake me up at eight o'clock right.
Tell me why he didn't attend.
That might affect their decision.

Tom's getting jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy you this bag.
The cake is too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Have you ever gone to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready.
Mary refused an invitation to concert.
When are you going home?

The boy's sleeping in his bed for a while.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left side of the street.
He's focused on those riddles.

This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is his acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid to fly with a plane.
I've been guessing that he's lying, but that doesn't make me surprised.
I don't have a choice.
I can't finish reading this thick book within a week.
The choice of the time was very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any choice.
I'm not sure what else I have to do.
We've done what we can.
Any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
In front of our law, but the rich sometimes have more advantage.
He'll make it.
I like cats.
It's over at nine o'clock.
Tom is mentally disturbed.
Could I be crazy?
We're facing a very difficult winter.
I have to ask you a question, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone welcomes.
Everyone's done something wrong.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mother's been without ten years.
No one's perfect.

Six degrees down zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!

Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom lied to Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of students are going to continue education to university.
Tom put the pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom got his voice down so no one can hear it.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he long hair?
She greeted him every morning, when she entered a school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very steep, it's better over the left.

I'm tired.
Everyone who knows him admires him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those people are crazy!
