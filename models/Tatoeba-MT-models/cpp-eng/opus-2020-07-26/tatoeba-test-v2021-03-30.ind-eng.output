I'm trying to write about ethnic and minority religions.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife was too dull until it couldn't be used to cut flesh, eventually I used my pocket knife.

Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy you this bag.
The cake is too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.

I can't finish reading this thick book within a week.
The choice of the time was very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any choice.
I'm not sure what else I have to do.
We've done what we can.
Any more questions?
