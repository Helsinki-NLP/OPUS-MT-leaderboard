How long has this symptoms last?
And all chest pain must be handled this way especially at your age
And with fever.
And the blood pressure and the carboneserol you also need to be checked
And are you fever now?
And do you feel this chest pain now?
And are you also having trouble breathing?
And can you tell me other symptoms you're experiencing with these symptoms?
And how high has your fever been?
And I'm also coughing
And I'm a little pill and a cough.
And I feel severe chest pain today
And it's highly allergic season.
And it feels chest pain.
And I think I'm also a little fever.
And I want you to explain where your chest pain is
And they're also fever.
And with your diabetes history
And you know, my chest feels like it's gonna be broken
And you know, people are always coughing towards me
And you feel chest pain
And you say there's pressure in your chest
Anyone in a family with heart disease, heart disease, heart attack, high blood count, high blood pressure
Is there any symptoms or other problems you notice with muscle pain?
Is there anyone else who is sick like you at home with the same symptoms?
Do you feel another symptoms?
Have you ever felt asphyxiated?
Do you still feel chest pain?
Because it's the flu season.
But neither can we add to the pain of the chest that comes from the heart
But the more important problem now is this chest pain
And I had trouble breathing
But I knew a lot of stoney people toward me
But we have to handle every chest pain very seriously
But now you can breathe well?
I totally forgot the cause of this chest pain
Does it feel like there's someone who's wearing your chest?
It still feels like breathing.
Do they complain about the same symptoms?
Do you have chronic problems like high blood pressure or something?
Do you have any medical problems or other chronic illness like diabetes?
Do you feel exhausted together with that chest pain?
Are you suffering from high blood pressure?
Do you feel exhausted with those symptoms?
Do you know what symptoms she has to experience?
Did you see the picture?
Drink plenty of fluids today
But I have diabetes tests.
But he had a rather similar symptoms with me
How high is your fever?
How's your blood pressure?
If your fever continues
If your fever is a hundred or higher
If you think of symptoms or problems you need a better examination
I had a fever yesterday
I'm also a little fever.
I had a fever yesterday
I feel pain stuck here, in the chest.
I'm also having trouble breathing.
I'll send a picture to you
I feel chest pain today
I just feel a little headache and fever today
According to my opinion, it's a flu
In my opinion, it's a little flu
Does it feel like there's someone very heavy sitting on your chest?
All started with fever fever at the same time
It hurts in the middle of my chest
pressure like chest pain
On my chest
In the middle of my chest
In the middle of the chest
I had pain in my chest
I'm so worried about this chest pain
I want you to explain this chest pain
Like high blood pressure or diabetes
It's like right in the middle of the chest.
For the fever, you can drink sweet tachipirina
Mary, how many days have you experienced these symptoms?
You say that you feel chest pain
Sometimes I feel chest pain
All right, is there any other symptoms along with these symptoms besides pain
Or is someone sitting on your chest?
It's almost the same with fever, cough, headaches, and muscle pain
Right in the middle of my chest
Show this picture where you feel sick
Because you're fever
So, do you think some of these symptoms might be related to pregnancy?
So, your kids have some same symptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain
A fever is rising at night
My fever has lasted for two days
A fever was starting to rise last night.
This is Porter's doctor at the center of the triase emergency room.
Can you tell me more about your chest pain?
I feel pain in the front part of my body, here, in the chest.
I feel severe pain in my chest
When I felt the pain in my chest
What pain do you feel in your chest?

You feel like drunk on your chest
Do you know I have diabetes and other diseases?
You say that you feel this chest pain
The rapid rise in the European Union/Wilaak Economic and Britain, January 1 to March 15, 2020
Insulated cases of coronary disease (COVID) show a similar trend in the European Union/Wilak Economic and British Britain confirming that, in spite of its different stages, the ACVIDFDS developed very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should improve the preparation of the LOVID patient who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 20,19, the pneumon case with an unknown ecologist was reported in Witato Province Hubei, China.
On January 9, 20, 2020, the Control and Chinese Disease Center reported this disease agency is a new coronavirus now called a heavy meth disease syndrome.
Since then, the disease that SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronary disease.
Evidence to this day shows that about 80% of COVID sufferers have mild disease, that is, the breathing infection with or without pneumonia, with most of the sufferers healed.
In about 14% cases, the CAVID developed into a heavier disease and needed hospital care, while 6% other cases were afflicted with critical diseases that needed intensive care.
The patients who were treated at the hospital because of COVID, about 4%.
In this study, we're studying the development of the ISIVD 19th-century European Union/Wilak Economic Economic Army (EU/EEA) and England and then compared it with an incident in the Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of current COVID cases in EU/EA and the United States with the number of cases in Italy for January 31 –15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EA and DU
After China's Chinese, COVID19 has a higher geography and the COVID served on the other side of the world today following a pande in China.
On March 11, 2020, the director of the World Health Organization (WHO) expressed COVID 19 as a academy.
In Eurosurvellance 2020 issue of March 5, Spiti et al. report first European people to the COVIDS case confirmed by the definition of WHOO.
In EU/EA, three first confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 on people who returned from Wita, Hubei Province, China.
On March 15, 20, 2020, the COVID-19 case has been detected in all 30 countries EU/EA and the United States (U.S.), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with that date, there are 398 cases and 1.7777) death reported, with 1750 cases and 4441 deaths only of Italy.
Getting my complex number and my graduation incident of the COVID case.
At the National Center of Europe’s Control and Control, the number of cases COVIDS that tell every country around the world is updated every day at 8,00. This number is only from official sources such as the state's Health Foundation, national and regional health authorities, and WHOO.
This data is used to judge the National COVID trend at EU/EA and the U.S.A., and compares it with trend in Italy.
As pre-expectary GIVID case development, we're counting a 14-day-day nammutic incident, so consider the natural journey of COVID-EA, in every state of EU/EA and DUA, in January 1 –15 March 20,20.
We also present the starting number of cases that are confirmed every country until March 15, 2020, compared to the Italian case during January 31 –15Mamret 2020.
Tren COVID-19 in EU/EA and DU
A typical incident took 14 days of COVID 1 day in EU/EA state and is generally following the trend in the Hubei Province.
For the EU/EA and the general benefit of the universe, the series of starting to increase about 21 February 21, and then it's getting sharp about February 28, 2020.
This fruit is especially moved by the rapid increase in cases reported from Italy, but all of the countries of EU/EA are other and the negative show a trend in the development of a similar COVID 19th incident.
Draw 2 shows the beginning of the COVID-19 case in EU/EA and U.S. history compared to the beginning of Italy during January 31 –15 2020.
The data was pointing out that, until 15th of March 8, 15 countries of the EU/EEA country, and the U.S.A. had reported the total number of cases worth of Italian cases in the past three weeks or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases that are known to rise rapidly at EU/EA and dU.
A Tren observed on an incident of COVID's 19th-year-old discovers that pandoms rise at the superior speed in all countries.
It's beyond the range of countries, variations of public health response, and possible differences between legal definitions and protocols to choose patients who have to be tested to confirm the COVID 19th, which include milk testing.
At the beginning of March 20,20, doctors in the peaceful Italian region explained the situation of about 10% of COVID patients in general needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospital and intensive care units in this region have reached its maximum capacity.
Right now, the COVID case recognition data in the hospital and/or intensive care unit at EU/EA is only available to each 6% and 1% cases (not shown).
However, data must be gathered in a systematic way to supply current surveys that are focused on the number of cases reported and number of deaths.
Sttudi, which was done in 2010 20201, showed a great variation in the supply of intensive care and care in Europe, was about to start from 29,2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries could have more or less resources than Italy (for nearly half the bed of intensive care and treatment per 100,000 population in 2010 20201).
Scientists related to the capacity of health care capacity, with the prevalence of the COVID-CD case-of-the-the-Strength case rate for every state EU/EA and U.U.A. to the risk of >90% beyond the capacity of intensive treatment, was provided in the sixth-peration rate of the LDCD.D.D.D.
Because as far as every case is mentioned in a specific region in EU/EA and dUA state, and intensive care units usually serve regional services population, information about cases and intensive sleep - care facilities should be provided at the level of the Unitstage level for Steristic 2 (NUTS-2).
The current experience of Italy and trend in other countries shows that the COVID 19 academy has developed very rapidly in EU/EA and dU.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the scenario of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission transmissions and increase the number of patients who need health care, especially intensive care, as in Italy.
As shown in the quick judgment of the ECC recently, a quick approach, professional, and scholarly approach is vital to slow down the SARS-CoV-2, with a distraction approach to my approach, because the amount of quick cases, as expected, may not allow enough time for the management and hospital decisions to understand, and adapt the response to the previous approach.
That quick risk judgment also sets out the steps of society's health to check the cost.
A short-time window of opportunity when the country has a chance to improve its control efforts in slowing the SARS-CoV-2 field and reduce health care.
If failed, EU/EA health care system is likely to face patients who need intensive care within a few days or weeks to come.
A 2019 coronary disease, caused by heavy respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Chinese and other places in the world, which cause disaster for humanity.
Similar to his gay virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS on thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be extracted from bats and caused symptoms similar through similar mechanisms.
Nevertheless, COVID19 has a lower level of clarity and mortality than SARS, but more infectious and more about older than young people, and more of men than women.
In response to the increase in the number of publications on this new disease, this article tries to provide an accurate review of the time and interpretation of the subject of rapid study.
We'll discuss the basic ecosystems, ecology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and the prevention of disease.
Even though we still have many unanswered questions, we still hope that this survey will help us to understand the threatening effects of the disease.
The Winter Festival on January 25, 2020 has been a memory that has never happened and forgotten for all Chinese people who were instructed to stay at home for vacation and a few weeks after the epidemic of new virus.
This virus is particularly gayloged with a coronaryl (CoV) that caused severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; so, this virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease caused by the CVsease (COLD).
The academy started at Atta, Chinese, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Until March 2, 2020, this virus has caused 80,000 cases of COVID, with more than 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died of the world.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the enemy of a judge number 1" and potentially spoils more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (ptts://www.c.nnnánm.h.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7 2020 that set out virus Davidics isolated from some patients, more than 200 patients have been published about COVID, which include virologists, milologists, emologists, and treatments.
This is trying to include research progress in this fast - growing field of subjects.
As possible, we'll try to compare our COVID 19th with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, or Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, plague in 2012).
We will also consider what has been learned so far about preventing disease and other questions that have not been answered but urgency.
Based on tradition, CV is considered nonletal pathogens for humans, especially causing about 15% pills 4.
Even so, in this century, we have encountered a CV that is very reliable for humans twice, that is, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and Saudi in 2012, and it spread to many other countries with deadly morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the COVID19 is the third CoV plague in recorded human history.
As shown in the Gbr.1, the pneumonnonic called the first unknown of the Watis on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of Chinese citizens.
Seven days later, the CV desens launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Whato was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, health - care infection was reported, showing that human transmissions may occur.
On January 23, the region was quarantined in the city of Whato and the entire public transport was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinis study of this disease reported that, of 41 patients with a confirmed case, only 21 patients are directly involved with Wpatos food markets considered to be the first location of an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO revealed this epidemic as a global health emergency.
When this report was written, the disease had spread across the whole Chinese country and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Gbr.2).
Because of the developing situation very quickly, the end of the plague and the effect of the outbreak must still be set.
On February 11, 2020, multipusat studies at 8,866 patients, which include 4.021 FOVID patients confirmed, present the following description of the epidemic (splamp.weix.q.q.com/s/UlBi-HPHXSHHHHyHHHHybA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Almost half (47, from those infected over 50 years old, only a few are under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected people under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0,31/100,000) than women (0,27/100,000).
COVID19 is widely widely known in the clarster, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID19 takes an average 5-9) day from awit to diagnosis.
The average immuration period is 4.8 (3,0-7,2) days.
The average time starts from awitan to death is 9.5 (48-13) days.
Base chronology (R0) is 3,77 (95% CI: 3,51-405) and R0 is reduced 2.23-482.
The number of infected people increased in expositively before 23 Jan. 2020, according to the time when the mamani Olympic Festival was in China.
The patient's Mortality with a confirmed case at 2.44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%) and mortality is reduced to all patients by 3.6% CI: 2,02-5,541.
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 is sex, age (060 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CV is a large subScient virus gather that contains a single Rinsense entry.
CV can be divided into four genuss, my alfa, megam, and delta, with alfa-and-ta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glioprotein tons of entertainmentlan or cheater (S) set the cover of the cell reception, enzymes of the angiotensinus 2 (ACE 2) and repided pecide 4 (DoP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERV-CoV, then the membrane occurs.
Genom RNA virus is released into the stoplasm; after the transmission of the virus, geneoms are associated with glyceptain cover and protein compounds form anvesel containing virison, which then suffers from the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 genens are first reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new mal-CoV character with more than 99.98% of 10 samples involved; the sample was taken from the location of the outbreak, which is the Johnan Sea food market in the West.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV compared with MERS-CoV.
Through the electrons transmission, the SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the very thin part of the human-silium hymicist cycle.
ACE2 humans were found a prescription for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Even so, the SARS-CoV-2 protein relates to human ACE2 is weaker than their ties with SARS-CoV protein, which is according to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not as strong as SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein that is attached to orf3b and proteins that are extracted with an orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may be involved in virus pathogenism and IFN%% expression; but, orf8 has no known domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, it reported cryo-EM ACE2 human structure on a 2.9 human resolution in complex complex with amino B0AT1 acid.
They found that complex, which has a closed, closed agreement, set up the form of the ACE2-B0AT1 complex, can bind two protein S, which is evidence of identification and CV infection.
B0AT1 can be set for a flat target in a drug filter to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each one has been supplied to humans through bosang and camels.
Using an comparison by the SARS-CoV-2 comparison with another CVV, bats are considered the original SARS-CoV-2 image because the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs similar-SARS from a bat called bt-SL-CVXX45 and b-L-CVVVVX1.
However, the extender who helped the virus cross species barrier to infecting humans is still unknown, and transmission routes must still be explained.
Ji, et al. proposes snakes as bear viruses from bats to humans who involve homologic recombination in protein S.
According to one study, researcher in Guangzhou, Chinese Chinese, proposed that the tow, the long - standing mammal of ants used often in traditional Chinese drug drugs, potentially as a SARS-CoV-2 based on the decodious demology of CV found in the farcept and SARS-CV-VV.
Even so, 1% of the difference that is spread throughout the genom is still a big difference; for that, a decided result has not yet been obtained.
Physical nature is SARS-CoV-2 not quite familiar.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days on 20 °C and light 40%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar qualities.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat on 56 °C for 30 minutes; etanol 75%, ecleticts containing chlorine acid, modatic acid, chlorform, and other fat intake, but not corxexins, effectively Although.
In general, the whole human population has no regard for SARS-CoV-2 and because it's vulnerable to this new virus.
Right now, there are no detailed studies reporting on immunology response to the SARS-CoV-2 response.
Therefore, we can only refer to another CoV study before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4)4).
In general, after unincinciationing, the virus is known by the default immune system through pattern recognition (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-lepecer, Toll-leptor (TLR), NOD-LARR), and GIG-RIRIRIR (CR).
Through a different line, the virus supports the inflineal factor expression, indritic development of cell cells, and interferon type I (IFN) that limits the spread of the virus and speeds anti-orggotosis by mrag virus.
However, protein N on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune reactions.
Not long afterward, an immune response joined in fighting against this virus.
Limfotes T, which includes CD4+ cells and CD8+, play an important role in this defense.
T CD4+ cell installs B cells to produce specific antibodi against the virus, and T CD8+ cells kill cells that are directly infected.
The T helper cell produces stokin proinflemori to help protect cells.
However, CV can interfere with T cells by exposing cell apoposis T.
The sense of humor, which includes implementment, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodi is also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, the antibodi that is isolated from a patient who has been cured neutrally MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reaction produces a large amount of locally free radicals, which can cause severe damage in the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, failure of aging and even death organs.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is marked by awitn, more about the elderly with the cure and pregnant women.
In general, people who are exposed to viruses in large numbers or whose immune functions are disturbed have a higher chance than others.
The love of average SARS-CoV-2 period is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on a study of 425 cases in the West.
However, a study of 1.099 cases shows that the average period is 3 days and is about to start from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as explained above, show that the immiracy period is 4.8 (3,0-7,2) days based on 8.866 cases.
It is vital that health authorities adjust regular quarantine time based on the most accurate period of inquibcy so that prevent people from infected, but without symptoms, filtering a virus to others.
As general practice, people who are exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Must the time of quarantine be extended for 24 days?
Demms are often major and early COVID symptoms, with or without other symptoms such as dry, sweat, muscle, muscle pain, stomach pain, kidney pain, kidney pain, chest pain, nausa, nausa, and vomit.
Some patients were exposed and/or hipoxemia a week after the awitan disease.
In a severe case, the development of patient disease goes on quickly into acute respiratory syndrome, severe shock, metaboicasis, and coagupathy.
The patient who suffers from fever and/or symptoms of respiratory and acute fever, even though without lung disorder, has to be covered with a virus for early diagnosis.
Sttudi demography at the end of December 20,19 shows that the percentage of symptoms over 98% for fever, 76% for dry coughs, 55% for disea, and 3% for rere; 8% patients need ventilator support.
Similar guests are reported in two recent studies, which are studied at family and lootsters who are influenced by the transmission of the amimmatics.
As opposed to that, the study demography in 2012 shows that the MERS-CoV patient also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and was suspended (55%) as a major symptoms.
However, 80% patients need the support of ventilation, much more than COVID patients and are consistent with the higher MERS correction than COVID-19.
Dire (26%) and throat pain (21%) also killed MERS patients.
In the SARS patient, fever (99%-100%), dry rock is 9,0%%%), disea (40%), dire (20-25%), and throat disease (13-25%) as a major symptoms and support of ventilation are needed for about 14 percent of patients.
Until February 14th, COVID mortality was 2% by a confirmed case reached 66.576 worldwide.
As far as that is, SARS mortality in November 2002 was confirmed by 10% of 8.096 cases.
For MERS, based on demography studies on June 2012, death at 37% of 2.494 confirmed cases.
Sttudi before reporting that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reaches the height of 6,47 with a total of trust (CI) 95% at 5.7-7,23, while R0 SARS-CoV is only measured by 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given at Table 1.
These numbers show that SARS-CoV-2 has higher ability of spreading power than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it's not as close as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 academy is greater than the MERS-CoV academy and SARS-CoV.
Most often found in one family or from one group or a vehicle like a cruise ship.
Patients often have travel history or live in the West or some other scaffold or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the Awitan.
It has been reported, however, that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms of more than two weeks and patients returning from the hospital can bring the virus again, thus causing caution to increase quarantine time.
At the beginning, patients have a count of the white blood cells of the perusifer.
For example, limfoupia by counting white blood cells < 4×109/L, which include sc.1×9/L, and amnomopase levels and increased viremia found at 1.099 FLOVID) patients.
The unit of enzymes and muscles and moglobin increased in the blood of a number of patients, as well as a C-reactive protein and blood rate increases in most patients.
In patients with heavy cases, D-dimer rate increased, that is, the product of fibrin's dressing products that are in the blood, and the calphoctes are down dramatically.
The presence of photo torrupors was found in large  COVID patients and marked with a synaptial shadow or a grancity in the lungs.
Patients often have a pneumia aot, acute lung injury, and acute memory syndrome (ARDS).
When RADS is happening, inflamation instructating, I'm sorting fluids, and progressive fibrosis is very exciting to the exchange of gas.
The pneumocytes type I type and the type I type... lowers southernphactant levels and increase surface pressure so that lowers the capacity of the lungs to expand and increase the risk of lungs.
Therefore, the worst index in the bactus photo is often parallel to the worst rate of disease.
On February 18, 2020, first - century pneumocytes studies show pneumocytes, formed hyacinic membrane, and intertrocytes, as well as cynic cells in many patients who died from this disease, according to pathological pathology and ADS and similar analysis for patients and MSARS.
The SARS-CoV-2 RSD-2 Detection by the reaction of the polymerase transcrupase chain (RT-PRR) was used as the leading criteria for COVID 19th diagnosis.
But because of a high degree of false negative, which can speed up the epidemic, linis ’ diagnosis begins to be used for diagnosis (no more just relying on RRT-PRR) in China on February 13, 2020.
Similar situations also occur on SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination between the history of disease, chinis, lab tests, and radiological findings is very important and a necessity to make effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Ferng talk groups set out SEROCK technique protocols based-CICPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected RARS VARS-CoV-2 scitricat on 20-18 ml/L-L-L practices to 200-18 ml-L-100 copies of micro-L-L-L-L-L-L2, using a microput in less-troptroductroptroptiles in a time-tres in less than one hour.
After all, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if verified on a clinis sample.
Because of the lack of experience with the new CV, doctors especially offer support to CVID patients, while trying various therapies that were used or previously used for other CoV care, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral disease (Table.2).
This type of therapy is present and potential therapy with addictive medicine, immunosoppressant, bloodoids, plasma from a developing patient, traditional Chinese drug, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of a patient who has been cured to be used in therapy.
Formation companies develop antibodi and vaccines against this virus.
At the beginning stage, SARS-CoV-2 especially attacked the lungs and may also attack another organ that exposes the ACE2 in lower levels, such as the gastrinll and kidney system.
Yet, surgery and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and the cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is vital to ease symptoms and saving lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high - flow oxygen, non-corruptitive ventilation, and mechanical ventilation, depending on the risk of disease.
The patient with a severe respiratory symptoms must be supported with extra ecororopeum oxygen (ECMM), which is a modifiedly modified quate technique used for heart failure or respiratory disease that threatens the soul.
In addition, electrolit balance care, prevention and secondary infection care, and vital organ function protection is also vital for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
An excessive immune system reaction is known to cause a stokin storm to the SARS and MERS patients.
The stokin storm is the form of systemantology response that marked the degs of a series of stokins, which include TNF 1958, LI-2, LI-6, IFN give births, IFN give you one, and MP-1.
These stokin-stocks have been able to release a large number of free radicals that became the main cause of RADS and failed majemunk organ.
Imunosupression is very important in the care of the stokin storm, especially to severe patients.
Komicosteroid and Tocilizab, an anti-Il6 anti-LI6 anti-LI6 anti-condemeroid anti-compression, has been used to handle the katokin storm.
Other imunosupressors for a storm of stokin include immun response modules directed by T cells; IFN-BN, LO-1, and TNF; ihibisibision JA; blintomab; filter signal ctokin 4; and the InhitordaC.
Steroids, as immunnosupression, are used in the SARS care to reduce the severity of inflemiaology damage.
However, steroids on high doses are useless for severe lung injury on SARS patients and COVID-19.
On the other hand, steroids can cause severe side effects, especially Orientals, which are highly influenced by prognosis.
However, a brief correcosteroid gift on low doses until it's being recommended to be given carefully with critical COVID patients.
At this writing, there was not yet effective alternative therapy confirmed.
However, reserdivitrically intraventa, which is a nucleus disorder, is built on an American COVIDD patient.
Redesivir is a new drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of disease caused by the nervous virus and the Marlburg virus.
Later, remoteadesivir also showed inhibitation against another single untaki virus, which includes the MERS virus and the SARS.
Based on this, Gilead provided this compound for Chinese Chinese to do a series of tests on the SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and it's very close.
In addition, sweeping the carintinb, interferon- cantidadon, will spinvir/navir, and aboverin has been advised to be the potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diare, nauseas, vomits, liver damage, and other reaction may occur after combination therapy with spinavir/navir.
This therapy is related to another drug that patients use must be carefully monitored.
Plasma of the patient who has been cured and created antibodi
There's a long history of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who suffer the same disease or to prevent the disease.
Indeed, recovery patients often have relatively high antibodi levels in his blood.
Antibodi is immunoglobin (Ig) produced limphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign items, recognize unique molecules on pathogens, and directly neutral them.
Based on this, plasma is gathered from the blood of a group of patients who have been cured of COVID and enrolled to 10 severe patients.
Their symptoms are improved in 24 hours, along with a drop of intestinal and virus weight and increased the amount of oxygen in the blood.
However, proof and clarification need to be done to offer such methods for a large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
In addition to the effects of the supples, some of the shortage associated with plasma must be considered carefully.
For example, antibods can minimize imun reactions and cause stokin syndrome, which is potentially threatening behavior.
An antibodi concentration in blood is usually low and plasma is required in a large amount of care for critical patients.
The development and production of antibodi are specificly fast enough to fight global epidemics hard to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from the patient who are cured and identify genetic code that is effective in antibodi or to make effective antibodistsal filters on proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibodi production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of components in formulas, the formula is different according to the diagnosis based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or obscure because they are hard to extract or verify the components or the digital combination.
Right now, because effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 has not yet been present, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms until it is present or for people who recover from heavy diseases.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Wen is found straight for COVID-19 therapy.
The top level of recovery in COVID medical therapy is dead in some Chinese province using TCM on 8lucts, including Gansu (63,9%), Nixia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei province, used only about 30% of TCVIVOD, has the lowest level (13%).
However, this comparison is still very violent because many other effects, such as the amount and severity of patients, have to be included in evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Bli Zhang and friends made a study that compared West drug therapy (WM) only with WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time needed to heal the body temperature, lost symptoms, and it was very briefer to the WM+TCM group than the WM only.
More impressively, symptoms (from light to heavy) are much less for WM+TCM groups than the WM groups (7,4%) and mortality is lower in WM+CM groups than the WM group only (8%).
Even so, effective and security TCM is still waiting for a trials that are controlled better on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the working mechanism and clarify effective components in TCM therapy or combination, if possible.
Most patients who were expected or confirmed by COVID were extremely afraid of these highly contagious diseases and even deadly diseases, and people who were quarantined also feel ill, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hyperxia, and side effects as immunia are caused by multiple mental anxiety and stress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of pharmic characteristics, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotors, psychotic symptoms, deiriums, and even suicides have been reported.
The presence of contact and quarantine is mandatory, as part of public health response to the COVID epidemic, can make people feel more anxious and guilty about the effects of vascular, quarantine, and igma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided for the COVID, the expected patient, and the people who are involved with them, and the general people who need it.
Physic support must include forming a multi-discipline mental health team, clear communication with a routine and accurate update on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapy plans and devices and professional electronic apps to avoid contact close to each other.
Effective Vakins are essential to mixing chain chain of transmissions from animal reservoirs and humans infected to vulnerable insulations that are often administered in the control of the outbreak caused by the virus.
Efforts have been done to develop a protein-based protein - based vaccine S, which is long-term and effective in making neutral antibiotics and/or immunity that protects SARS-CoV.
For SARS, living vaccines have been assessed on experiment animals.
Even so, effective in this vaccine’s vivo candidate at old age and model challenges and protection against the zonotic virus infection must still be determined before the treatment starts.
It's probably because SARS dropped 17 years ago and no new cases were reported since then.
On the other hand, Ms. MERS's journal continues to occur in the Middle East and spread to another area because there is also the source of the zootics in the academy area.
The vaccine has been developed for the MERS by using the disabled virus, the DNA plasmid, the virus sensors, the particles similar to viruses, and a unit of recomputies, and some of them have been assessed for experiments.
The vaccine development on SARS-CoV-2 is safe and effective for non-imun people is a very urgent and vital task to control the current epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to overcome because it's a long time to develop vaccines and dynamic variations of CoV.
As a new disease, the COVID-19 has just begun to show a full-collic trip to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to ease their recovery without full schedule.
However, it is similar with SARS and MERS, COVID19 is also associated with a high birthrate and mortality in patients with heavy cases.
Thus, the development of prognosisics is essential for health care to ensure the service, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on this so - reported clinis study, the following factors can be affected or associated with CVIDS patients (CDD):
Age: The age is the most important factor for SARS prognos, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID19 is especially true at 30-65 years of age with 47, over 50 years of age patients in a study of 8.866 cases as explained above.
The patient who needs intensive treatment tends to have a prognosticity and complications and significantly older than patients who do not need intensive treatment (age 66 years), which defines age as a prognostic factor for the final results of COVID5 patients.
Type: SARS-CoV-2 more infects men than women (0,31/100,000 than 0.77/100,000), as explained above.
Asrbidity and complications: A COVID patients who need intensive care are likely more likely to suffer acute heart injury and arrimemia.
Heart story also has a major reason for death on SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 reportedly can also be passed on to colliocytes with ACE2-positives, which can lead to a heart service on COLDian patients.
It should be noted that advanced age and fundamental illness are highly linked and can affect one another.
Abnormal lab: C-reactive protein cycle (CRP) in blood reflects immunity or network injury and is pursued as a potential factor for disease, response to therapy, and recovery of end.
The corruption between the CRP levels and the enlightenment and the COVIDS has also been pursued.
In addition, the increase in lmatate dehygenase (LDH), aspartat imnoase (ASTT), amin iminocase (ALT), and creating the birthtin (CCC) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in hearts and hearts, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, this enzyme-enzim is a traditional signature to be enabled by heart and heart.
Main clinical symptoms: Photos and development of temporary chemistry must be considered together with other things to predict the final results and implementing COVID 19th.
Linoid use: As explained above, steroids are a lot of incompression in terms of treatment for infection therapy therapy in order to reduce the spread of inflemiology.
Because high doseic high - tech cornetoids are used to severe SARS patients, many who survive from this disease end up suffering from anastroicasis avacium with a life-implicity and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, asteroid must be used on low doses and a brief period of time for the COVIDian patient.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the 19th century, many patients suffer extraordinary stress because they have to go through long - term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and other patients.
The psychological treatment and long - term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on the demography study so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different image of epidemicology than the SARS.
In addition to complications in the lower respiratory channel, SARS-CoV-2 can be efficiently applied on the above respiratory channels and cause light symptoms or no symptoms in early stages of infection, similar to other CVs that cause pills.
Therefore, at the early phase or time of inflation, infected patients can produce viruses during everyday activities, which cause great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, the SARS-CoV transmission occurred when the patient was seriously ill and most did not occur at the beginning of the phase.
In this way, the COVIDS epidemic is much worse and difficult to contain than the SARS plague.
Right now, great effort is being done in China, which includes quarantine of the West and cities around and more of the population with the hope of deleting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this action is very damaging economics and other sectors in the country, new patients have dropped, which indicate epidemic delay.
The most optimistic expectation of the epidemic will end in March and the fall phase last for 3 to4 months.
However, some other experts are not as involved.
Paul Hunter's al. Respected that COVID-19, which seems to be much more contagious than SARS, won't end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made models to predict the end of the epidemic and states that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of global population.
The Canadian researcher group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-conka and the brain of patients who had been cured and returned home from the hospital two weeks earlier.
Even so, promising signs happen in Chinese, if seen by the decline of the number of new cases, which shows that the strategy right now might work.
The ball is reprodicated will cause a million cases with half deaths as well.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, this disease can eventually be controlled.
Perhaps, as well as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens his ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus not too much pathogen that can be compatible with humans.
The comparison of the COVID epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic was given below (Gbr. 5)
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transced through rock or ink, and it may also be through direct contact with the virus contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the fetus so that it was possible for new transmissions, which are transmissions of faith-to-mouths.
Recent studies on 138 cases report that 41% cases may be caused by corcomiial infections, which include 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health - care providers.
Therefore, proper precautions must be done to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who happen to be infected with patients or infected.
First defense line that can be used to reduce infection risks is through the use of maskers, both surgical masks and masks of N95 respirator N95 (count number 1860-an) to help control the virus.
The surgeon’s condition is to keep a spark of infected people from being exposed or attached to the surface of the material, where the spray can be passed on to others.
However, only masks of N95 ( 1860-an series) that can protect against viriional inquision in size at least 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can completely redecorate; SARS-CoV is similar to SARS-CoV in size, both about 85m.
Because particles can redemploy even five surgical masks that are bent into one, direct health care providers with patients have to wear N95 (count number 1860-an) and not maserickers.
Besides masks, health care providers need to wear suitable accommodations to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a physician infected SARS-CoV-2, even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus might get into his body through the eyebite.
Therefore, health care providers must also wear facial shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the public community in peace - friendly or potential areas, it is recommended for everyone to wash his hands with soap more often than usual, to stay at home for self - denial, and to avoid contact with those who are infected.
Three legs are believed to be appropriate to keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce infection and prevent the virus’s spread.
Even though SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high wise homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must be a big warning for Chinese who had strong memories of the SARS plague of 2003.
Even so, on January 19, 2020, director of the Crime Center Peaceed People by saying that this new virus had the limited quality of human preaching and reproductive capacity of human beings and precautions and the cure of the disease is not a problem.
This message is very soothing to the fear of society, especially when the entire country is preparing for Semani Night Festival, so this critical time is missing to keep a small, small, chronic term of disease in Ocean.
The body of disease in Chinese should learn from this and make great improvement in the future.
For example, this body should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because each word is noted by its inhabitants and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and effective information from the clinic than waiting for an official report from doctors or authorities; (3) restricting the potential infection in the early stages, and not trying to calm the public; and (4) put out more effective and increasing public awareness of the spread of the epidemic and the public’s response.
The COVID-19 virus was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started to spread on December 20,19.
In less than two months, the plague has spread across all Chinas and over 50 countries in the world at this writing.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and COVID's symptoms and SARS as well, the COVIDS epidemic has an impact like the SARS's epidemic returned.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to scan the epidemic and handle patients.
THE 19th century is much more about older than young people and more about men than women, and the rate of death is higher than young people.
SARS Mortality is higher than SARS's mortal death of COVID (10,91% more than 1.4%).
COVID patients have a virus during their absence of symptoms, while SARS patients usually have a virus during their severe illness, making it more difficult to enter the COVID original ministry than the SARS.
It explains some of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
A routine line line to check SARS-CoV-2 can provide negative results on some COVID patients.
On the other hand, patient who has been cured can give positive results in a viral examination.
This has greatly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
With such rapid progress in COVID-19 study, some of the important problems still have to be solved, which is:
Where is SARS-CoV-2 from?
Although genetic wises are found at 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs similar-SARS bats, we still have no idea that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal is the species of walking through the virus from the original audience, say bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we can't launch transmission effectively and plague can spread over all the time.
Even though moleculardels and biokimia solves that SARS-CoV-2 relates to ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the spirit cell and lead to the next pathology change?
Is this virus also compatible with cells that express the ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot reach fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How did the virus develop geneticly during transmission between humans?
Will this academy be the entire world's academy, end up like the SARS, or repeats again with a flu?
The answer to questions above and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
Even so, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
The human crown virus is the foundation of thezonotic virus
For thousands of years, navigation and adaptability have moved co-enerving the crown virus (CoV) and its excitement, including humans.
Before 2003, two CVs (HCV) were known to cause light disease, such as the cold.
The cycle of heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome reverses conditions and reveals how HCV infection can be very destructive and threatening.
The SARS-CoV-2 image in central China at the end of 2019 has made CVs back and surprised us with high transmissions, but with higher pathogens than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCV infection is a zoononosis.
Most HCVs are from the bat in this animal, the virus is not a pathogen.
Some HCV participants have been known as well.
Animal alert identification has direct implications in the prevention of human disease.
CoV-inang communication information on animals can also provide important insights about CoV pathogens on humans.
In this review, we present the general description of knowledge today about seven HCV, focusing on its discovery and its origin and its internotic transmission.
What's important is that we compare and turn the HCV from the point of evolution and parmation.
CV 2019 (COVID) period currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the successful immotion terms and implications of the virus evolution are also challenged.
The crown virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, made up of a group of rare RNNA virus, positive givingarra, and single - set.
This virus has the largest genom of 26 to 20 kilos of water between the RNA virus called "CoV", because it's like a crown under the electron microscope.
Based on the structure, CV has a genom that has no equal fatigue.
About two thirds of genem consisted of two large open - read orders (ORF1bs) that are held together. Both of them are extracted into polyprotein rep1a and pp1abs.
Poliprotein has more processing to form 16 nontructure proteins, called nsp1~16.
The genom bed consists of ordered open read (ORF) for structure proteins, which include tons of corn or cheat (S), veil or evelope (M), membrane (M), and ruleprotein (N).
A number of selected proteins for a specific line of descent are also administered by a variety of CV genes.
Based on the difference in protein dryens, CV is classified to four genuss (alfa-CoV, m-CoV, mega-CoV, and delta-CoV); among those four genus, I-CoV has the most HCV and is divided into four interlines (A, C, C, and D).
Evidence suggests that bats and animals are gene sources for most of the alfa-CoV and Me-CoV, while aggas are the main algams-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CV has constantly crossed the barrier of species and some CV has become an important pathogen to humans.
Until now, there are seven human CoVs (HCV) known.
Among the seven of the virus, HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alfa-CoV.
Five of them covered HCV-OC43, HCV-HIT, heavy - respiratory virus (SARS-CoV), Middle-CD syndrome virus.
HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HITOT, and HCV-NL63 is usually cause mild symptoms, such as pills and/or here.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-CoV-2 is highly togenic, causing serious respiratory infections in relatively more patients and has more opportunities to grow into a quate disease syndrome (ARDS) and show outside the lung organ.
HCV-229E's first strategy, B814, is isolated from patients who were cold in the middle of 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through a deep study of HCV-29E and HCV-OC43, which is both leading to a healing symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCV infection is largely harmless, until the SARS epidemic is over.
The SARS plague that happened in 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreak in current history, which infects more than 8,000 people with violent numbers of deaths about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a continued epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with the preaching of the good news worldwide.
HCV just 20199-nCoV), which is next called SARS-CoV-2, is an quate agent of the coronary virus 2019 (COVID-19), who has taken lives over 3,120 and infected more people from 91,000 people to March 3,20.
Alarm's already said and the world must prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 academy to come.
The seven HCVs all have the origin of the zootics of bats, mice, or pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of evolution of all HCV from the bat. On the bat, CV was good and nonpatogenized, but showed great genetic diversity.
The COVID fundamental academy has led to medical, scientific, social, and tremendous moral challenges for Chinese and the entire world.
The origin of the HCV zonotic zonotics gave the shell to understand natural history, driver’s power, and the potential factor for moving between species.
It can also drive or facilitate the search for reservoir animals, mediators, and SARS-CoV-2, which have important implications in the future preaching precautions.
In this review, we gave the general description of the origin of the zoonotic, internotic transmission, and HCoV pathogens.
We particularly focused on and discussed the general topic that HCV's parent virus is usually nonpatogenic in its natural reservoir, but became a pathogen after transmission to a new host.
We also discussed the trend in HCV evolution that transmission skills are often accompanied by a decline in pathogenity.
The final result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before HCVolation 292 B814 is the first of the patients who were exposed to colds, various CVs have been isolated from the infected animals, which include turkey, beef, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few schools, seven HCV has been identified.
A brief HCV history history in chronology sequence (Tbel 1) is an informative clue.
The HCV-229E strategy is isolated from the patient's breathing channels that are exposed to the overs of breathing infections in 1966, which are later adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cells.
HCV-229E patients show flum symptoms, which include headaches, headaches, aches, and throat pains, along with fever and rock visible at 10~20% of cases.
Next in 1967, HCV-OC43 was isolated from organ curding and sequenced series across the still diluted brain.
The description of HCV-OC43 infection seems to be similar to an infection caused by HCV-29E, which is in a simtomaticly opposed to other respiratory pathogen infections like A and rhinorus virus.
HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 spread across the world and tends to be the most isolated winter in the middle of the world.
Usually, these two viruses are less than a week and followed by a sick period of about two weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, a healthy person infected HCV-29E has had a light flu.
Only a few patients with weak body immune coils showing a heavy respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as "pneumon antipia", is a pandemia because of the first HCV to be well documented in human history and its elective agents are SARS-CoV, which is the third HCV found.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangong Province, China.
The SARS academy led to 8.096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spread in many countries and continents.
In spite of the superberrators, each case is expected to cause about two secondary cases, with a 4 to 7 days and the top of the virus load is seen on the 10th day of disease.
SARS-CoV patients are beginning to have nogies, headaches, fevers, fatigues, and fatigues, followed by diseas, coughs, and respiratory disorder as further symptoms.
Limfopenia, an unusual heart function test, and the development of birthin was an ordinary lab disorder in SARS.
The damage to alveolar's possession, the epitel cells enhancement, and macrofag changes are also observed to SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% patients need intensive care and mechanical vent.
In addition to the lower respiratory channels, some organs that include electrical, heart, and kidney control can also be infected in heavy cases, usually accompanied by stokin storms, which can be deadly, especially on patients that are weak.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung bioption of zero patients who traveled to Hong Kong of Guangzhou.
Since then, great effort has been dedicated for HCV research.
HCV-NL63 is isolated from a 7-year-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus is at first very common with children, the elderly, and the immune patient who suffers from respiratory disease.
Comriza description, carbon dioxide, fever, and bronics are common found in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent scholar explains the same immune system of nassal boy eight months of Pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually spreading around the world.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 represents about 4.3 respiratory disease and the peak of events occurred in the early summer, spring, and winter.
HCV-NL63 is linked to crutructructative escape, which is also called crude.
In the same year, HCV-HOCO1 is isolated from a 71-year-old man who was treated in favor of pneumonia and bronicist in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronicist, HCV-HITO1 reportedly related to acute asthma emissions.
Mountpa with HCV-NL63, HC229E, and HCV-OC43, HCOV-HAR1 found all over the world, causing light breathing disease.
The entire HCV community has been adapted to human beings and generally has a very small risk of retroducated disease, even though incredible cases are happening because unknown reason, such as the HCV-NLL3 subtype case is reportedly more than recently leading to a massive drug infection in a drug.
In general, when it comes to being able to move efficient and continue to defend itself within humans, the atmosphere and the HCV pathity are also diminished.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from 60-year-old patients who had pneumon mut and failed kidney in Saudi Arabia.
Even though most of the lab claims have come from the Middle East, useful cases with regular secondary preaching to close contacts have been reported in various European and Tnisia countries.
The other secondary plague occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 1,86 confirmed cases.
MERS's quainsity is similar to that of SARS clinis, which is characterized by pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also suffered acute kidney failure, which only happened to the MERS between the disease caused by HCV.
Over 30% patients show gastaintol symptoms, like here and vomit.
Up to February 14, 2020, more than 2500 lab confirmed cases were reported on by the death of a high case, which was by 34,4%, making MERS-CoV into one of the most terrifying viruses known by humans.
In the middle to the end of December 20,19, the professor of pneumonian patients who are naturally remodervatively associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection found in the West, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the outbreak of the current respiratory cycle infection and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as global Health Committee and named it COVID-19.
Until March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed around the world, with a number of rough cases within 3.4%.
It must be noted, the death of a case in Hubei, Chinese, 4.2%, while the death of a case outside Hubei is 12%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with images of fever, cough, and breathing.
He's also found on a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly grow into acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are much similar to that of a high hymology of bleotide sequence, of 82%, they're in different branches.
The SARS-CoV-2 government is obviously lower, but more contagious than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported and may have played a role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the world.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCV shows the equation and the very interesting differences.
First of all, the immuration and duration of HCV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows another six HCV trend.
Secondly, the COVID 19thness is between SARS-CoV and four other HCV communities (KCV29E, HCV-OC43, HCOV-HOCTO1), and HCV-HITOV-LOV-LOV-LO3).
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common image in HCV communities infection, which includes the description of light nonspective symptoms or even symptoms.
On the other hand, a very severe COVID case can be seen like a SARS-CoV infection even with a little lower ratio.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows an interesting pattern characteristic, has a delay with HCV communities and SARS-CoV communities.
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission skills are at least as high as HCV community.
On the other hand, losing the SARS-CoV-2 transmission skills after some trail on humans still need to be verified, as the SARS-CoV case and MERS-CoV.
Last, just like another HCV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the dases sample.
"Is the SARS-CoV-CoVal transmission important, as in the case of the SARS-CoV transmission case, at least in certain situations, that must still be verified by the next study."
It's also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is a season like the HCV community case.
In any case, the SARS-CoV-2 description, which includes transmission skills, pathogens, and continued preaching in some of the paths on humans, will have a powerful effect on the end of the current COVID epidemic.
Four HCV communities that cause light symptoms have all adapted to humans.
Seeing from another point of view, humans can be said to have adapted to these four HCVs.
In other words, both HCV and humans may be a species of attempting HCV marketing species.
The HCV that causes man and man who are suffering from severe HCV has been destroyed.
In order for this to happen, HCV has to apply in humans in a sufficient amount to allow me to ammutize adaptive mupation to fight insulation factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 plague survives and more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to adapt fully to humans.
If the virus is properly adapted, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or the steps of any other infection control.
All these years, four CV communities went through human population and triggered colds on people who are incomcompetent.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoirs.
Instead, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs that are very reliable with humans and their transmissions in humans cannot be maintained.
Both have to defend themselves and do self-processervotic reservoirs and seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or a few Elishas and proofors.
SARS-CoV-2 has a picture similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is so easy to experiment like HCV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCV community and not as sepatogenik SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It must still be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt fully to humans and build up in humans without a reservair or a walking animal.
Before discussing the origin of HCV animals, we need to discuss definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, nature, reservoirs, cobs, and HCV's explification.
Animals act as HCV's evolutionary safe if they have a close - knit ancestor and share high homology at the high levels of bleleotida.
The ancestor virus usually adapts well and is nonpatogenic in this host.
Similarly, reservoir greeting carries HCV through and over a long period of time.
In these two cases, naturally infected peace and is a natural improvement for HCV or the mother virus.
On the other hand, if HCV just went into the window right before or about the time the virus gets into man, the virus has not been adapted to a new host and often used to pathogens.
This extender can function as a source of human infection and play as an amplifying greeting by allowing the virus to apply for a while, and then exposing it to humans to the damage of human infection.
HCV can experience a dead infection if it can't keep its transmission in the mail.
On the other hand, HCV can also be adapted to extendment and even cause long - term endlessness.
In this case, the experienced swimmer is a natural reservoir.
The epidemic data reveals automatically that the zero SARS case has contact history with the hunting animals.
The further perprevalation study indicates that the animal seller has an anti-SARS-CoV preenederate pretententation rate with the general population.
The moon-SARS-CoV virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV with SARS-CoS-CoS-CoV.
In short, this is supported by the fact that there have been no more SARS cases reported since all the develop in the market was killed.
Even so, it is reported that the moon's poor nature or farms to the living animals market give most of the negative results for SARS-CoV. It shows that the moon's probably just acting as an acifillation attendant, but it's not the natural SARS-CoV-CV.
It is necessary to be noted, because 80% of the various animals at the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV anti-CoV anti-CV anti-C, cannot be added that many species of small mammals may also function as a SARS-CoV driver’s examination.
All this host seems to be SARS-CoV's final reminder.
The search of natural animals for SARS-CoV next revealed a nearby CV bat, called CV bat bat bat bat Rhlopus relatives of HARSHI3 (SARSr-Rh-Rh-BatCoCO3), which is found in the Chinese horsebes.
This experiment provides a positive test for anti-SARS-CoV anti-CV anti-CV anti-CARSr-Rh-BatCoV HI3 anti-CO3 anti-D.
This CV and the CV bat share other homology descodios at 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This team is the foundation for a new concept that bats are immune to new human pathogens.
Some CoVs are similar-SARS (SL-CoV) as well as identified from bats, but only one, which is named WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The dym reversing Drysin 2 (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV reception.
The WIV1 that comes from the sample of bat - quains ’ quainciples shown using ACE2 bats, musang, and humans as reception to enter into cells.
Interesting thing, SARS patients convaleen can neutral WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the most near the SARS-CoV ancestors at bat, with drymsicototide homies at about 95%.
In spite of the height of the homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus immediately.
Analysthetics group MERS-CoV into the same group as CV-HAR4 bats and CoV-HI5 bats.
CoV-HI4 bat and MERS-CoV uses the same alert receiver, which is a 4 papididididid (DoPP4), as a path into the virus.
A polymerase RNA depends on MERS-CoV's RS-CoVs more closely than on its own at the mal-CoV bat identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no MERS-CoV is found alive in the wild bat.
MERS-CoV and his closest relatives CV-HIKO25 bat share only 87 million homs of bleleotide homs.
Therefore, the bat may not be the direct reservoir's direct MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the study of the Middle East shows that Arabic in some African countries has provided protective results for specific antibodis that maintain MERS-CoV, just as central Eastern camels.
MERS-CoV lives that are identical to the virus that is found in humans isolated from the use of Arabic instage ink. This indicates further that the camel is the actual reservoir greeting for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that the moreific virus bulletan with symptoms that are usually observed in a highly sensitive event that is infected with MERS-CoV.
It must be noted that an infected ink is not only through breathing routes but also through a peripheral route, which is also the main route of the bat virus.
Even so, the question is still not answered because many of the MERS cases confirmed have no contact history with the ink before the symptoms, the possibility of human transmission or unknown transmission route involving unknown species brought MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96,2% of akleotide homia with CV bat RTG13 that is isolated from Rhinolopcis affinis bat.
As in the SARS-CoV case and MERS-CoV, secular differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to set a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not be direct SARS-CoV-2 alert, except if CV bats were almost identical to being found in later days.
Likely, the SARS-CoV-2 animals are among the species sold and killed in the John's Merchants. Many early cases are related to this market, which indicate the possibility of any animal transmissions.
Some new studies based on metagenic desemia show that a small group of endangered mammals, known as milling trades, may also bring along the mal-CoV ancestors who're mixed with SARS-CoV-2.
Genom CoV developed this new grinder includes 85-92% of destrecootide sARS-CoV-2.
However, the CV is associated as close as that of RaTG13 in equal terms of 90% at the rate of ficleotide dryens.
Both of them were grouped into two subblines of viruslike SARS-CoV-2s in a three-mantic tree, one of which shared the reception domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with amno acid content content equivalent to 97,4%.
What's obvious, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much different, though the whole genom rate is higher.
Previously on this sick milling trend also reported contig virus detected from lung samples, which turned out to be mixed with SARS-CoV-2.
This quality adopts a different method of vacillations and manual curration to produce parian genoms made up of about 86,3% of the virus's complete.
We can't deny possible milling possible as one of the SARS-CoV-2 artists.
But now there is no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2's presence directly from the milling trade because of the French differences between SARS-CoV-2 and Me-KV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 grinding.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and I-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 human path at bat, milling, and other mammals still have to be set.
Even though the highest demologists on RBD were found between SARS-CoV-2 and I-KV-CARS-CoVS-CoVers, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homens at all levels of genom.
Too much to speculate if it is said that the high level of refrigeration between RBD-CoV relatives-CARS-CoVS-CoV2 developed and SARS-CoV-CoV-2 evolution has been moved by its decistationalized evolutionary evolution.
Hipoteesis is contesting the recombination between my co-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 go on milling and RaTG13 in third animal species.
As a factor of evolutionary driver, recombination happens a lot between my ass-CoV.
Researchers still can't decide the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to HCoV very pathogenic, the origin of the HCV-29E, HCV-OC43, HCL63, and HCL6V-HITO1 has also been copied.
Evidence suggests that HCV-NL63 and HCV-29E may be from CV bats, while HCV-OC43 parent virus and HCV-HITO1 have been found in a seavert.
It was reported that the CV bat named RACV.2 (Appaan Ridge CV) was detected at the bat three colours of North America show closeness with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E is geneticly associated with another CV bat, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKam/19/19/0, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also thought to be his assistant.
To be more clear, the current knowledge of HCV animals known in drawings 1 and Table 2.
Analysthetics have provided evidence of HCV transmission events in history.
In about 1890, when HCV-OC43 crossed species of cattle to infect humans, he was described as a respiratory infection.
HCV-29E transmission history is not too obvious.
The Alfa-CoV bat who's playing with HCV-29E has been found.
Between them, there's alfa-CoV alka.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, man, not alkasa, who might have joined the bat in an ecologic recologies together.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with the alkas.
Secondly, the alfa-CoV bat is benefiting with HCV-29E is a wide variety of and nonpatogenics in the bat, while alfa-CoVakasa caused respiratory disease plague on infected animals.
Last time, alfa-CoV alkasa was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of the alkasa getting alfa-CoV relatives-HCoV-29E of humans cannot be connected.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic virus, which includes rabies virus, elchi virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it's not so surprising that the bat might directly expose HCV-29E to man.
Another possibility, while alfa-CoV bat functions as a HCV-29E gene tag, alkas and Arabic camels may serve as middlesides to humans, just like the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is a very good example for transmission between the bat from the bat to the Arab camel and from the Arab ink to man.
The MERS-CoV era of the bat is known to identify the beginning of the virus and be fortified with the discovery after it.
Clearly, bats are rich species of viruses for the exchange between genetic fragments and inter-line transmissions.
Long age, a colony that is bound together, close social interactions, and strong flying skills, all are conditions that support bats to become the ideal virus.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the Arabic container for decades.
This virus has been adapted to a camel that has changed from the swimmer to a stable, natural reservoir greeting.
MERS-CoV causes a very light disease and maintains a relatively low rate in this animal.
The transmisspective transmission of man happens by chance and humans remain the end of the MIERS-CoV as the transmission can't continue.
Unlike the role of a camel in the MERS-CoV transmission, role of grinding, if there is, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission different.
Especially, I-CoV's mastrog size is very togenic in the milling season.
The milling may be the final thrill for my al-CoV-CoV-CoV-2 relatives, similar to mite in the SARS-CoV case.
In the following studies, some possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission between animals to humans should be considered or passed aside.
First, bats could be reservoir greeting for SARS-CoV-2 relatives who are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecologies with bats by means of a sacrifice or a coal miner.
Secondly, the milling trend may be one of those new introductory users for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Man gets a virus by means of the sacrifice and the meat consumption of hunting.
Perhaps, many mammals, including pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Revei antibodi against pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and ARS-CoV-2 adaptment may occur in the third species that is good with bats or grinding.
SARS-CoV-2's original search for animal origin is still under way.
In spite of various kinds of animal sensitives, three major factors from a virus side are also important to make it easier for CV to cross species barrier.
First of all, the rate is relatively high in RNA applications.
Compared with another single RNA virus, the rate of the CoV lossion rate can be considered "the height" to the rate of the average substitutes ~104 per year per path, depending on the stage of CV adapting to new sinks.
CV has an exoribonicide case, deletion that leads to a very high probability, antructation, or even invibility.
Interestingly, the bleleleotide Redesivir disorder is known to suppress the CoV applications through this exotic hybiterlease and polymerase statement depends-RNA.
Redesivir is one of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that is most promising to be tested in clinical experiments.
Even so, the CoV navigation rate is about a million times higher than the peripheral rate.
In addition, the mustation rate is often high when CV has not been adapted to insubs.
The SARS-CoV link that has a high rate of i.D., the SARS-CoV-2 tissue rate is actually lower, displaying higher levels of adapt to humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another welcome that is associated with humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this is also true of MERS-CoV that has been adapted to Arabic camels.
Theoretically, the small possibility that genetic departure will quickly make vaccines and agents interact with SARS-CoV-2 are not effective.
Secondly, the CV genoms in CV provide extra dieins in genom modifications, for immunation and recombination, thus improving co-in-in-cervation skills, which are worth showing it to present a new CoV when the condition is appropriate.
It's supported by many distinct sets of books open and protein functions that are anchored toward the end of 3 genom.
Third, CV often changes templates randomly during RNA applications through unique "option-salin" mechanism.
In a safe haven that works as a mixer, untaque exchange occurs often during the CV Rapalog.
The complete and subgenmics which are very gay could be recombined to form a new CV.
The natural recombination evidence has been found on HCV-HIC1 and HCV-OC43, as well as on CV animals like SL-CoV bats and CV-HIT bats.
The virus-inction in connection with transmission
In addition to three virus factors mentioned above, contacting the virus with apierable reception is another major factor that affects interracy transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection evidence during the events of inter-track transmission.
Based on comparing analysis between the SARS-CoV and musang, SARS-CoV is thought to have a quick adapt in different immunes, especially with the tissue on RBD protein S.
In general, RBD protein S CV interact with cell reception and intensively became a target of immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is a 318 - to-510 acid on fragmen S1, which relates to human ACE2 and its driver as the path into the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize an ACE2 pickers, which include bats, bats, rats, and dogs, thus allowing inter - virus transmission.
In fact, only 6 amino acid acid acids are observed differently between the human and bastola virus in RBD and 4 of them located at a tax reception motive for communicating with the AC2 receivers.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N tissue and S487T in his RBD, which may add to the harmony of the protein to tonsjolan relationship with the ACE2 human reception.
In other words, these two amino acids may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell reception as SARS-CoV.
The difference of 30% of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein units is making it possible for the harmony of protein S with ACE2 human possibilities to change.
In fact, a chryo-EM study shows the order of human bonding and SARS-CoV-2 to 20 times higher than the size of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein.
What's also important to know is whether there's another driver who might be required for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interesting thing, HCV-NL63 also agreed with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There's a lot of other HCV receptions, such as Aminopeptose N for HCV-29E and acid 9-O-antrecilation for HCoV-OC43.
These refuseors may also be involved in the success of this CoV in humans after the transmission between their animal benefits.
In addition to cell reception, the end result of HCV transmission is also arranged by the information factor and other hospitality.
The difference between individual and natural reservoir differences, such as bats, Arab camels, and animals can be a barrier to interstrupt transmission.
HCV must take over the risk of immunciation and break insulation factors to make it successful in interstrupt transmission.
In this case, molecular marks in the field of contact with these vital viruses must still be identified and defined.
The review of all genoms is not as good as looking at the hanging and the SARS-CoV-2 problem is likely to be beneficial.
New HCV image: Back to the beginning of the plague
CV bat clone gives him a huge chance to show him a new HCV.
In this case, CV bat acts as a HCV gene necklace.
In addition, fast recreation and genetic recombination also move HCV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, obtaining or losing a new protein-disputation gene is potentially modified in the virus - positive changes.
Among the SARS-CoV internet proteins are expected to play a major role in adapting to human adapting because the virus of family bat-SARS-CoV was isolated found to be found in a wide range of protein ORF8.
SARS-CoV with a particular deletion of 29 ruleotides found at the isolation of man’s early epidemic.
This removal separates anORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be a adaptive tissue that supports immunation.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombindation with alfa-CoV's line of alfa-CoV and kgam-CoV, with a number of smaller recombiscedercies located in the polymerase economy that depends on the RNA.
The location of recombination is also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and most of the nsp14.
In the same way, the recombination between various lini descendants lasting in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which happens in the Arab in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recombination has also been observed in HCV other HCV where HCV has combined with another CoV animal in his nonducial gene.
It should also be taken into consideration that artificial selection can play in an accidental change in genom vitrall, a great possibility resulting from the virus’s increased selection pressure, such as by an immune system.
The example of this effect is the loss of a complete ORF4 on HCVV29E prototype due to deletiotode.
While whole ORF4 can be observed on bat virus and a camel that mixs with HCV-29E, alfa-CoV alkasa shows a single fleotide diet that results in order.
Last time, the HCV evolution was also moved by its reservation pressure of reservity.
Symptoms of light or no symptoms detected when CV's infected bat showed adapting between CV and bat.
It seems that bats are well adapted to CV in anatomy and philosophy.
For example, disabled in the function of proinflamation response in the bat will lower the CoV pathology efficient.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in the bat is driven by the rising of the cell’s subprocesssion of typical NKG2/CD94 (CD94, and the level of simple hyscocompatibility of I class.
In addition, the high level of healthy oxygen species (ROS) of high metolic activity can suppress CoV applications and influence exposure to experimention by experimentives so that it provides the pressure of the selection for the development of a virus that is very ecogenicated when getting into a new host.
A more pathogenic strategy may also develop through recombination, resulting in a new protein or protein feature to adapt in moderation.
Therefore, it's not a coincidence that three HCVs have just appeared in the last two bases.
CoV is nonpatogenic or causes light symptoms in his reservoir greeting, such as bats and camels.
CV has a strong application without triggering strong immune reactions.
This is where a secret is a secret of no symptoms and the cause of a heavy case in human infection.
Heavy symptoms are mainly due to excessive immune reactions and skin storms, with increased lung damage if imun response is getting stronger.
On the contrary, on the crew without symptoms, the immune response is out of CV applications.
The same strategy to decide an immune response response reaction might be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong on the bat.
Therefore, I'm an interferon type of I, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection on humans, should be helpful.
In addition, the NLRP3 in bat is defectative.
With this reason, inhibibisom NLRP3 with MC950 may be useful in CC950 handling COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2's presence follows the general alur of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While I-CoV bats who share 95% of the nucleus with SARS-CoV has been found, there are also CV bats who share 96% of the entroximia with SARS-CoV-2.
Even though the boisang and other animals in that market were found to carry an identical virus with SARS-CoV, the guide immediately for the SARS-CoV-2 haven't been found.
Beta-CoV changeerums which are highly popularly popular with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which suggests that milling trade may play as one of the co-CoV shoes or Me-Comerg grinders may provide gene fragments in the end of SARS-CoV-2 version.
Though questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by humans on purpose or deliberately.
CV's back to the center of the SARS-CoV-2 plague recently.
Sttudi CV on bats and other animals have changed our perceptions about the importance of the origin of the zoonotics and animal reserv for HCoV on human transmission.
So many evidence indicates that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 came from bat and was shown to man through a pen.
Considering that the SARS-CoV infection is from contact between humans and mikes in the wet market, maybe the wet market cover and the killing of all the mikes in it that ends the SARS epidemic effectively.
With the same reason, the milling trend should be moved from wet market to prevent the transmission of the zoonotics, considering the discovery of several lines of my family-CoV changeing milling near SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism is distributed to humans through milling trends and other mammals still have to be classified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in Arabic ink.
The camel works as an important transport tool and as a main source for meat, milk, skin, and wool products for the local community.
Arab stage spread wide throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we can't kill all the camels to control the MERS, as they do in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS epidemic, the conventional approach must be done to develop vaccines for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other path of infection control.
Before we get rid of this virus, new genes can show up and cause plague.
CoV zonotics leave in the wild.
In particular, CV bats are quite diverse.
There's a lot of possibilities for this CV zonotic to reproduce and experience recombination, which resulted in a new CV that is easier to be learned and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture eats wild animals in some places in China has to be abandoned to reduce contact that doesn't need between humans and animals.
With SARS's bitter experience, MERS, and COVID-19, preparation and a better teaching plan to be applied.
Actually, many viruses have been on this planet since ancient times.
These viruses are in their natural reservoirs until there's a chance to preach.
Although bats have many features supporting the virus’s spread, human opportunities have been attacked by bats and other wildlife species can be explained if people are trained to avoid wild animals.
Surveilans are continuing against mammals need to be done to better understand CV and its natural ecology, which will prove helpful in preventing animal transmissions and future plague.
As a conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the bonosists from the virus is humans must keep distance from the ecology reserologic virus.
Some part of the original SARS-CoV-2 puzzles have not been found.
First, if the bat exposes the SARS-CoV-2 virus to milly, the condition when the bat and the milling of ecology is important to know.
Second, if the bat has a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way man hits with the bat must be determined.
Third, if there are third mammals that play as a true metaphor, the way these mammals interact with other species, which include humans, bats, and millers should be explained.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, good experiment infection and surveys must be done.
Either bat, milling, or some other mammal, is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or the parent virus that is almost identical can be identified in its natural host in the future.
The continued research in this field will parse the SARS-CoV-2 cycle in animals, with important implications in the control and control of the COVID 19s on humans.
The update of "unpredicated" and "serdicated" COVID19 has to be done
In February 6, 2020, our team published quick advice for diagnosis and the treatment of new coronary infection 20199-nCoV.
Nevertheless, the coronary disease is 2019 (COVID) a new disease, our awareness and our knowledge grew increasingly based on the current research findings and medical experience clinis; therefore, a diagnosis and care strategy continued to be updated.
In this letter, we answered one of our comments on our guidance and provided the latest diagnosis for "presidious" and "servations" based on the Guide of Dignosis and Pencators for the CVIDS National Health Committee of the Chinese Republic.
In December 20,19, the crownvirus was born 20199-nCV) in an outbreak, which is currently commonly called coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) and that virus is named a mlvirus per met respiratory syndrome 2 (SARSCV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained the COVID 19th as a academy.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed the quick - and - guidance guide has been published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
They have been intrigued by it since its release.
However, it needs to be noted that the COVID was a new disease, our awareness, and our knowledge increased based on the current research findings and practical experience of clinis; therefore, the strategy of diagnosis and care continues to be updated as well.
For example, the Guide Guide for Dignosis and Controls for the 19th-century C.E., issued by the Chinese National Health Commission (pttrupts keenlywww.n.g.gov.gon.cn.cn.), between 1 January 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has produced seven editions with a number of contexts have been changed enough.
Our guide received a comment from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple score item based on their clinis experience.
Their work has added to our work evidence of guided us and has become an excellent reference for this worldwide observance.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
Even so, their work will also require update based on the Di mightussis Guide and the administrators for the latest GIVID (the seventh test) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (three March 20,20), to confirm the unexpected case required combination of one of the history of the genocides with two linis to create conventional analysis, or the need for eclinis's three-disciation if there is no obvious epidemic history:
History: (1) travel history or living in the city of Ocean and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVIDS cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the awitan symptoms; (2) contact with the SARS-CoV-2 cases (with positive acid acid tests); (3) patients with fever or fever symptoms of the city and surrounding communities have been reported in the last 14th day's history of the preceding situation in the last class, or two weeks.
Cinisic character: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) feature of COVIDS infection infection; (3) total count of the white blood cells shows the number of normal blood cells, down, or reduced at the beginning stage.
Identifying the confirmed case should be based on an unexpected case with one of the pathogens or the sophological evidence as follows: (1) A positive real-time test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the existence of the entire virus is based on a high extent to a new coronavirus; (3) positive evidence for antibody Idig and antiGVOVO-CCI's on trials in a positive phase of anti-CD or a negative period of recovery.
We can see that the real-time PCR-time acid test is in the sample of breathing or blood added to the second edition ( January 18, 2020) and the third January 2020).
A blood transfusion is added to the fourth edition (7 January 20,20) and the fifth ( February 2020); then, evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This scenario is based on the continuing research of researchers to find a particular antibiotic acid port for quick diagnosis, as well as samples of cliques, which increase the supply of various speculations, and support a particular antibodiation of antibodiation in the confirmation criteria.
Moreover, there are more evidence that reminds us to be alert to patients by symptoms of a positive and without symptoms.
Therefore, the alir Zhou et must be updated because they're declaring people without symptoms as "low blood."
The score system also needs to be verified in practice and chemistry study in the future.
As a cover, we hope for more immediate evidence to come up and ask the reader to comment.
To be diagnosed with "spunicated" and "secile confirmed", we recommend following and following the latest guidance in each country.
Our team will also renew our guide frequently as help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths because of COVID-19, the death rate of the highest day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
It's the highest number of deaths in one day because of the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCC) reported a number of cases of infection that included 114 active cases and 33 medical cases living at home.
It's a total of 17 deaths.
In a long - reported story, director IEDC, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death covered four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60, two cases between 51 and 60 years of age, and one case between 41 -50.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 20, 2020, the World Health Organization (HO) expressed COVID 19 as a academy.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agentcy, a local news office, that one of the dead is Jalalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Anti Conupsi Bengal Congregation, who was treated at Kuwait Maitee Hospital.
On Saturday, in a high video announcement, Minister of Street and Bridges, Obava Quader said the general transportation will be stopped longer than planned, until the next Saturday.
This general transport stop has begun since March 26th and planned to end on Saturday, April 4th.
Transport needs -- medical, fuel, and food -- still allowed.
The first-century COVID infection on Bangladesh was on March 8, on two new ones returned from Italy and also one of them.
On March 19, the three men recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds the number of one million worldwide
On the day Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections goes beyond a million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the crown virus.
The peak happened on the same day when Malawi confirmed his first corona virus infection and Zambia had his first death related to the crown virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free of the crown virus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1.05635 cases confirmed, including 79.332 cases in twenty - four hours since 10th of Central Europe (0,800 UC) on April 4th.
In the United States (ASS), it is noted that there are over 244 grand cases of crown virus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News office reported that quoting Johns Hopkins University data, there are over 1,000 deaths in the U.S. virus infection.
All over the world, the countries are announcing even more strict actions to interfere with the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, extended the territory to May 1.
National President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians will remain paid without having to go to work until April 30th.
Parlemen Portugal made a sound for extending national emergency status for 15 days; the sound escaped with 215 votes supported, ten voice abstains, and one voice refused.
The Saudi Arabs extend the night hours of the holy city of Mekai and Madah all day; before, the hour was only between 3 o’clock in the morning and 6 in the morning.
Thai plans to apply the night hours between 10 p.m. and 4 am.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country had extended the command to stay at home until May 1.
Australia’s stores dropped the cost of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, Australia Woolworth and Coles's store network dropped between toilet paper purchases to two and one transactionr in all stores at national levels.
ALDI also applied one-one, on Monday.
This limit is announced as a message on the counter and on the Facebook page of the network.
A buyer reportedly set up supplies because of the fear of COVID. If the people had to do independent isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted toilet paper purchases to deliver to the house until one warrant.
This change follows the four - pack checks of transactions that earlier applied Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In his media statement on March 8, Coles reported that by doing the 4th range, "many stores have been out in an hour since the delivery," and they call that request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unpredictance".
Last week, according to one of the Woolworths talkers.
Costco store in Canberra is also restricted to two weeks ago.
To avoid disbelief, Coles booked larger supplies than masks and increased delivery frequencies, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALD has prepared for special Wednesday activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of Australia’s Pertel Association, said that the fairyists are trying to improve supplies, but local government limits for truck delivery make it difficult.
He anticipated a production raise, while the suppliers are trying to fulfill their requests, and a little bit more special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since the supply had been lifted early, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a news report.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortater, professor of Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills up supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet paper was a big deal of food, so the amount of supplies are low and, if it's sold, make a lot of free space on the shelf, so it's getting more taste.
Coles and Woolworths think that if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products such as toilet paper and amputation can be [used] and there's a huge amount, the taste may be explained, Russell Zimmerman says through the ABC News Office.
The toilet paper reviewer Who Gives said on Wednesday last that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Tisu Toit Kleenex, and Soiers Pater, who made Sorbent, stress them working 24/7 to keep the supply, according to News.comau.
Domain.com, a royal estate site, reports that some property dealers offer free toilet paper to the first auction in Melbourne, when more auctions are held because the buyer takes off for a long weekend break.
Our Thursday News edition, a daily printed in Darwin, includes eight pages meant to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores actually refused to apply limitations, according to ABC Australia report on March 3, they said that they didn't plan to apply the purchase borders.
Russell Zimmerman added that other product is also in high demand, including masks, suppliers, dry foods, laundry, and flour.
Similarly, on Sunday afternoon from England Ocado, he observed restricting his flow of toilet paper purchases from Andrew to two packs.
The World Health Organization (HO) states COVID 19 as a academy
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID epidemic that is happening -- the disease caused by the SARrus SARS-CoV-2-- as a academy.
Although the word "semema" refers only to how wide the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO records it needs to encourage the government to act:
All the countries can still change the course of the academy.
If countries detect, test, handle, isolate, and mobilize their people as response, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebrereus, director General General WHOO.
We were extremely concerned about the level of the preaching and the public, and because of the changing levels of behavior.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Center and the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, this academy "never happened before."
He said, in a note published CNN in February, "but besides influence, there was no respiratory virus that has ever been discovered from its appearance until the ongoing global preaching of global news."
Ghebreresus expressed a similar view, saying, "We've never seen a panbrequed by the crownvirus."
He went on, "and we've never seen an academy that can be handled at the same time."
The new basis status of the United Nations's decision on January was that of the outbreak of the outbreak of the world.
Director National Institute of Allergy and Infecilious Undersase of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says about this plague, "this plague is going to get worse."
Until Thursday, Assodated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID 7 cases around the world, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The 20-20-20th coronaremia is a 2019thallum of coronavirus disease (COVID19) which is continuing and caused by heavy meth disease syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The dome was identified in the West, Chinese, on December 20,19, as a World Health Institute for People of the World on January 30, 2020, and was declared a panmation on March 11, 2020.
Until April 1020, about 1.1 million COVIDS cases have been reported in 210 countries and the most influential region, which has resulted in some 97,000 deaths.
About 800,000 people have recovered.
A fatality number of cases is estimated 4% in Chinese, while worldwide is about to start from 13,04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Public symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing.
Compression can cover pneumia and acute breath syndrome.
The time from being exposed to the awitan symptoms in mostly about five days, but it can be ranging from two to twelve days.
There's not yet known vaccines or specific alternative treatments.
The primary treatment is a symptoptic therapy and a positive action, which includes washing hands, closing your mouth when coughs, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and isolation for people who are expected to be infected.
Authority throughout the world has responded by performing travel boundaries, quarantines, hours, danger management, and facility cover.
This academy has led to a heavy global economic breakdown, a delay in cultural, political, religious, sports, and the vast awareness of the supplying of what is fought with panic purchases.
School and university have been closed in both national and local levels in 193 countries, which affects some 99,4 percent of the population of the world.
Misinformation of this virus has spread out from the sky and there is an incident of xenopobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with Eastern and Southeast Asian characteristics, and people from the area with significant virus cases.
As a result of a drop of travel and heavy industry cover, air pollution and carbon emissions dropped.
Health officials in Witat, Chinese Chinesego (buni propinsi Hubei), reported the pneumon case with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and the investigation was done on January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Juanan Sea Food Center and because that virus is thought to have an original origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a new virus found and traveled with the crownvirus bat, headvirus size, and SARS-CoV. The first person is known to get sick on December 1, 2019, and that man doesn't have clearly seen the market.
Among the initial disks reported on December 20,19, two researchers found to have a connection with that market.
On March 13, 20, 2020, a report not yet verified from South China Morning Post reported that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from the Hubei province, is probably the first one.
There may be a large number of reported cases, especially among people with smaller symptoms.
Up to 26 February, a relatively few cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds into 2.4% of cases worldwide, England’s scientific advisers, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 percent of the British population need to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have tested COVID-19 and whose test results have confirmed positive according to official protocol.
Until March 23, no country has tried more than 3 percent of its population, and many countries have made official policy against testing people with light symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published in March 16 found that in China, as far as 23 January, 86% of COVID infection is not detected, and that this undisputed infection is a source of infection for 79% of cases that have been expanded.
A survey of statistics published in March 30 estimates that the number of infection in Italy is estimated to be larger than reported cases.
The initial estimate of basic reproductive figures (R0) for COVID-19 is 14 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center of Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number was possibly 5.7.
Most people are cured by COVID.
For those who do not recover, time from symptoms between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID.
In China, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred on people over 60 years of age and 75% had a previous health disorder, which included cardiovascular and diabetes.
The actual fatality of COVID may be much higher, considering official numbers may not include people who die without being tested, such as, at home, in care, etc.
The partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the academy is beyond the official total of COVID's death by 4-5 times more.
A woman speaking for the Control and Prevention Center (CDC) states: "We know [a number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number", a statement that has been strengthened by the nomilia report on the figure too low in the US.
The first death outside the mainland occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
Until February 28th, outside the mainland Chinese, more than deaths recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Until March 13, over forty countries and the most massive regions have reported deaths, on every continent, except Antarctica, in general, some measure used to count deaths.
These numbers vary according to region and time, as well as the number of testings, health care systems, treatment options, time from the first plague, and character of population such as age, sex, and overall health.
According to statistics Johns Hopkins University, death ratio of global cases is 6.0% (97.039/1.617,204) by April 1020.
These numbers vary according to the region.
In China, the death rate for the death rate goes down from 17.3% (for people by filming 1-10th January 1, 2020) became 0, used for people by witting symptoms after February 1 2020). Another factor covers the fatality rate of cases (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who died of certain diseases, and fatality (IFR), according to the death rate of certain diseases.
These statistics are not bound time and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of numbers have tried to count these numbers for certain populations.
Between the Envience-Bed Medicaline University of Oxford estimate the fatality of infection for all levels between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest limit of this estimate is as far as the result of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistics that analyze the impact of the payoff on the CFR estimate.
WHO confirms that this academy can be controlled.
The peak and end of the epidemic are not obvious and may be different according to location.
Maciej Boni of State University Penn said: “Without control, an epidemic is usually efficient and then it starts to drop when the disease runs out of available sinners.
Yet, it's almost impossible to make reasonable projections right now about when that happens.
The senior medical officer Zong Nanshan claims that "this plague may end June" if the whole country can be stolen to follow WHO advice about the steps to stop the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiee & Trophim Medicaline states that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, possibly for a year or two."
According to the studies of the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other steps will be needed "as much as vaccines are available (in existence 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University states: "I think it's possible that this crownvirus, because it's so easy to be diagnosed, can disappear all of it" and this disease "is probably turning into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The attention of the repeat will depend on group immunity and mutate levels.
COVID's symptoms can be relatively specific and infected people can be without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry rock (68%).
Less public symptoms include fatigue, respiratory input production (flegma), loss of smell, fatigue, pain, pain and muscles, headaches, headaches, aches, gums, dayre, or synansis. The WHO says that about one person in six people is sick and troubled.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are describing emergency symptoms involving breathing problems, anguish or chest pain that settles, suddenly confusion, trouble walking, and lowness of face and lips; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms occur. Further development can be severe, depression, depression, depression, depression, and depression and death.
Some infected people may be asytomatic, or without linis symptoms, but with tests that confirm infection, researchers suggest that those close contact with infected people should be set on strict and tested to make sure that they are not infected.
Chinese people estimate assitopic ratios ranging from a few to 44%.
Incultation periods (when between infection and awitan symptoms) are typical of between 1 and 14 days, at least 5 days. For example, the number of LOVID sufferers who lose their initial sense of early 30%, then fall down to 15%.
The details of the way this disease spread are still carefully examined.
A COVID-19 Service is believed to occur especially at close times and through a small volt that was produced when the rock, with a lack, or speaking; near contact is a close contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research found that a stone that is not covered can cause the drolett to be moved to ten feet (1.2 m) to 82 feet (7 m).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be activated by a tiny drop that survives longer in the air and results when it comes to speaking.
Drolets can fall in the mouth or the nose of a man who is near him or may be corrupted into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cervation of the lung heart (RJP), can make the rate of breathing turn into aerosol and then spread through the air.
The Theocratic Ministry can also occur when a person touches the surface that is infected, including skin, and it touches the eyes, noses, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through trial, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has a possible SARS-CoV-2 transmissions by legally. The most contagious virus in the first three days after awitan symptoms, even though the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and at further stages of disease.
People provide positive tests to three days before awitan symptoms, which display transmissions may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few reports of the assitopic cases confirmed by the lab, but the asitopics have been identified by some countries when contact exposure investigation.
The European Center and Control (ECDC) noted that although it is not fully clear how easy this disease is spreading, one common person is infected by two to three others.
In particular, it has been found that the virus can be detected for three days on plastics and steels under 304, one day on cartons, and over four hours on copper.
Still, this varies according to moisture and temperature, animal and other animals have tested positive COVID.
There is no evidence that animals can infect a virus with humans, although the British authorities suggest that they wash hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have been touched by infected people.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia patients related to the quster case of acute respiratory disease in Wect.
All features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to the crownvirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if it gets home soap, which expands the protection envelope.
The virus is thought to have a gzonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that the crownvirals are geneticly coupled with the genus Betacoronvirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (the B line) along with two gobacts of bats.
This virus has 96% in common at all levels of genom with another coronary sample of bats (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 20,20, researcher Chinesehoa discovered that there was just one difference between amino acids in certain parts of the genoms between the flu and the human virus.
Until now, the comparison of the entire genom has found most of 92% genetic material between the milly crown and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the milling is the SARS-CoV-2 guide.
The infection by the virus can be diagnosed while based on symptoms, but confirmation is eventually performed by the reaction of the transcripation chain (rRT-PRCC) on the infected string or thus fueling CT testing.
A study that compares between the PCR with the CT in Ocean shows that the CT is more sensitive than the PCR, but less specific, with many features associated with pneumonics and other diseases.
In March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended "CT cannot be used for filtering or as the first test in molecular diagnosis of COVID 19th."
The WHO has published some RSS-CoV-2 testing protocols, which are first distributed on January 17.
Tests using the reaction of political polymerase transscription-time (rRT-PR) chain reaction.
Testing can be done on breathing samples or blood.
The results are generally available within hours until a few days.
Mostly, this test is done in a nasofaring use, but it can also use the throat tap. A number of labs and companies are developing analogic test that detect antibodi.
In April 6, 2020, not one test of these mythology has proved quite accurate to make extensive use of it.
In the U.S., the research tests developed by Cesex have been approved for emergency use, only by the lab identified.
The characteristics of radiography and ctomography features on people who are symtommetic content include ossomatic versotic vertific acid and no persmocretic eleura.
The Italian Radiology Society is building international databases for a confirmation discovery on the confirmed case.
Because it's infected with other infections such as denoviumvirus, non-conservation of PCR has limited speculations in identifying COVID19.
A great study in China compared the results of the HIT with the PCR and shows that although less specific for infection, more sensitive and more sensitive exposure thus suggested being considered a pent in the field of epidemic.
The convultional tissue based on artificial intelligence has been developed to detect the features of the virus with radiography and CT.
The strategy to prevent this disorder involves maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, noses, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing tissues when the rock or sinks and immediately dumps tissue into trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
These steps of physical restraint are also required to prevent the effect of the government in various regions. The government has limited or urged you to stop all unnestial trips and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak of the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the scale of society in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some members of society don't know where or how they are infected. The health care treatment that deals with people who may be infected is recommended to perform standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contacts are important to the health authorities to determine the sources of infections and prevent further transmissions.
The use of data locations from the government's cell phones for this purpose has triggered a matter of privacy, with its exiting statements from Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations that call this kind of surveyation.
Mobile applications have been implemented or proposed to be used voluntarily, and on April 7, 2020, more than groups of experts are working friendlyly friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth to record the distance of users to other phones.
Next, the user will receive a message if they're close to someone who's positive for COVID-19. Dececulate about how to prevent infection; for example, homing their noses and grucing with un effective drugs.
No COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Put his hands into action to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hand looks dirty; before eating; and after doing the nose, cough, or sink.
It's because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by household soap that damaged its protective layer.
In addition, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol - based amputation by alcohol content at least 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages not to touch the eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands.
The surface can be attached to a number of bits (in a minute of synthectan due to rust - bearing steel surfaces), including intanol 62 –7%, proplasing 50–100%, staclothium 0.1%, hydrogen%, and povidone-done, 027.
Another link, like clarzalcondes and corthexin glut, is less effective.
CDC recommends that if there is an unexpected or confirmed COVID case in the public facility, such as office or child shelter, all areas like offices, bathrooms, general areas, electronic equipment together like tablets, screens, screenshots, remote controls, and ATM machines that are used by patients, must be infected.
Health organization recommends that people cover their mouth and noses with nails carved or use tissue when cough or sink, and immediately throw away tissue.
The surgeon is recommended for a person who may have been infected because using masks can limit volume and the distance run the spread when speaking, cliques, and coughs.
WHO has issued instructions about time and style of masking.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "I need morekers to reduce the tendency of people to touch with their faces with less clean hands, which is a major resource."
WHO recommend the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, like people who care for COVID patients, even though WHO also admits that using masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun pushing masks to public members.
In the United States, CDC recommended the use of nonmedic facial masks made of cloths. Chinese specifically recommend medical masks once used to healthy people, especially when near (1 ft m) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends surgical masks when using public transport or living in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia forbid its people to go out into public places without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austria government requires that everyone enter the store to wear face masks.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear face masks while in public places.
Taiwan, who produced ten million masks per day since March, required that passengers and buses between cities wear facial masks per April 1.
Panama obligates the use of masks every time she goes outside the house, and recommends the making of an artificial face mask for those who can't afford a mask.
Face lines are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social limitations (also called physical limit) are the act of infection that is meant to slow down the spread of disease by creating close contact between individuals.
Social restrictions include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closings, places, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can apply social restrictions by staying at home, restricting their journey, avoiding areas of public use, without contact, and keeping the physical distance from others.
In modern times, many governments are demanding or glorifying social restrictions in the worst - hit areas.
The maximum number of people gathered together that the U.S. government bodies and health organizations are rapidly reduced, starting from 250 people (if not aware of a COVID in a region) became 50 people, and then 10 people.
In March 22, 2020, Germany prohibited a meeting in the public area involving more than two people. Lansia and people with a medical condition based on diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and an immune system that is at risk of serious illness and complications are recommended more than two people to the extent of possible home to the population of disease. On March 20th, health disease, hypertenment, and other health problems, and it begins to reduce the risk of serious health problems that are a physical, or physical capacity to maintain a physical contact.
The use of the term "a social limit" suggests that people have to isolate themselves completely socially and not encourage people to stay in touch with others through alternative forms. Some authorities have provided sexual guidelines for use during the time of the academy.
This review includes encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or viral symptoms.
Personal isolation at home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and people who are expected to be infected.
Health bodies have been given detailed instructions for proper self - esteem: many governments demand or recommend independence for all populations that live in peaceful areas.
The most strict self - restraintal instruction is produced for those who are of a high risk group.
A person who may be exposed to a CIVID sufferer and recently traveled to countries or territories with the extensive COVID message of the COVIDs were advised to do self-servation for 14 days since the last possible birth rate.
The strategy in the control of the plague is a watch or a shot, and my check.
Consideration was done at the beginning of the epidemic and intended to track and isolate an infected person and do other steps for the control of infection and vaccines that were intended to stop the spread of disease throughout the population.
When no longer possible to progress in the spread of disease, the further effort goes to the stage of my examination: these steps are taken to slow down the preaching work and reduce its impact on health and public care systems.
Combination action and my check can be done at the same time.
Expression requires more extreme steps to reverse the academy by reducing the root rate to less than 1; the benefits of the disease disease are trying to lower the top of the epidemic, which is known to be hit by an epidemic.
It reduces the risk of being overwhelmed by health care and giving more time for vaccine development and medicine.
The nonfarmasies to handle the plague include individual precautions, such as hand cleanliness, using face masks, and self-servation; the steps at the level of society that are directed to physical restrictions, such as closing school and canceling the mass meeting; public celibacy to encourage receivers and participation in this kind of intervention; and steps in the environment, such as the surface of the surface of the community, which is a sharply designed to break up when the whole city's course, which is considered to be a strong, and it.
Other countries also apply steps that are designed to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduces mass filters and local quarantines, and warns about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who commit self - denial and put on huge fines for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of face masks and punish medical supplies. Simulation of the United States and the United States show that my ignorance (explosion, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and subpression has had great challenges.
The optimological policy can reduce the top of health care to 2/3 and deaths to half, but still resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and slow health systems.
Subpression may be selected, but the virus must still be maintained within human population (or until vaccines are available), if this is the first, it will climb back at a quick rate.
Long-term update to press the bread caused social and economic impact.
There is not yet a specific drug approved for COVID-19, but the development effort is being done, which includes the testing of existing drugs.
Eating free flu drugs, drinking enough water, and rest can help ease symptoms.
Depends on the level of enlightenment, oxygen therapy, intravene fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can add to the patient’s condition.
Some of the previously approved compounds for the treatment of another virus is being copied to use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some " traditional medicine and home" can reduce symptoms caused by SARS-CoV19.
WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting health care for the needs of COVID patients is the basic step in responding to the epidemic.
ECDC and European regional offices have provided guidelines for hospital and health services to reduce resources in various levels, including focusing on lab service for the COLDS testing, if possible to cancel election procedures, and to isolate positive COVID patients, and to increase intensive care skills by training and increase the amount of ventilation and sleepers.
There are different theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first Nalvirus case known could be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wita, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of crownvirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are largely related to the Merchan food market, which also sells animals alive, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these kinds of animals; or, by other words, the virus has a gzonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the House of Ocean told their colleagues about "coronavirus like SARS".
Eight of this doctor, including Li Wenan, was warned by the police for spreading false villages, and others, Ai Fen, was punished by his superior warning.
The city’s Health Commission then launched an announcement to the public on December 31, and told the WHOO.
Quite a lot of pneumony cases are not reported to health authorities in the West who then triggered investigation on January early January, at the beginning of the outbreak of the epidemic, the number has doubled every seven and a half days.
At the start of January 20, 2020, the virus spread to another Chinese province, supported by an migration during the New Year Imek and because Whan was the center of transportation and transit train.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one person in Shenzhen.
The next official data shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.
About 200 countries and the famous region have at least one case.
Because of the academy in Europe, many countries in Schengen Province limit freedom movement and control the border.
The national park covers measures of watchers, such as quarantine (also known as the command to live in houses, orders to take refuge in places, or to keep in places, and at night. On April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in some sort of quarantine regions in the United States, over 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people quarantined in South Africa, and 6 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world are in some kind of local quarantine, which is growing into 2.6 billion people two days later — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed COVIDF case can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Ocean; one unconsisted report showed the earliest case in November 17th.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed clear cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on December 26; this observation tells the hospital to CDC Jianghan on December 27.
The initial genetic test of a patient sample on December 27, 2019 indicates that the crownvirus is like SARS.
The public announcement was released by the City Health Commission on December 31th.
WHO was told on the same day.
When this notice was made, the doctor in the West was warned of the strike by the police for "destination of the village-desus" about the plague.
The National Health Commission of Chinese citizens initially claimed that there is no clear evidence of man's effect on humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later explained by the secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as "the war of the people" to comment on the virus.
In quarantine called "the largest quarantine in human history", Cordon sanitaire was announced on January 23, to stop the journey and out of Whanti, and extend the total number of 15 cities in Hubei, which affected about 57 million people.
Personal use of vehicles is forbidden in the city.
The New Year’s celebration was canceled in many places.
Authorities also announce temporary hospital development, Huoshenshan Hospital, which is finished in 10 days.
Another hospital was built after him, Leshenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
In addition to a newly built hospital, Chinese Chinese also changed 14 other facilities in the West, such as convention and stadium, to become a temporary hospital.
The whole university and school in the country are also closed.
Hong Kong and Sou apply a few steps, especially in schools and colleges.
Steps to work from a long distance applied in some areas in China.
Travel limits were carried inside and outside Hubei.
The public transportation was modified and museums all over China were closed for a while.
The control of public movements is applied in many cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (over half of the population) faced some kind of restrictions outside the home.

Other damages to this new disease and very rapidly developed are religious services, large sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashionbs.
Film industry has also suffered disturbances. The Vatican announced that the Holy festival in Rome, which fell on the last week of Christian repentance Prapassi, was canceled.
Much of the encouragement encourages Christian older ones to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services through radio, live air or television, while others offer any drive-in or seeding services.
By closing churches and chapels by Rome’s Catholic Couscule and covering Peter’s temple of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public meetings in churches, mosques, temples, temples, and grogwars.
Iran's Ministry announced Friday's prayer in the border and places of worship and then closed, while the Saudi Arabs prohibited it from entering foreign pilgrimages and its inhabitants into the holy places.
This academy has caused the most significant disturbance in the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most large sports events were dismissed or postponed, including the League of EUFA 201920, the Premier League 20192020, the EUFA 2020, the NBBA 2020, and the NHL of the 2020s.
This is a 2020 summer Olympics plan, first scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the show will be "reaped back until after 2020, but it will not be over the summer of 2021."
This has caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites report significant increases. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delay or cancels the concerts.
A lot of large theaters like Broadway's, too, delay all show.
Artists explore various ways of continuing to produce and share the works over the Internet as alternative to traditional live-time shows, such as a live-off slide concert or to make the web based on artists to perform, spread, and publish their work.
A lot of memorrus's Internet is spread out by many people who turn to humor and distract in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the spread of the COVID 19th, there has been a rise in prejudice, xenophobiia, and racism against Chinese and East Asia descendants, and for people of the surrounding region in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Fear, suspicion, and widespread hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia-Pasic region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still limited in Chinese) recorded a trace of racism in various groups around the world that Chinese people deserve to receive viruses or receive what they claim to be a fair reward.
Some countries in Africa also have an increase in anti-Tiocultum.
Many of the residents of Ocean and Hubei reported discrimination because of their homeland.
There's already no support for Chinese people, whether ding or offline, and for people in the area that is covered with viruses.
The development of the outbreak to the new hotspot countries, the first country in Europe who has experienced a serious outbreak of COVID-19, can also be targeted to suspicion and xenopia. People in countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea in the first place of letting the Chinese go into their countries to stop their disease.
In Japan, Tagar #ChineseDontCometoKan has become a trend in NZT.
Chinese and other Asians in Britain and the United States reported increasing racist harassment and assault.
The U.S. President Donald Tump criticized for calling the crownvirus a Chinese-cut, a term that critics consider racist and anti-tio bent.
The protestists in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and strangers who were evacuated from Whan to Novi Sanzary.
Students from the East India of India, limited with Chinese, and learned in the big Indian cities were reportedly having an affair with the Yuvirus plague.
The President of Bhangya Janata unit in West Budala Ghosh said that China had destroyed nature and "that's why God took vengeance on them."
That statement was then corrected by Chinese consulates in Kolkat, by calling it "strenguru". In Chinese, xenopobia, and racism against non-Tionghoa's non-Taihoaa, with strangers described as "strem" and targeted for "the damage".
Many newspapers using payment have removed it for some or all of their coronary lips.
Many scientific publishers make science related to plague are available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share the results quickly at the preceptive server, such as bioRxiv.
New disease (the disease of new pathogen disease) appears, often new in its range of outbreak or birth control methods

A lab test for coronary respiratory disease 2019 (COVID) and SARS-CoV-2 virus involves methods that detect the existence of viruses and detect the antibodi that are produced as response to infection.
The existence of the virus in the sample is confirmed with RT-PR, which detects the coronary economy.
This test is specific and is designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus services.
This test is used to confirm new infection or still active.
Antibody infection can be used for diagnosis and population survey.
The antibodi test shows the number of infected people, including those whose symptoms are too light to report or without symptoms.
The exact number of deaths and the immune levels of the population can be determined by the results of this test.
Because of limited testing, until March 20, 2020, there's not yet a country with a particular data about the prevalence of viruses in its population.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there's a great variation in the number of tests that have been done by countries.
This diversity may also affect the significant number of reported cases, which is likely to be counted too high in some countries.
Using the reaction of political polymerase transscription-time (rRT-PRR) chain, this test can be done on respiratory samples that are acquired with various methods, including nasofarlines or input samples.
Mostly, results are available in hours to two days.
Test RT-PRR did on the throat is only reliable on the first week of disease.
In time, the virus could disappear in the throat as long as it continues to be applied in the lungs.
As an alternative, for the infected person who was tested on the second week, samples can be taken from the deep breath tube by using the ethap ions or materials that can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Chatrié, Berlin, in January 20, used the reaction of the royal-time polymeration chain (rRT-PRR), and formed at least 250,000 tests to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Britain also developed testing on January 23, 2020. South Korea’s industry developed the SARS-CoV-2 software based on the PCCR. (PorwerChavirus) which was called the Konvirus on January 28, 2020.
This device is looking for the "E" gene that has all my kandviruss, and the RdRRCS-CoV-2 gene specifics for SARS-CoV-2. In the United States, the PUPI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use from the medical administration of the Chinese National Center for the SAR-CTVVCTCTCTCTCTV-CTCTV-LUTCTV-CTCTCTCTV-LI (CUTCTCTCTCTl) medical agency.
One of the three genetic tests on the old version test device was not convincing because of a reagen error, and the number of tests in the CDC in Atlanta is limited; it resulted in less than 100 samples per day than 100 samples were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components are considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and just after that state lab and local lab are allowed to test.
This test was approved by the U.S. Health Care and Food Service based on the Commission for emergency use. The U.S. commercial lab began testing at the start of March 2020.
March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the Corp confirming DOVD tests based on RRT-PCR on national scale.
In a similar way, the Quest Diastrosics made the COVID-19 testing available national on March 9, 2020.
No loyal limitations announced; gathering and speculations must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the U.S. COVID 16, tested was developed and produced by the Virology and Biology Center.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Services for Health Care Careers.
On March 19, 2020, FDA released emergency usage (U.S.A.) to Abbott Labootries for testing on the m20 Abbott system; FDA had recently issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientist.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the delight of the FDA for testing that took about 45 minutes.
FDA has agreed to test that uses i.D. acid acid technology that is not PCCR.
Because there is no need for a series of temperature changes, this method can provide positive results only in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Now there are some 18,000 of this machine in the U.S. and Abbott anticipated to increase production until it produces 50,000 tests a day. Tests that are specifically bound to bind new proteins (prote N) crowns are being developed in Taiwan, hoping to give results within 15 minutes like a quick test.
A library survey published in March 20,20 concluded that "thoric photo has a small diagnosis value at the beginning stage, the CT index is probably already present before the awitan symptoms."
A special feature on CT includes a gland-glas-glas multilobaral tasks with perversive distribution, asmmetri, and posterior.
The subpleura occupation, crazy pinging, and consoles form as a result of disease.
In Yangti, a study that compares the PCR with CT at the end of the Millennium shows that CT is more sensitive than the PCR, though less specific, with many features of contact with pneumonia and other processes.
In March 20, 2020, American College of Radiology recommended "CT cannot be used for filtering or as the first test of the COVIDpretic diagnosis." On March 20, 2020, the CC recommended PC for initial filtering.
Part of the immune response to infection is an antibodi formation involving IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals since about 7 days after awitan symptoms, to determine the immunity of disease, and in population surveys. Checking can be done in the lab (CLT) or with testing points-ofcare points (PT).
A automatic system with high results in many clinical labs will be able to do this check, but the supply will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT, it is commonly used a perversary blood specimen, although a series of spectaculars can be used to follow an immune response.
For PoCT, it is commonly used a peripherary blood specimen that gets through skin pricks.
Unlike the PCR method, extractive steps are not necessary before the examination. on March 26, 2020, FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide a notice to agencies as needed and that can now distribute their antibodi tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA based on emergency use. On the end of March 20, 2020, Eurommun Meduncal Labostrucisal Dinostics and Epitotics had been approved for their trials that could be detected antibodig and Ig with a virus in blood samples.
The test capacity for several hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than the conventional PCR check on the virus Rins.
At the beginning of April, Britain found that none of the antibodi tests he bought were good enough to be used.
Hong Kong invented a plan for unexpected patients to stay at home, "departetive emergency will give the convention savings to the patient," they spit it into it, send it back to the test, and get the test results later. The U.S.S.A. announced that the unexpected case was pioneering in the home to remove the risk of infectious patients if they have to come to the hospital or infected the ambulance to be used for an unexpected medical test.
The South Korean test center has helped to make the fastest and most expensive test of any country.
The cost was by health insurance if a doctor asked.
According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a whole capacity of 10,000 tests every week.
In March 19, test set was offered in some big cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown because only positive results reported.
A first lab survey revealed that, in total Israel, at least 4835 samples have been tested until and in the week 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6, with positive samples for SARS-CoV-2. Of Israel, researchers at Technion Hospital and Ramba have been tested and tested for tests of patients at the same time, and together, and with more proofs that test test test test is found in a positive sample of the developing by "Fins" in a few hundred meters."
With its construction monitored by the HUMI Jian unit and took 5 days, fireman suggests that the case in Hubei can be 47% higher and the cost involved in holding care could be twice as much if this test capacity does not exist.
The Atutorium Ocean will soon be followed by the Huo-Yan lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in total 12 cities across China.
On March 4, 2020, a total of its daily capacity for 50,000 tests per day. The various open sources are released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1.22 patients for the COVID-day samples by just using 93 checks. This design can be run in small labs without the need of a robot fluid.
Until March, lack and limited reagens have become servants for mass testing in the European Union, Britain, and the United States.
Because of that, a number of researchers are trying to explore the data protocols that involve sample warming on 98 °C (20 °F) for five minutes to release the Rymton gene for further testing. In March 31, the Arab Union reportedly performed more meting a crown test than any country, and ready to increase the scale of testing to achieve most of the population.
It's achieved through the combination of testing and the lab purchases of mass labs, the population of 42 Groups and SVI (in the "Huo-Yan" lab in China).
It was built in 14 days, this lab is capable of doing tens of thousands of RT-PRCs per day and it's the first lab that has this scale outside China.
Following tests and testing parts of the genetic profiles developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German recipe for the production of testing devices sent to low - production countries without resources to develop itself.
Germany was published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the United States Disease Control Center were not available until January 28 so that the tests were available in the U.S., China and the United States were troubled by the test site; two countries and Australia could not provide enough tests to meet the demands and recommendations for health experts.
On the other hand, experts say that vast testing supplies in South Korea help reduce the new coronavirus spread.
Test capacity, mostly in private sector labs, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
In March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow down COVID's flow. A high request for testing because of the vast virus - preaching campaign, hundreds of thousands of testings in private labs, and tools using and chemistry are critical.
In March 20, 2020, the Chinese reported the problem of accounting on their test tools.
In the United States, trials developed by the CDC have "cacat"; the government then removed the scracracy burden that prevents testing by private. Spanish buys tests from Tinzhen Bonesy Biochenology Co Ld, but found that the result is not accurate.
The company explains that the result may be a failure to gather samples or to use tests properly.
The Spanish emphasis says that they're going to pull the equipment that gives no right, and replace it with another test available by Shenzhen Biosasy.80% of the tests that the Czech Republic bought gave no right results.
The Prime Minister Matovč suggested that this test device be thrown into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of Turkish Health Forces said that the tests from China had "a higher error rate" and they didn't use it." The Indian government had bought 3.5 million tests from China, but at early April 20, they announced that this test device could not be used.
Tests, followed by the quarantine of positive people who were exposed to contact with positive SARS-CoV-2 people, provided positive results.
The occupation that works in the city of Vao Italy, the first location of death due to COVID in Italy, did two rounds of testing on all populations made up of 3,400 people, by the distance of about 10 days.
About half of the positive people have no symptoms, and all the cases found in quarantine.
With the restrictions of the journey to this community, new infection is completely removed.
With aggressive contact tracking, traffic restrictions, tests, and quarantines, 2020 / 2020 medals in Singapore are expanding much slower than other advanced countries without extreme restrictions, such as the closing of restaurants and the reclusion firms.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore suggested that people live in the house on March 28, but the schools have been opened in time after the vacation on March 23.
Some other countries also handle pathistics with aggressive contact tracking, narrowing in, testing, and quarantine, but with unsighted territories, such as arthritis and South Korea.
A statistics study found that more countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a far lower risk rate of cases, perhaps because these countries are more capable of detecting people who have mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommend that countries that do not have testing capacity, and national labs with limited COVIDS experience, send five positive samples of COVID-19 first and ten negative samples to one of the 16 bacteria to confirm.
Of 16 reference labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following bar, column "%a positive result of testing" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
The country that only tests people who are treated at the hospital will have %’s positive results above the country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors.
Washing hands, which are also mentioned with hands, is the act of cleaning the hands of someone who intends to take away the dirt, oil, microorganism, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistent in "a certain critical time" during the day prevents preaching many illnesses, such as here and collera, which is transmitted through a qual-oral route.
People can also be affected by respiratory disease, such as the influence of a den or the cold, if they don't wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Five critical times during the very important day to wash hands with soap are: before and after throwing big water, after cleaning up a child’s ass or changing a diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before preparing food or running meat, fish, or raw advances.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after the meal.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning the kid who just used the toilet.
After cleaning up the nose, cough, or wash.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical cleanliness refers to the practice of hygiene associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is cleaning hands from pathogens, viruses, or other microorganism that can cause disease and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in medical areas, but it is also an important practice for the public.
Shopping has a lot of health benefits, including improving the preaching of the disease, the coronary virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing disease causes; reduce respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality of the baby at home.
The study conducted in 2013 revealed that the fruitage of the practice can increase the growth of the young boy.
In developing countries, child mortality rates can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate of the disease to nearly 50%.
Interventions that encourage the washing of hands can reduce the dre cases of such a third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low - production areas.
48% of the here cases can be linked to washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent the quadre and met respiratory infections, as the low behavior done at home, school, and the community all over the world.
Pneumonia, which is the primary ISPA, is the cause of the number one child death; this disease causes some 1.8 million children per year.
Diane and pneumonia cause almost 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making hands wash with soap before eating and after using the toilet is a way of saving more lives over vaccines or any medical action, and reducing death to nearly half and dying of my respiratory infections to a quarter.
Washing hands is usually coupled with other sanitation actions as part of the water program, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).
Washing hands also protects themselves from the three - wheeled amplifying in direct physical contact.
The effect of small washing hands is hand washing that is often done can cause skin damage because of skin production.
The survey that was done in 2012 in Denmark found that washing your hands overtensively can lead to balstal and fun skin conditions, known as an exim or helpful hand, which especially occurs among health officials.
Washing hands too often is seen as one of those obsessed disorders (OCDs).
There are five hours of critical days when washing hands with soap are important to reduce fecal disease, which is: before and after using toilets (exploding, dumping, low water), after cleaning the child’s ass ass ass, before eating the child, before eating and / after preparing food or fishing, fish, or aggres.
Another important thing to apply proper washing techniques to prevent disease poisoning is before and after taking care of wounds; after a cough, or blow off the nose; after touching animal shit or dealing with animals; and after touching the trash.
In many lands, the level of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38 different houses of laundering their hands with soaps. A study of the 2014 Arabia has the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States is almost in the middle of 77 percent; and China is at the low rate with 23 percent, now some of the behaviors are available to improve behavioral behaviors in the hands of soap when it is critical in the hands of the country.
Medical Health Programme applied to the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a practical exercise to support children’s health and education.
A worm medicine gift twice a year, plus washed hands every day with soap and brushed teeth every day with fluorides, is the core of this national program.
The program has also been applied in Indonesia.
The microorganism cleansing of the skin is strengthened with soaping or deservation to water.
The main work of soap and detergent is to reduce barriers to late and improve lateness.
It's just that water's not efficient skin cleaning because of fat and protein, which is an organic waste component, it's not easy to slow down in water.
In spite of that, fat cleansing and protein were helped by enough water flow.
Stubs solid, because of its potential reuse, they may contain bacteria that have been discovered from earlier usage.
A small number of studies that study the bacteria flow of solid soap conclude that transfers may not occur because bacteria are attached to the bus.
Even so, the CDC continues to say "the drop of the container without being touched more like it."
The antibiotics are greatly encouraged to health - conscious society.
Until now, there has not been evidence that the use of antisiptics or the presence that is recommended better for organisms that hold antibiotics in nature.
However, antibatteri soap contains general antibakeration agents such as tricks, which have a list of highly managed organisms.
So, even if the antibiotics can't be targeted by antibakeri soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is.
In addition to acid, acidic acids and skin protective substances, sophisticated form can contain acid (atracetic acid, acid, latactic acid) as a pH, suplobe acid as active antiicide, and new skin surfaces.
Warm water comfortable to wash hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Blatteri grows faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm water is more effective than with cold water dines in eliminating natural oil that holds shit and bacteria.
However, leaving behind with the belief of many people, scientific studies show that the use of hot water has no effect in reducing microbas in hand.
Hand or anacetication of hand is a water - based clean agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand - cleaning agents were known as alcohol - based alcoholics (also called alcohol - based strands, antipsics, or hand - controlrs).
Most of these clean - clean agents are based on alcohol isopropie or intol that is based together with the advertising materials such as Carbomer (acryer acid) to be glacerin or to be easily used and to reduce the effect of drying off alcohol.
The smoke of hydrogen results in further antimicroba activity, which contains at least 6095% alcohol is an efficient Kuman killer.
Raccinated alcohol poisoning kills bacteria, bacteria that stand against many drugs (MRSA and VREE), tuberculosis bacteria, several viruses (about HIV, herpes, RSV, rhovinus, vaccinininia, densia, and calcium), and fungi.
The alcohol poisoning that contains 70% alcohol kills 99,9 loyal log failure, similar to 35 decibels) bacteria in the hands of 30 seconds after use and 99,99% to 99,99% (exploding log to 4 5) bacteria in the hands of one minute after the use. The handle of bacteria is less effective and less effective toward several viruses.
Alcohol - based interventions are nearly effective for nonrovirus virus (or Norfulk), the most common cause for toxic gastrics. Antispnotizing hands or alcohol users in adequate amount should be used to heat or cover two hands altogether.
The front and back of two hands and in the cells and the end of all those fingers were carved around 30 seconds to fluid, bus, or dry logs.
The fingers must also be washed well by rubbing them in two lines, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are more likely to suggest the washing of the hand instead of the scission, especially when the hands look dirty.
Instead of using the use of the detective agent for quick use and activity of homicide against microorganism; however, research agents should not be used as a substitute for proper washing hands, except soap and water are not available.
Alcohol - based amputation can often cause the skin to dry, unless immolyen and/or skin spraying is added to the formula.
The effect to dry from alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other emolyen to formula.
In linis tests, alcohol - based interventions that contain emolynic lead to envy and skin droughts are much lower than soap and antimicroba plants.
Aggressive contact contact contact contact syndrome, or hypertenstability to alcohol or perversity in alcohol detectors rarely occur.
Lower spirit causes damaging contact to appeal to this product’s appeal compared to washing your hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't clear their hands from organic matter, but they're just infected.
For this reason, hand cleaning is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still in their hands.
The complexity of alcohol-free intervention depends on the materials and deformity, and, according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol abuser.
Recently, the formulation that uses cerzalcondes have proved to have a constant antimicroba activity that is frequently and complicated after the use, not like alcohol, which has proved to be reduced after repeated use, probably because of a progrresive side reaction.
Many people in low - production communities are unable to buy soap and use ashes or dust in exchange for it.
Abu or land may be more effective than water but less effective than soap.
One of the things that worry about is, if mixed up with microorganism, land, or ashes may increase the spread of disease over-sharve.
Like soap, ashes are also deinfect agents because, if contact with water, ashes will form alcalines.
WHO recommends ashes and sand as alternative soap when soap is not available.
The true washup technique based on the U.S. Center of Disease Control for the prevention of disease includes the following steps:
Hands of warm water or freezing cold water.
Water flows in motion because common, secret bus may be contaminated, whereas water temperature seems to have no effect.
The bus will be handed with a lot of soap, including the backs, in the fingers, and under my nails.
Sabun lifts nails from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when they use it only.
Check at least for 20 seconds.
Rotsing into a scaffling, which helps remove skin mites, and rub it longer than it takes.
It's carefully covered under the flow of water.
Floating inside the coms can make the hands break back.
Dry with dry laps or let it dry in the air.
Wet hands and mumps are easier to reconnect. An area that is often missed is thumbs, wrists, parts between fingers, and under nails.
The designed nails and the dried-up paint can save microorganism.
Steeping stability is often required to keep hands dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
The choice of low - cost options can be made to enhance hands when water is measured and/ or soap is not available, for example, flowing water from supergens or bottles that are hung and put in a hole or use, if necessary, in developing countries. In a state of limited water supply (like schools or rural areas in the country), there is a solution of water, such as "impy and other options are low-plicides," or other options.
Keran tippy is a simple technology that uses a water bottle hung with ropes, old hair operated by legs to pour some water into the hands, and a soap.
Effective hand control is an important part of the operation of hand cleaning, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand production in the general toilet.
The more study shows that paper laps are much cleaner than the power dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008 a study by Westminster University, London, and the European paper industry sponsored by the more modern jet - day Europective paper industry, to compare paper - bearing levels of cleanness, warm air filtering, and air drying.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, the total number of bacteria found to increase an average of 194% in finger books and 254% in the palm of hand.
Drying with jet air filters caused a total number of content bacteria average 42% in fingers and 15% in the palm of hand.
After washing and drying up with paper laps, the total number of bacteria reduces average 76% in fingers and 77% in the palm of hand. Illmuwan also tried to test the potential of cross-in-laws on other toilet users and toilet environments as a result of each type of filtering methods.
jet air filters, which remove air from the unit at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/hours), are able to blow microorganism from hand and unit and potentially corrupt other toilet users and environments up to two feet [2 m].
The use of warm air controls spread microorganism to 0.25 meters from drying.
Paper paper does not show significant microorganism. In 2005, in a study conducted by T malbadoV Produt und Ummwet, various methods of hand - awareness.
After hand drying, changes of the following bacteria are observed:
There's a lot of handews, and hand dryers have been compared to paper sheeting.
Putting hands on hand tissue is alternative to traveling if there's no soap and water.
Alcohol - based intervention must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical intervention was required far after Ignaz Semmelweis discovered his efficiency (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide bait to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection went down with the device's use.
Medical signatures were done for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in many or logs to sink and rub up every piece of hand.
Hands should be drawn to each other with each other's fingers.
If there's shit under my nails, feathers can be used to remove it.
Because I can survive in the water that is in hand, the hand needs to be carefully carved and spread with clean magic.
After dry, paper laps are used to shut off the water clearing (and open the exit if necessary).
This act avoids recontamination of the surface.
The purpose of washing hands in health care is to remove the microorganism of pathogens.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of washing hands is still at a rate that cannot be accepted in most medical areas, with a large number of doctors and nurses continue to wash their hands before touching patients so that microorganism is contagious.
One study showed that washing right hands and other simple procedures can lower the rate of blood flow related to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published pages that show the standard of washing hands and kindness in health care sectors.
The U.S. concept of hygiene can also be seen on its Web site for public comments.
The relevant feature of Whitby's et al.
Coscil devices can measure and clean hands if obedience signs are needed.
The World Health Organization has the time to wash hands:
after exposure to blood/ body fluid
before the task is accepted, and
After the patient's treatment. Antiseptic chemicals to soap (a "tip" or "antimicroba") are used to kill handwashing.
The function of the kill may be desired before performing a surgeon or in a situation when an organism that survives antibiotics is very common. For 'to strike' hands before surgical surgery, it is needed to be turned and shut down without touching, imaxedins or yodemum, humic magic to dry your hands after washing, and the sility to wipe me.
All jewelry must be released.
This procedure has washed their hands and arms down to the elbows, usually 2–6 minutes.
An old hour of talk is not necessary.
When the water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After it's done washing hands, hands are melted out with a silent cloth and a wearer’s garment.
To reduce mman’s preaching, it's better to wash hands or to use hand transplants before and after dealing with sick people.
For the management of Chinese staff infection in the hospital, found that the biggest benefits of cleaning hands came from the first 20% of washing, and that extra benefits were obtained very little when hand cleaning frequency increased over 35%.
Conversing with soap leads to more than three times as much per second as an infection in food poisoning than washing with antibakeric soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol - based interventions to reduce the virus of A H11 and Clostridium made from hand-offium. Intervensi to improve the hands of health - care workers may involve education for the staff to wash their hands, improve alcohol - based supplies, and lyrics to staff.
More research is required to learn the most effective intervention in various health - care settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic way that costs them to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, lack of reliable water supply, soap, or cleaning facilities in homes, schools, and jobs making targets to achieve universal washing behavior became a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, handwashings near private toilets or general toilets rarely exist, although options are available to make low - pitched laundry.
In any case, the low level of hand washing may also occur because of a already rooted habit, not because of lack of soap or water.
The urge and encouragement to wash your hands with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hands, and produce long - term population behavior.
To be effective, oversight and evaluation required.
A systemic review of 70 studies found that an effective community - based approach in raising hands in LMIC, while the social marketing campaign was not effective. One example of the help - cutting of the students at school is "The Three Stars" by UNICEF who pushed schools to take simple steps and cheaply clean up the facilities, in order to make the students wash their hands with soaps, among other standards.
When minimum standards are accomplished, school can move from one star to the end of three stars.
Building a handwash can be part of a washing campaign that is done to reduce child disease and death.
The World Hand Day is another example of the increased awareness campaign that attempts to reach the purpose of behavior change, resulting in 201920 - 2020 [192020] virus, UNICEF has encouraged handwashing.
Some studies studied the cost of washing their hands all over the developing countries in connection with the Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the missing years.
One survey shows that encouraging handwashing with soap is a significantly more expensive cost of water intervention and other sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as the mother who gave birth or wounded soldiers in the hospital, first known in the middle of the middle of the 19th century by the hands of two brokeers: A Hungarian physician Igzaz Sememeis who works in Wina, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, who was present in Britain.
At that time, many people still believe that infection is caused by the foul smell called misma or bad air.
In the 1980s, a plague that was generated through food and infection associated with health care made the Centers for Control and Prevention of the United States more actively to clean up hands as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The plague of pigs in 2009 and COVID expressed in 2020 increased consciousness in many countries would need to wash your hands with soap to protect themselves from the disease.
For example, posters were hung on the washboard of the hands in the public toilet and in the toilet building and the airport in Germany.
The expression "hands out of" means that a person's reluctance to be responsible for something or to get involved in something.
The expression comes from the Bible chapter of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hand on the decision to discredit Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash his hands constantly to clean an imajiner stain; an act that showed his guilt for the crime he committed and had persuaded her husband to do it.
And it has also been known that when they remember or meditate on illicit actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and appreciate more of the equipment washed their hands.
Moreover, those who were left behind after these meditation have smaller scars involved in "washed", such as volunteer.
Religion commands washing hands for clean and symbolic purposes. A symbolicing of the hands, using water, but without soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual washing hands in many religions, including Bahá'í, Hindu, tevilatah, and Zavabo in Jews, and Wudhu in Islam.
Religion of Hindus, Jews, and Islam made arrangements for washing their hands after using toilets.
Also, the religion of Hindus, Buddhas, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam involved washing their hands before and after eating.
The danger control of the work area for COVID-19
The danger control of the work area for COVID-19 is a safety Metodology and health-todology application for danger control for the prevention of coronary 2019 (COVID) disease.
The right danger control at work depends on the location of work and job work, based on the risk of higher sources, the risk rate of disease in the community, and the risk of each of the workers who may be vulnerable to the COVID 19th.
According to U.S. Security and Health Administration, low - risk work has minimal work contact with public work and other workers; for this job, recommended basic precautions, which include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay home if they are ill, breathing, and doing cleaning and living in a routine environment.
The risky job of paparan is to include the work that requires close contact or often with an unknown person who has not known or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but it may be infected with the effect in the current society or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with common people as they do at school, the working environment with high population ties, and high volume order.
The danger control for this group, besides the steps of basic infection, include the vents using high - efficient air filters, protective against the strands, and providing protection tools when encountering the CIVIDS.
DOOS consider health power and body bedrooms covered in a known or expected to suffer from COVID is a risk of high paparan, which is greatly at high risk if workers do aerocing procedure on, or take or handle speculations from, people who are known or expected to suffer from COVID.
The right danger control for this worker includes engineering control, such as negative correlation space, and self - protective devices that fit the job.
COVID-19 can have some impact on the workplace.
Humans may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or because of fear of the possibility of exposure.
Business patterns can change, both in such things as requested and how to get these things (like shopping out of hours, through delivery, or incoming).
Finally, sending material shipments from a very close-of-the-art geography area can be disturbed.
The article considers the risk rate associated with different workplaces and jobs, including the sources of the papal, the risk factors that arise from home fathers and society, and the risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also described the control required to deal with that risk and emergency plan for situations that might arise as a result of the outbreak.
Kesiaptions and plans of infectious disease may submit to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of the outbreak includes reducing control among staff, protecting people who are more risky for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and creating bad effects on other entrys in the supply.
The rise of disease in the community of business is affecting the actions of recursion.
The risk control of danger is a labor frame that is used in safety and working health to bring in danger control based on its effectiveness.
If COVID-19 danger cannot be removed, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative engineering, and the final protective tool itself.
technical control includesolating employees from the dangers associated with work without relying on the working behavior and can be the most efficient solution it costs to apply.
Administrative management is a change in policy or procedure that requires both the work force and the worker’s work.
Self - protection devices (APD) are considered less effective than engineering and administrative management, but they can help prevent some papal parts.
All types of APD are to be selected based on the danger of workers, set up properly as did (empirator), be consistent and correct, examined, treated, and replaced frequently, if necessary, and removed, and kept properly, or removed.
According to U.S. Security and Health Administration, low - risk work has minimal work contact with public and other employees.
Steps of basic infections that are recommended for all workplaces include washing often, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory ethics include covering up rocks and pans, providing tissues and garbage containers, preparing for work from a long distance or time off with arrivals, if necessary, giving them no tools and equipment, and maintaining the environment.
Quick and isolation to potential individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employees with disease symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free from fever, symptoms of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using any known fever or other symptoms, and in order to allow workers to stay home to care for their family members, and work employees.
According to OSHA, risky work involves work that requires close contact or often within six feet (1.8 m) with unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19-CoV2, but it may be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 because of the effect on society around business, or because someone new has made international trips to an international location with a vast CODIVVIVVV.
This group includes the workers who have contact with the common people as they do at school, the working environment with high population populations, and high volume-end mode settings. Such techniques for this group and high-speed groups include putting up high air filters, increasing stress levels, developing the physical resistance, and setting up the physical resistance of the field service, and setting up a field service for the attention of the workers, using a high-ending and a list of the list of self-offs, or an emergency attention and an emergency field.
The workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If someone gets sick on a plane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers involves separating sick people from another man by six feet, pointing one crew to take care of the sick, and offering a mask for sick people or asking him to close your mouth and nose when the stone has been covered with tissue.
You must wear medical gloves when caring for sick passengers or touching body fluids or potentially infected surfaces and perhaps other protective devices if a sick passenger suffers from fever, a constant cough, or breathing difficulty.
The gloves and other goods must be thrown into a life - threatening bag, and the outer surface must be cleared and contaminated after it. For commercial voyages, including fishing ships and other passengers, danger control involves delaying a journey if it is sick, isolated, and informing the medical center of the ship immediately if someone has a fever or some other symptoms on the ship.
The Ideal, the new medical treatment was done in the private cabin of people who were isolated from preaching in the community, for school and child care facility, CDC recommends short-term closings to clean or infected if people who have been infected in the school building.
If there is tension in society at the minimum level of the world, social diversity strategy can be applied, which includes leaving field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as the physical education, a choir class, or a diet of music, increasing distance between the table, time coming and gradually, restricting total visitors, and using the office location of health for children to be separated.
If there is a high tension in the local society, on the side of social diversity strategy, extended school closings can be considered for law enforcement who perform daily routine, the risk of health is directly viewed as low by the CDC.
A law enforcement officer who has to make contact with a confirmed or unexpected COVIDian is recommended to follow the same guidance as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate personal protective tools.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers have to clean up and infect the belts and task gears before using again by using the receptacle or household cleaning and following standard operation procedures to control and throw off used and control and wash dirty clothes.
DOOS consider health energy and certain morgues to be a high - risk category or very high level.
High - risk job includes health care, support, labs, and the energy of medical transportation covered with known or expected COVID.
This job is at high risk if workers perform aerosol procedure procedure on, or take or handle speculations from, known or suspected COVID-19.
Aerosol processing procedure includes inturation, coil procedure, bronkoskopi, a number of procedures and tooth examinations, or a presupposion.
The operating job of a high-structuation field included the workers involved in preparing a dead or expected COVIDS case at the time of death; this job was extremely high if workers were engaged. Additional techniques for the risk of this group include space for patients who were known or suspected COVID-day cases, include when the successful procedure is performed.
A negative negative pressure control may be appropriate in some health care order and body room.
The perception must be handled by the level level level level levelage level of Biology three.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to be separated into a different waiting room based on whether they were thought to be the COVID case. Besides other APDsA recommend respirators for those who work within six feet of known patients or expected to be infected by SARS-CV-2, and those who do successful do the procedure.
In the United States, cover respirator of N95 approved NISH or better must be used in the context of written respiratory protection program and interpretation that involves testing, training, and medical checkups.
Another type of respirator can provide a bigger protection and increase workers' comfort.
WHO has just recommended surgical masks for screening officers at the entrance point.
For those who take respiratory specimens, care, or transport the COVID patients without aeroding procedures, WHO recommend surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, clothing, and gloves.
If aerosol procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with the N95 respirator of N95 or FFP2.
In view that APD supply is not sufficient throughout the world, WHO recommend an APD needs for an APD through remote medical services, physical restrictions like a window of sight, with only someone involved in medical care to enter the room with a CLID patients, using only APD needed for a specific task, continuing to use the same respirator without taking care of many patients with a diagnosis, and monitoring the process without any symptoms.

JABIS SUBJEK: [Covident] Cut the load down and prepare the future
TANGGAL/time: March 14th 2020, 00:24 UTC
CHENICE: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in such a wonderful situation this month.
The COVID article is that makes clear global human activity and the responsibilities that we have each other.
We have never faced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on our empathy, work, and global community development, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and care we've been witnessing among all fellow workers through emails, calls, and chats is incredible evidence of incredible human beings, which we're pretty lucky, to work with them.
My gratitude and pride can hardly be called you both partners.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how important it is to the present world to access Wikipedia and how this is a strong symbol for this important resources to remain available to everyone.
Your job allows this to happen, whether you keep this site running, help pay for our partner, or help to preserve the security of our community.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially now.
This is the moment when it's not just the work we're doing, but the way we do it, it's gonna make an impact that means to the world.
Since the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenge we've faced and the best way of caring for the organization's survival all along this time.
We really want to remove pressure and support our mission for a long term.
If you need to reduce the job schedule, it's okay.
For all the staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set off days, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
But the world can't be interpreted right now, and either you need to care for loved people, shopping for a subject, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't monitor your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't be said, but we're saying it.
The illness or PTO is not necessary, enough to tell your manager and help your team to run the calendar and schedule to ensure the main field of work can be completed.
(If positive you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell BryanC Ops in order to help with the support and make sure that your situation gets the right attention of management).
His payouts will be fully paid.
We've said it, and said it once again, to honor our commitment to our contractors and an hour-based staff staff.
Everyone will be paid according to their work hours when they are normal.
It includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress against the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in these days.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
A certain job is considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, SDM operations, trust & Security, and the Dance team, among other things, doing important work that may need additional support.
We're going to start a process with all departments to judge the current destination and distract our focus to support the essentials for our mission.
There's much to do for all of us, we'll just focus fully on the most essential project.
Slowing down this time won't be anything for the future.
We're not planning on running late after this academy passed.
You won't be expected to work late to fulfill an unrealistic time term right now.
We realized that things changed and would try to set new targets and lines if necessary.
What about an APP (Digrenary plan)?
To adjust to new reality and awareness of daily work hours, we mean to adapt the time line for the 202020202021 Yearbook production.
We mean to propose a 2019-20 plan that allows more time to make budgets so that employees can be able to make an important job, care, and care for the loved ones while they need or want to work with a little schedule for the next couple weeks.
This length of time is greatly reduced to the weight of work and planning pressure now throughout the organization.
We'll deliver our proposal to the next week's council and we'll update delegates and teams on next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, paparan, and clean the office
Last week, we were told that one of our associates based on SF may have been exposed to the COVIDC virus.
However, being very worried, we hired an effective cleaning crew to infect all surfaces in San Francisco's office.
They're using the slow fluid of a hospital to infect every surface, lobi, and all the elevators that access our floor.
The building applies its own safety ensure protocol by using products that support its preservation.
We're glad that the office will be ready to be used when we decide to return.
Our D.C.'s office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVIDian protocols to us and all members of the staff based in D.C.
From last week, our D.C.'s office has moved to a distant working order, along with guidance shared with San Francisco.
As it was known by some of our associates who were based on the NYC, we were also discussing hiring the location in Brooklyn.
It's still continuing, but it might be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Our longtime partner is aware that it may take adjustments and they want to offer you some advice:
The limit for the longer one or two hours of meeting.
If more sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into a few days.
Define a meeting clearly, built an agenda, and sent publications previously.
Make a video as default, with a device like Google Docs and Zoom to redegracizing and direct connections.
Show the leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and record the speaker list, and someone to help make a meeting record (or do the work records).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy some small food.
Join the #remotices channel in Slack to talk to your partner about the shared job
The SSM operations are looking for webinary guidance to support the increase of the work that is distributed throughout the Foundation.
Most of the week we asked all the citizens of the community to cancel a public event held by Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHOO has ended.
We told them that we understood our request for revocation and other restrictions could make them impossible to complete approved action and that no one would be given pinaltis because of delay or modifying the target.
The next week we're going to follow up with an additional guide on Wikimania and the conference of the regional community and other themes.
Commonly, the sentiment of the entire global community seems to be the grief of this disorder, but as a relief from clarity and the ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Next, CRT is trying to prepare the page in Met-Wiki to provide room for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send you an invitation to your calendar for the next Thursday, at 1200 C.E./07: PT to a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share an additional update, answer your questions, and spend time with each other.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all the essential information related to the COVID 19th class at Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also try to keep regular communication with staff living in countries that are now more significant.
If you have questions about travel, events, major worklines, or difficulties about lips, or other things that may need help, don’t hesitate to tell and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and become connected to needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global SSM International.
None of this changes are seen as our job fulfillment and duty.
Rather, this change is a confession that, at present, our jobs and obligations may need to be adapted in ways that we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we assure each other to support in these situations so that we can keep working, provide the support we need, and give the world of service that they rely on.
The work we planned before will be there awaiting us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create room for important work that will come in a few weeks and maybe a few months to come.
We need you all to bring it up, for it, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work as well as when it is needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Enzim changer Drysin 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity contrary to the enzymes of the angiotensin development (AC), by reducing the number of angiotensin-II and raising Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a goal to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE is also a point in the cell for some of the crowns.
ACE2 human versions are often called hACE2.
The dystrectator Drysin 2 is a metoloenzim containing a sng on the surface of edotel cells and other cells.
ACE2 protain has M2 terminal-N domainspose domain and amnoly typical acid domain colloctrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single - type membrane protein I, with active domains on the surface of the cell in the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 extrasel ACE2 separated from other enzymes, known as sheddase, and the main protein was released into the blood stream and was finally exposed into the urin.
ACE2 is in most organs: ACE2 attached to a cell membrane mainly a type of lung stem cells II, small intestine cells, arteries and veins, and artery muscles in most organs.
The ACE2 expression was also found in the sebral court, striats, hips, and brain trunks.
ACE2 main function is as ACE developer.
ACE broke down the angiotensin hormone I became a angiotensin II vanocontriciction.
Finally, ACE2 cut melancin acid Amino nymlanlanin terminalskongs of the angiotensin II (Ap-Syg-Vynal-Vyrle-HIs-Pres-Prohe) and resciliscin became Drytensin (H-Sy-Sy-Ag-Ag-F-F-F-F-EPro-HI-H-HI-H-H-HI-HI-H-H-H-H-HI-I-HI-I-H-I-H-I-H-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-I-F-F-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I.).).).
ACE2 can also split a number of other perceptions include [des-Ag9] -bradiine, applein, neurotensin, dinophin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also arranged traffic between amino acidic transmissions neutral SLC6S19 and involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmocran protein, ACE2 functions as the main entry point in the cell for several crowns, which include HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (CARS caused SARS).
More specific, protein bonding S1 on cheats or tons of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with an ACE2 domain on the surface of the cell results in endotosis and translocate viruses and enzymes into the edosm located inside the cell.
This virus entry process also requires protein calcing S by the TMPRS2, which his servants are currently investigating as potential therapists, that fact makes the ACE2 drop in a cell might help fight infection.
However, many professional societys and regulations recommend further ACE and standard RAB therapy.
A systematic survey and metanianis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "inhibitor ACE has caused a significant rise of 34% in pneumonia risk compared with control."
In addition, "inhibitor iCE's immune use also lowers the risk of pneumonia on patients who have a higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients stroke and heart failure.
ACE's use of the ACE's use is also linked to fatality related to Pneumonia, although the result is less powerful than the risk of the overall Pneumonia."
ACE2 humans recomputed (URCE2) are expected to be new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to raise hemodinic lungs and a unit of oxygen on pigs with a mic disorder produced by scipplicide syndrome.
Time of rhSCE2 on humans about 10 hours with awarded 30 minutes of work but a 24-hour effect.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a cure promising for patients with tolerance of system-in-angteninininsininins (inhibitor RA) or in a classic disease with 18,tensinus II in the increase of blood circulation.
b'AptiS COVID-199 is a mobile software application designed to help contact tracking contact to cope with the 20-20th coronary navigation exam, which is the process of identifying people "constroduct" that may have already made contact with infected people.
Many applications are developed or passed, which have official government support in some areas and jurisdiction.
Some working shells to build contact tracking applications have been developed.
The issue of questionable privacy, especially related to the system based on the application user's geographic location tracking.
An incentive that doesn't break privacy includes the use of Bluetooth signal to record the user's approach with another cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple share together announce that they're going to invest functions to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and the ISS's operating system.
In China, Chinese government, along with Alipay, has spread applications that allow citizens to check if they have contacted the COVID patients.
This application is used in over 200 Chinese cities in Singapore, using applications called TraceTagether.
This application is developed by local communities, released as a source open and delivered to the government. The North Macedonia launch "StopKona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track the papal on infected people and provide a quick response to health care.
This application is developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and Health Service.
Until April 1420, the application is still waiting for Google Play Storme and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that contact tracking applications are being in further development and will be available to spread in a few weeks. similar applications were planned in Ireland and in France "StopCovid."
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTagether application of Singapore and Blue Torace protocols. Russia means to introduce a geofenic application for patients who live in Moscow 19th-century patients who live in Moscow; this application is designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Camridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur on application-based systems, which include false positive and potentially lack of effectiveness if data is taken limited on only a small portion of the population.
To overcome concern about the spread of the "coronavirus" application which is misleading or dangerous, Apple sets limits on the kind of organization that can add a contributorrus application to App Store, which is restricted only to the organization of "resmi" or who has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply similar restrictions.
The privacy supporters voiced their concern about perplanciation applications using the coronary application, especially as to whether the surveyal poisoning is made to handle the coronaryemia will cease after the threat passes.
Amesty International and over 100 other organizations have issued a statement that calls for boundaries on this kind of survey.
This organization expresses eight requirements for government projects:
surveys have to be "the law measure, needs, and proportional";
The need for delay and survey must have set sun schedule;
data use must be restricted for COVID-19 purpose;
security and anonymity of data must be protected and proved to be protected by evidence;
The digital survey must avoid the worse of discrimination and the Marginalization;
Every data division with the third side must be defined in laws;
has to be protected against abuse and rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
The part meaning is "all relevant interest" required, which includes society’s health experts and the world's best social group. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and German Reports Without Borders (ReportOne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued a list of checks.
Google/Apple plans are being proposed for overcoming survey problems constantly by removing the tracking mechanism from the device's operating system after it's not necessary.
Some countries use network-based tracking, and not applications, so eliminate applications and skills to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network - based pollution that has access to raw location data has a significant potential for privacy problems.
But not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; a number of systems protecting privacy have been created and used only for intercomnication (see the bottom).
In South Korea, an application system is used for contact tracking.
In exchange for using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications through text messages to people who are potentially infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made the information available to the public, which is allowed with extensive changes in data - privacy laws after MERS’s decline in the country.
This information is available to general through a number of applications and web sites. countries such as Germany are considered to use a system that protects privacy.
Until April 620, the details haven't been released.
In April 7, 2020, more than groups of experts are working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooh Lawgy (BLE), with a large number of research liters from at least 2013, to record the presence of users with other mobile phones.

That means that these vaccines can have beneficial benefits beyond his preventive diseases.
Test further land track in Australia, trying to follow 4.170 health officials.
There's a possibility that vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research for assessing vaccines in a 3-year-old brain model, such as the ACE2-transgenic mouse, other lab animals, and non-human primates, shows the need for reservation steps to achieve bio security levels in life control of the virus, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaks against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal model.
Until 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines for SARS that prove safe and effective on humans.
According to the study published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat the SARS are the priority for government and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS is a prevalent, the SARS study that is believed to be a template that is useful to develop vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infection.

Social media posting has favored a conspiracy theory that claims the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccine has been available.
The Pattens that are quoted by various social media posts refer to the extensions that exist for genetic drieders and vaccines to receive other coronalvirus, like the SARS.
b'B'llvirus 2019 (COVID-19) is infectious disease caused by heavy respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Public symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, dire, throat pain, loss of smell, and stomach disease.
The time from being exposed to the awitan symptoms in mostly about five days, but it can be ranging from two to twelve days.
Although most cases result in light symptoms, some developed into virus Pneumon and failed the monjemuk organ.
Until April 1720, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and initorial regions, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. This virus is particularly spreading human contact when it comes to close contact, often through the tiny sparks or fragments produced through coughs, Faith, or speaking.
Despite the results of breathing, the blast usually falls to the ground or to the surface and is not contagious to the distance.
People can also be infected with touching the infected surface and touching the eyes, noses, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is highly contagious for the first three days after the awitan symptoms, although the message may occur before symptoms occur and after the next disease. The standard diagnosis is the reaction to real-time polymeration chain in use of nasofing.
The use of masks is recommended for people who are expected to be infected with viruses and people who care for them.
The review of the use of masks by the public is different; some authorities recommend not to use maskers, some recommend use, and others demand their use.
Right now, there's not a vaccine or a specific alternative for COVID.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in nearly all countries in six WHO region.
A person infected with a virus can be without symptoms or symptoms like flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing.
An emergency symptoms include breathing, pain, or constant pain in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, face or face or lips; medical tension is immediately advised if these symptoms appear.
The above breathing symptoms, such as scisssion, insults, or sore throat pain can be found but rarely occur.
The effects of gastroinsinll, such as mual, vomit, and dre, are observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China at first were only with a clinic image of chest and speech.
In some people, sickness can develop into pneumon, failure to bejemuk organ, and death.
It's called intestine time.
The immuration period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can cover from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who are sexually infected will experience symptoms in 11.5 days of infection.
This unbelievable heir in the effects is not fully known; yet, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Right now, the exports of infected people who don't show the symptoms and are being diagnosed, with Korea’s Control Center and Prevention (CDC) report that 20% of all cases are confirmed without symptoms during hospital treatment.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include cases without symptoms in its daily cases on April 1; from 166 infection that day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms during testing.
Sputum and water can carry virus loads on a vast scale.
Speaking out loud releasing more sparks or pieces than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that a stone that was not covered could have caused the volt to be moved to ten feet [4.5 m] in length.
Although this virus is usually not operated by air, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences shows that bioerosol transmissions may occur and air stations stationed in the hallways outside the room of people produce a positive sample for the virus services.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cervation of the lung heart (RJP), can make the rate of breathing turn into aerosol and then spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through fetuses, this risk is believed to be lower. The most contagious virus is known when people are decisions, even though preaching may occur before symptoms arise, at low risk.
The European Center and Controls (ECDC) said that although this disease is not fully clear how easy it is to spread, one people generally infect two to three others.
In particular, it has been found that virus can be detected for one day on carton/kardus, for three days on plastics and rusty steel (AI 304), and for four hours at 99% of copper.
However, this varies according to the moisture and temperature.
Sabun and detergen are also effective if used properly; soap products parse the virus’s protective layer, decretion the virus, and free it from skin and other surfaces.
Another link, such as clarzalcondescinium and cactectin glut, is less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, the lour was taken in the median two days after the incast.
In five of six patients, the first sample showed the charge of the highest virus, and the sixth patient showed the burden of the highest virus on the test of the second day.
Coronaviral respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome, which is first isolated from three people with a pneumonium related to the reality of respiratory disease in Wect.
All features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are just on the new crownvirus in nature.
Outside the human body, this virus was killed by household soap, which broke his armor bubbles.
Parru is the most compatible organ of the COVID-19 because the virus accesss an immune cell through anzim remoderation 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in the type cell of II lung.
This virus uses special surface gladiators called "spikes or tons ofjolan" to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Minute heart girls were found at 12% of infected people who were treated in Ocean, Chinese, and more frequently in severe disease.
The rate of high cardiovascular symptoms because of systemic reactions and immunities during the development of disease, but miokard mookard injury may also be associated with the ACE2 receivers in the heart.
ACE2 rejectr is expressing very high in the heart and involved in the function of the heart.
The high population infection of the COVID infection in the IC and may be linked to bad prognois. Otosi for the dead because COVID was found the alvelaric damage infus (D) and the infroptation contained in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropicales for systemic cyclone cells that express ACE2, the SCIVID patients have heavy symptoms.
Specially, the T cells that make GM-CSF pathogenics prove to be coupled with a monocycycist who makes l-6 infology and severe lung pathological pathological pathology on patients of COVID.
Infitrate phyphystics have also been reported on autotositos.
WHO has applied some testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is the reaction of real-time polymerase chain (rRT-PRC).
This test is usually done on respiratory samples that are acquired through disophrering; however, samples of nasal or snails can also be used.
Mostly, results are available in hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but two blood samples were taken by two weeks to have a small amount of time.
Chinese trained scientists are able to isolate this coronary panvirus and apply genetic dry review so that labs around the world can develop the reactions of polymerase chain (PRR) independent to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4 2020, an antibodi test that can detect active infection and if someone's infected before) is in development, but it's not used much.
Chinese experience with the test shows only 60 to 70%.
FDA in the United States approved a test of first points in March 21, 2020 for use at the end of the month.
Opsity of ground-glas multilobarals with perversive distribution, asmmetrics, and posters found a lot at the beginning of infection.
The subpleural occupation, crazy pinging, and resurging can appear as a result of disease.
A little data available on microscopic lessons and COVID pathology.
The main pathological guests in the autoepsiology are:
Macroskopi: available disease, surgicallytics, lung consoles, and pulmonary edem
Four types of pneumon virus may die:
light pneumonia: edem pulmoner, pneumocytic hyperplatica, pneumocytes large atips, interstitive infration with slimphystic conversions, and form large-inated giant cells
heavy pneumonia: alveolar damage infus (DD) with alveolar alvelar infus.
DDA is the cause of acute breath syndrome.
pneumonia in recovery stage: Exuity control in alveolar and intertital lung
Blood: Intruptrological intrupta (DIC); a listening reaction
Prospective steps to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, cutting a good breathing cycle, and avoiding eye, nose, or mouthless hands.
The CDC recommended that close your mouth and nose with paper when or sink and recommend the use of part in my skin if tissue is not available.
Higiene's appropriate hand after the cough or he's encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of the cover of the face from the fabric in public places, some to limit the presence of people without symptoms. Social protocols are designed to reduce the contact of people who are infected with many, by the way to close schools and places, to limit travel, and to cancel large rates in public places.
Personal restrictions also include people guarding at least six feet or four feet [1.8 m].
There's not yet effective drug preventing COVID-19. Because the vaccine was expected to be there until early 2021, the main part in handling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "streating the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hand looks dirty, before eating, and after doing the nose, cough, or sink.
Further CDC recommends using alcohol - based dicisation that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.
In this form, antimicroba activity is derived from etol or inpropanol.
Hydrogen micide is used to help eliminate bacteria in alcohol; this substance is "not active for the antipsyps".
Gliseroll added as a hustan.
People are handled with support treatment, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support the rest of the vital organs.
CDC recommends people who expect them to carry a virus to use simple face masks.
The extrakoropeum membrane intervention has been used to cope with respiratory failure, but the benefits are still considered.
Cleanness and lifestyle and a healthy diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Suvisive treatment may be useful to people who have mild symptoms at the beginning of infection. WHOO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for dealing with Inapable COVID patients.
The intensive and U.S. medical personnel have formed treatment recommendations from various institutions to free resources, which is IBCC.
Until April 2020, there's not a specific treatment for COVID 19th.
For symptoms, some medical energy is more recommended parasedigols than the motherprofen for the first lini use.
The precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of viral vascular, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosol, such as intubation or hand vent.
For health skills that care for COVID-19s, the CD recommends putting that person in the Insolation Insoction-Udra (AIR) instead of using standard precautions, contact precautions, and stop preventive measures. CDC set guidelines for protection use (APD) during the Millennium.
The installation equipment is: APD's garment, respirator or face masks, eye protectors, and medical gloves. If available, respirator (not face masks) better.
N95 Respirator approved for industrial order, but FDA has corrupted this mask to use based on emergency Usage.
The N95 rejectr was designed to protect from an air particles such as dust, but the effect on certain biological agents is not guaranteed for non-reported use on labels.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection or, as the final attempt, the mask made by itself.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they need mechanical or alternative vents, but most of the case is really heavy.
The type of respiratory support for those who experience respiratory failure to breath related to COVID-19 is active for those who are treated inap, and there is evidence that intrication can be avoided with high - rate filters or local air salt pressure.
Haven't known whether either of these methods results in the same benefit to critical people.
Some doctors prefer to keep using mechanical vents when available, because this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles as opposed to high - high-level collals; more severe cases occur in older people over 60 years, and especially those who are over 80 years old.
Many developed countries have no adequate hospital bed, which restricts the health system capacity to handle suddenly the number of LOVID cases severe enough to require inaptation.
A study in Chinese found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support, and 14% died.
In China, about 30% of LOVIDT patients who were treated in the ICU.
Intributing measia becomes more complicated as the memory syndrome occurs (ARDS) in COVID-19 and oxygen is getting harder.
Ventators who are able to do pressure control mode and high PEP are required to reduce oxygen distribution and to minimize the risk of lung injury and pnemototracer related venerators.
The high PEP may not be available on old ventilation.
Research about the potential for treatment began in January 2020 and some analytic drugs are being tested.
Redesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take up to 2021, some drugs that are being tested are approved for other use or are already in further testing.
Drug can be tried on people with severe disease.
The volunteers that are recommended are participating in the WHOO and in testing the potential health and health security. FDA has granted temporary authorization for the convalence plasma as an experimental treatment in a person's life or at risk.
Convalesen's Square hasn't been conducted a clinical study required to prove security and incentive for this disease.
In February 20, 2020, Chinese launched mobile applications to handle this epidemic.
User is asked to enter their name and ID number.
This application is capable of detecting close 'conspective' using survey data so that it can detect the potential risk of infection.
Every user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential of risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self - denial, but also tells the local health officials. Alosures on cell data, facial identification technology, cell tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track down infected people and people who are in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 20, 2020, the government of Israel allowed the security body to track down a person's cell phone data that was presumed to be hit by a coronalvirus.
The step was taken to perform quarantine and protect people who might be contacted with infected citizens.
Moreover, in March 20, 2020, Deutsche Teektsom shared a telephone call call call to the German federal government's body, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the virus’s spread.
The Russians use facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was told that "40% of the citizens are still moving to places".
The German government did hackatathon last weekend 48 hours with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, makes a global call for creative solution against the message of the crownvirus.
People may experience pressure because of quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment effects, or fear of the infection itself.
BBC cites Rory O'Connor who says, "Dissing social isolation, loneliness, health care, stress, and economic collapse is a perfect storm that endangers the mental health and well - being of society."
This disease can take light with a little or without symptoms, which resembles the disease of breathing over other commons, such as pills.
The minor case is usually healed in two weeks, while those who suffer from severe or critical diseases may need three to six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for COVIDS infection that is heavy on data from a similar virus, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still low.
In the worst of people, COVID-19 can quickly grow into a acute respiratory syndrome that leads to respiratory failure, respiratory shock, or failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 including sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and hearts.
Other blood clots, especially the increase in protrombin time, are observed at 6% of LOVID patients treated in favor, while kidney function disorders are seen at 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 descriptions show the rise inzim of heart.
According to the same report, median time between awitan symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in an inaptation.
However, patients who were transferred to the ICU have a median period of seven days between instage and death.
In a study that studied early cases, median started from early symptoms to death is 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Chinese, men have a 2.8% death rate, while women have a number of deaths.
A hystopaologology sample of mailmortem shows an alveolar damage infus with cell - cellicity in both lungs.
The changes of the virus are observed in pneumocytes.
Outline images resemble acute breath syndrome (ARDS).
In 118% of deaths reported by Chinese National Health Commission, a dead heart damage, with a rise intropoponic levels or heart rate.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of treated people have a default condition; medical and economic resources supplies can also affect mortality.
The fatality of the condition varied because of the differences of the region, but also because of the difficulties of metodology.
Less counting of light cases can cause the death rate to be estimated too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean fatality at present is too low.
But smokers have possible 14 times more severe COVID symptoms and about 2.4 times more may need intensive care or die than is not a smoker.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a rate of lung capacity 20% to 30% in some people who recovered from disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause anti-intensive path syndrome after recovery.
Until March 20, 2020, it was not known that previous infection gave effective and long-term attention to people who were cured of this disease.
Imunity may be obtained, if you look at another coronary behavior, but it has been reported that the COVID original cure case followed by a positive visual test a few days after.
This case is believed to be a severe remaining infection, and it's not an infection.
This virus is thought to be natural and is from an animal, through spreading infections.
The real thing is not known, but by December 20, 2019, the spread of infection is nearly fully driven by the transmission of man to man.
A study of 41 cases confirmed the first COVID, published on January 20, 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the initial show date is December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported the earliest symptoms in December 8, 2019.
Mostly, some measurements are used to count deaths.
These numbers vary according to areas and at length, as well as under the number of tests, health care systems, treatment options, time from the first plague, and character of population such as age, sex, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO sets an ICD-10 emergency code of U07.1 for death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection that confirmed lab and U07.2 deaths for death due to the deaths of CVID or genocide without confirming lab infections for SAR-CV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, death ratio of global cases is 6,9% (153.82/240.191) by April 2020.
The number varied according to the region. The other size includes the fatality of cases (CFR), which reflect the percentage of people diagnosed with certain diseases, and the fatality of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (the diagnosis and not diagnosed) who died of certain diseases.
These statistics are not bound time and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodi, antibodi's existence can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In Italy's episode filter, Casttigone d'Adda, a small village with 46,000 citizens, 80 (,0.0) is dead.
In Gangelt, this disease is spread through the Karnaval festival, which is spreading among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and probably not all of the deaths of the COVID 19th century is classified as the death of COVID.
Furthermore, the German health system has not yet been overcome.
In the Netherlands, about 3% population may have antibodi, as we considered from blood donors.
69 people (0.004 percent of population) why this African dies because of COVID-19.
The academys and the mortality levels are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher to men in studies done in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with the risk of between a new man and a new woman doesn't appear at the age of 90.
In China, death number for a man at 2.8 percent and for women by 1.7 percent.
The reason for a difference based on this type of sex is unknown, but genetic and behavior may be an excuse.
Immunological differences based on sex, lower consumption of smoking on women, and men with debid conditions, such as hypertension, at younger age than women can contribute to a higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected people are men and 72% of the people who died because COVID-19 was men.
Until April 20, 2020, the U.S. government did not trace sex data for the COLID-19 infection.
Research shows that virus disease, such as Elacy, HIV, influencement, and SARS, affects men and women differently.
The sexiest health officer who is more than a female sexer, especially a nurse, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO Leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebrereesus explains that CO is short for corona, VI for viruses, D for disease, and 19 for the first possible outbreak: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a particular geographic location, a species of animals, or a group of people, as with international recommendations intended to prevent stigmatization. The virus that caused the COVID was named a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "COLID-19" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly called "coronavirus".
At the start of the outbreak of the plague, Chinese Chinese, virus, and this disease is commonly called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Ocean."
In January 2020, WHO recommends 2019-nCoV and respiratory disease at 1919-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to its influence 2015 to use no location in the name of disease and virus.
The official name of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on February 11, 2020.
Because of the limitations in standard supply chain, some digital producers print health supplies such as nasal and venerator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needs a real need for ventilator valves, and the mask can't provide it on a necessary time scale, a local company invented and printed 100 knots that are needed last night.
After the beginning of the COVID epidemic, conspiracy theory, false information, and deformizing the origin, scale, precautions, treatments, and other aspects of disease, spread rapidly from the distance.
Humans seem capable of spreading the virus to some other animals.
Sttudi failed to find evidence of repetiation virus on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID drugs is being done by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated "SOLIDEGY Trial" for reviewing the effects of the four-generation medical effects that already existed with the most promising honesty.
Vaksin is not available, but various institutions are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previously on SARS-CoV studies used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-CoV-2 used an ACE2 reception to enter the human cell.
There are three vaccines that are being examined.
First of all, researchers are aiming to make a whole virus vaccine.
The virus’s use, either inactive or dead virus, is designed to quickly trigger human immune reactions to new COVID infection.
Second strategy, subunit vaccine, aim for creating vaccines that make sensitive systems to certain subunit on the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on S-sike protein that helped the virus to infiltrate the ACE's Pym reception.
The third strategy is acid acidic acid vaccine (cactin DNA or RNA, new techniques to make vaccines).
In March 16, 2020, a vaccine has to begin with four volunteers at Seattle.
Vaksin contains a genetic code that is copied from the virus that causes disease. The impact was recommended as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There's more than 300 active linis tests going on April 20,20.
Seven trials are trying to evaluate the treatment that has been approved for malaria, including four studies of hydroxocin or chloculin.
The drug that has been given a new purpose forms most of Chinese research, with nine test tests tested Fase III on the brakesivir in some countries with export time at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of vaccin development for vaccines and COVID drugs is already present. Some of the specialized drugs that are currently being assessed for COVID-19 medical treatment, which include chloccin, chromocroccin, lolocer/navar, and lovorvir/biriririririririririririritom.
In March 20, 2020, there was a temporary evidence for the balance of the brakes.
The growth of linis is observed on patients who are treated with brakesivir in emergency treatment.
Test clinis Fase III is being done in the U.S. Chinese, Chinese, and Italy.
However, there is a call to research on the research project.
Korean Health Authority and Chinese Chinese recommended cloculin use.
However, the Virology Institute of Ocean, though recommended a single gram - day dose, records that doses are twice as dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 20, 2020, the FDA released emergency authorization for hydroxicculin and chlorine policy for a doctor who takes care of COVIDian's ill-disputer edition, as well as interferon, aboverin, or umifenovor to be used against COVID.
Early data shows that high doses abovevirin are required to hinder SARS-CoV-2 in vice.
Nitzoksanide has been provided for further study in vivo after showing SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration. Preditions show that the initial strain on protein to tonsjolan by a non-crespectation rate of transmestage 2 (TMPS2) is vital to get into SAR-CCCVVV2 with the anti-explCCCCCUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCUTAN
Sttudi about chlocuin and hydroxocin with or without azitromyins has a major limitations that have prevented medical communities from using this therapy without further research.
Stokin storm complications can happen to COVID, which is heavy.
There's evidence that hydroicocrokuin may have an antisitokin properties, and Tocilizumab has been included in medical guidance by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small research is completed.
This drug is undergoing a 2 - story stage test at the national level of Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a test of critin's blood to identify the katokin storm, this drug was meant to fight a stokin storm, which is thought to be the cause of death on some people who are at peace.
In 2017, the interlekin-6 subagotor was approved by FDA based on a review of Rictipal cases for medical treatment of stokin’s steroid syndrome produced by a different cause, which is CAR T cell therapy.
Until now, there's not any random and controlled evidence to show that the cycilizab is a correct treatment for CRS.
Employing refined antibodis and blessed by a person’s recovering system from the COVIDian system to those who need it are being examined as a nonvak passive method.
This strategy is tried for SARS with unconsistive results.
Netalization virus is a work mechanism expected for passive antibodi therapy can improve defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, another mechanism, like a mobile cyclone that depends on antibodi and/or phagotosiosis, too.
Another passive antiboodi therapy, for example, uses the ictoal antibodi anticronalally produced, is in development.
The level of convalesen called the fluid part of the patient’s healing blood and contains specific antibodi against this virus, can be improved for faster use.
Megravius disease, a group of closely associated syndromes
Li Wengan, a doctor at the House of Ocean, who was infected and then infected and died because COVID19 after seeing the consciousness of the virus being preached.
