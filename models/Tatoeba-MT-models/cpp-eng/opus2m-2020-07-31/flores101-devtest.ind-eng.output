His original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptability as before.
Over time, when new populations are beginning to adapt to their new surroundings, they seem to have become more like other populations.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will seem so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call it the process of speculation, which means the formation of new species.

For example, someone can say that cars should lead to the development of the highway.
Even so, national highway networks are not economically qualified for a few cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce car ownership costs.

Wild children may have had severe harassment or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are thought to be raised by animals; some say they have lived in the wild.
When animals are brought up completely by nonhumans, wild children show behavior (in physical boundaries) almost completely like certain animals who take care of them, such as fear or disobedience to man.

The user's video recording leads to an important discovery of micro-distinct expression, facial movement, which occurs in milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that we can detect whether someone lies by observing his micro expression properly.
In that case called The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks shows how someone who doesn't understand the speech of brain damage is still capable of accurately judging others.
He even proposed that the ability to interpret such human behavior might have been owned by animals like a pet.
The 20th century study shows that there are two genetic variations: hidden and exposed.
The feature adds a new genetic variation, while the selection removes it from the range of expressions.
Segregate and recombination often mixing through two pools with each generation.
In the desert, it is difficult for primates with human digestive systems to meet the needs of amino acids from the available source of the horn.
In addition, failure to do so has a serious effect — a growth depression, a lack of nutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily acquired source of horn is a protein that is in the leaves and nuts, but it's hard to digest for primates like us, unless it's cooked.
Instead, animal foods are not only easy to digest, but they also provide the amount of high protein that contains all the important amino acids.
"By considering all things, we should not be surprised when our ancestors deal with "a protein problem" in an almost similar way to those who save us in the countryside right now."
Sleep disorder is the process you wake up deliberately during normal sleep period, then fall asleep a few moments later ♫60 minutes).

Even though train tracks are only paralleled woodboards, with this route they can pull cars so that they can pull more heavy loads than the road that is a little rough at the same time.
The tracks were introduced from the start to hold track in place, but gradually it was realized that the track would be more efficient if it had a layer of iron on the top.
It's a common practice, but iron causes wooden wheels on the train more quickly broken.
In the end, the wooden wheel was replaced by an iron wheel.
The first known transmission was to walk, with Homo Erectus' appearance (which means humans standing) two million years ago, man started walking upright.
