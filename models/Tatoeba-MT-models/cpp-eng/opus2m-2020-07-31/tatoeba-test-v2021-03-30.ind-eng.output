I was sleeping when Markus came.
I can't reach my right hand.
I'm hungry.
Yoko refused to answer my question.

Like a father, like a child.
Some of my friends speak English very well.
Tom's pointing the floor.
He's been a very good man lately.
He's from France.
Tom knows he heard something.
The health is more valuable than gold.
I am happy to help her.
Learning about foreign culture is fun.
When did you start wearing a lens?
Tom wouldn't like that answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to contact us earlier.
Without fear, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnic and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too blunt until it can't be used to cut flesh, eventually I'm using my pocket knife.
Over his eyes blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's a forgetr.
Where have you been?
The lights were used to set traffic.
Don't let Tom see these photos.
This room got a little sunshine.
He's painting a picture.
I shouldn't have broken that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I'm used to not getting up.
It smells so bad.
Words are words.
There is no god but Allah, and he is a Messenger of Allah.
I found out yesterday.

Let's take the Intercity-Express train.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brother likes music.
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Wanna go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I think I can come by this afternoon.
"It's not worth waiting for two hours." "Yes, this signature I'll keep for the rest of my life."
Tom is one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I'm just telling Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ant.
You'll never be able to find a way home, through a narrow road.
Tom was really not home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
That guy's driving a car.
It's a birthday card that'll be here soon.
Please read it one more time.
How can you do that?
I'm just kidding.
Tom's almost hit.
I'm going, too.
Love never is wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The fee has been including payment for professional services to finish the survey.
You don't really want to study logogram, do you?
Tom tried to persuade Mary to help her.
Two things are not related.
How could I not realize this?
What's this called?
I'm still at home because the rain is coming down.
That's the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
For me, there is no fundamental difference between the culture of both countries.
He's having an affair.
Wake me up at eight right.
Tell me why he's not present.
That might affect their decision.
It's been raining for a whole night.
Tom's getting jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy you this bag.
It's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Have you ever been to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready.
Mary refused an invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
He's sitting around his grandchildren.
The boy's been sleeping in his bed for a while.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left street.
He's focused on the riddle.

Want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We know that front door is locked.
Can I talk to Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is his acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying on a plane.
I've suspected that he's lying, but that doesn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I can't finish reading this thick book within a week.
The choice of time was very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other choice.
I'm not sure what else I have to do.
We've done what we can.
Any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
In front of the law we're all around, but the rich sometimes have more advantage.
He's gonna make it.
I like cats.
It's over at nine o'clock.
Tom was mentally disturbed.
Could I be crazy?
We're faced with a very difficult winter.
I have to ask you a question, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone deserves.
Everyone's done something wrong.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mom's been gone for ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, just you can't drive.
May I see your coupon?
He looks serious reading.
Tom married a woman that's easier than him.
He's a copy of his father.
He has a good word to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.

They suggest that he go alone.
Tom was a good man.
I'll call back in 20 minutes.
They swim.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom lied to Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of the students went to college.
Tom put the pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom's letting down his voice so no one can hear it.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he long hair?
She greets him every morning, when she enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very steep, it's better to go to the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
Her mother was worried about her son.
What Opera is being shown at Lincoln Center right now?
I feel tired.
Tom killed Mary.
The data is often inaccurate.
Get up!
We've ordered that's six o'clock.
We named that dog Tim.
He opened the letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom signaled Mary to follow her.
It's been 11 o'clock.
I'm smarter than them.
It's getting dark.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows him admires him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those guys are crazy!
