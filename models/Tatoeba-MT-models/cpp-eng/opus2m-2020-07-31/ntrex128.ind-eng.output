Members of the Assembly (AM) Welsh's worried that they're looking like doll mappets'.
There's a worry between some AMs against a substation that they're supposed to be transformed into MWPs (Man of Welsh Parliament/ Members of the Parlemen Welsh).
This is due to a plan to change the name of the House into the Parliament of Welsh.
The AMs around the entire political spectrum are worried that it could invite the romance.
A single labor party said that his group was concerned, "It's as small as Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the assembly says that his group is one unit, feeling "unhappy" and has proposed some alternative.
A Conservative Welsh said that his group was "inconsistent" with the change of names, but judging that this is a supposition of MWP's briefing into Muppet.
In this context the word w in Issh is spoken like an u in English Yorkshire.
The Commission on the current committee set up laws to introduce the change of the name, saying: "The final conclusion of any explanation of the MAMs is certainly a problem for those members."
The government's decision of Wales 2017 gives power to the Wales Council to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on a proposal known to receive extensive support to refer to me as the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the problem of the AM calls, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Mebers/ Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option gets the most support on public consultation.
The AMs seem to file an alternative option, but the struggle to reach the chief can be clearing the chairman, Ellin Jones, who is expected to submit the change plans in a couple of weeks.
These reformal laws will include changes -- other changes about how the office works, including the rules qualified for the AMs and the committee system plans.
The AMs will get the final sound of the question about how they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
The People of Macedonia went to give a voice to the pleberendum about the change in state's name
The sound owners will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "The Book of Northern Macedonia."
It was held in an effort to settle disputes for a decade with a Greek neighboring country, which also had a province named Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor's neighboring country shows a recognition of his area and has repeatedly rejected European and NO.
The president of Macedonia Gjorge Ibov, a voter for a name change, has said that he's going to ignore the vote.
However, supporterendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the change of name was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATa.
Lonceng-lonceng St.Martin was un-titled when the churches in Harlem were having a hard time
"The historical way, the parents I'm talking to say there's a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, there's no one."
He said that missing all the bar could be understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways" right now, he says.
"Bar is no longer a public guest room around where people visit him regularly."
So does the church, she's worried that sales money won't last long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they'll come back from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by an apartment building with condoms full of people who would not help to keep the holy places around them.
"The person who would buy condoms in these buildings is white,," he said, "and that will speed up the day where these churches are closed together at the same time because there's no way that people who move into these condoms will be members of these churches."
The two churches were built by the white church before Harlem became the black - covered metropolis in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Metocdic Jemaat moved in the 1930s.
The black row that had been worshipped in the surrounding regions has taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black church under the head of Reverend John Howard, who led a high - tech bottle merchant on the road 125th, the main way of shopping in Harlem, who refused to work or promote black people.
Fire in 1939 caused the building to be severely damaged, but when President Johnson’s parishers planned to rebuild, they built a tower bell.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at St. Martin proudly calls the tower bell of the poor
An expert who rang the tower bell in July gave him another name: "A culture treasure" and a "a sustainable history instrument."
A scholar named Tiffany Ng of Michigan University also noted that this is the first tower bell in the world that was played by black musicians A. Lind who had turned on a bigger tower bell in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in Santo Martin the last few months was a complicated architectural and contractor account, some brought by the leaders of the public church, and the others were brought by Epikopal's shirt.
The vestrys - the body of managers, made up of civil leaders - wrote letters to torture in July with concerns that "will try to charge" on vestry, even though vestry wasn't involved in the recruits and contractors sent by the need.
Some parokis complain about the lack of flexibility on the side.
Hiu injured a 13-year-old teen in a lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobster in California in the opening session of lobster season, he said an officer.
The attack occurred before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinity.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then rowed in groups to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a relief of excitement after he caught the lobster, but then he was "from" that the boy shouted, ‘ I got bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His whole cell bones were torn apart, " Hammel said that he realized when he was getting to the child.
"I cried out to everyone to go out of the water: ‘ There is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was dropped to Rady's Child Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The species of sharks in charge of the assault is unknown.
The Captain of Larry Giles Beach said in the media conference that a shark had been seen in that area a week earlier, but it was highly classified as a species of harmless shark.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries on the top of her body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Encinity for 48 hours for investigation and security interests.
Giles realized that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this region, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sciencebury's plan broke the British beauty market
Sciencebury took over Boots, Superdgugs and Debenhams with the dressy-played dressers administered by specialist-consistent assistants.
As part of a substanceal boostment towards the British beauty market of between pounds.8 billion, which continues to grow while the sale of fashion products and household equipment is down, the larger beauty-kios will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if it is proved successful.
Investation in beauty is a hunting for the supermarkets to use the rockets used as a TV display, microwave, and household equipment.
Sciencebury said that it would double the size of beauty offers to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The combination of brands that exist at this time begins from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with a different area like those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also launched back a series of spots so that most of its products would be friendly for havinggan - something more preferred by young staffs.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfumer will test concesssion in two science stores, the first one opened in Croydon. London south last week, while the second will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, last year.
The online board and switching the purchase of daily food in small amounts in local power stores means that the supermarket has to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, head of Sciencebury executive, has said that the geo-gerai will become more like Mall when the supermarket chain is trying to fight behind the pens like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and unpreserving service.
Sciencebury has placed the Argos geies on hundreds of shops and has also introduced some of the noises since they bought those two giants two years ago, which he said has supported the sale of daily food and made me feel more beneficial.
The previous supermarket attempt to renovate the beauty department and Pharmation ended with failure.
Science tests the attempt of sculptures with Boots in the early 2000, but the same work ended after the conflict on how to divide the profits from the chemical store in the supermarket.
A new strategy came up after Sciencebury sold 281 fashion stores into Ceresio, the owner of Farmasaki Lloyds, a rate worth $125 million, three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding various fancy leather treatments including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the sciencesbury, said: "We've changed the display and nuance on beauty-kios to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand sequence was designed so that according to all the needs, the appealing environment, and the comfort of the location that we are now in the most challenging pursuit of shopping."
Peter Jones ‘geram' after Holly Willoughby pulls himself off the deal worth of pounds 1111juta
Dragons Den star, Peter Jones went ‘ muffled' after the bearer of Holly Willoughby's TV show pulled off from a life-style deal worth of pounds111juta to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage the trademark of household equipment and their accessories, Truly.
This couple business is compared to a Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
This Morning, aged 37, uses his Instagram account to announce that he's out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons Star Den, Petes Jones angry with an appeal at the last moments of their lucrative lifestyle business -- to focus on his bigger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source stated that Jones was so "Geram" when the gold girl admitted during the meeting of her business headquarters on Marlow, Bockingshire, that the new deal was worth it to pounds 1.5 million - means she no longer had enough time to spend on their household equipment brands and access to their home equipment, Truly.
Their business has been compared to a Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and is estimated to double Willoughby's wealth for $11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Brinia to one of his vacation homes,
A source says: "Truly so far is his most important priority.
It was going to be a long-term future, which would make it endure for the next few decades.
His decision to back off is to turn everyone into a real shock.
No one can trust what happened on that Tuesday, really near the time of launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready to sell"
Experts believe that leaving the bearer of This Morning, which is one of the most expensive English stars, could cost the company up to millions of dollars because of a large investment in product form, from pillows and candles to household equipment, as well as the potential for further launch delays.
And this could mean the end of long - standing relationships.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin are very close to Jones and Tara Capp's wife for 10 years.
Willoughby established Truly together with Capp in 2016, and 52 - year - old Jones joined the head in March.
This couple were on vacation together and Jones had 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand-signer for M neighboringS and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV show host called I'm A Brainy.
A source near Jones said last night "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speak seriously ‘and then we fall in love'
He's joking about the criticism he's gonna get from the news media because of making comments some people view as "uncompression" and has been very positive to the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
The truck said with the noise of his message kicker.
"I don't give up anything."
He found out that Kim was interested in meeting her second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, praised by Trump as a step forward to North Korea’s denucirization.
But the deuklitrization negotiation has been stopped.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore, North Korea's senior diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders on Saturday that North Korea doesn't see any appropriate "reconspons" from the United States about the initial movement of North Korean weapons.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to continue the policy of maintaining pressure.
The truck was more optimistic in his speech series.
"We did our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this incredible relationship,"
He said that his success in repairing Kim had brought on positive results-- to stop rocket experiments, to free hostages and return the rest of the American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to be president, but rather than having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to the right direction of the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia and the earthquake shattered an island, killing hundreds of people
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non - governmental organization was told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok population lost their homes, there is no national disaster claim, as a disguise to bring international help.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've made it clear that they don't ask for international help, so this is a bit challenging," said Mrs. Sumbin.
While Save The Children is setting up a team to go to the hammer, there is no doubt that foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the office of national disaster repeated, said that Indonesia's office is reviewing the situation at the tree to see if foreign institutions are allowed to contribute to help.
In view of the ongoing earth’s shock of Indonesia, this country is still very unprepared to face natural anger.
While tsunami protections have been built on the scene, it is not a common view on the other beach.
There is no tsunami alert on the tree, even though danger warnings have been announced, most likely have contributed to life’s victims.
At the best times, the trip between many islands of Indonesia is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The town hospital that had been placed in Lombok to care for earthquakes on the way to the trees, but it would take at least three days to reach a new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made a broken Indonesian infrastructure repair as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of the highway and the rails.
But the lack of funds has interrupted Father Joko's government while he's faced the election back next year.
Joko's father also faced the pressure of the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have embraced more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people fled their homes when Muslims and Christians fought in the street, using wars, bows, and arrows, and other sharp weapons.

The Parlement Cromwell statue became the last memory affected by the history of it
The birth will be a poetic justice for the destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts performed by fanatic followers.
But Cromwell's people describe Mr. Crick's advice as "senseless" and "retry to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, leader of the Cromwell community, said: "This can't be avoided in debate at this moment about the destruction of images, that figure Oliver Cromwell outside of Westminster's palace will be targeted.
The British civil war is not ordered or done by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong descendants of Cromwell would have been sacrificed for Thomas's ancestors' actions in the past century.
An amazing revision of Cromwell from Sir William Hamo Thornyroft is a 19th-century opinion and part of the hitorography a figr that is still believed that many people still deserve to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmitth said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many people, probably in the end of the 19th century than today, as a defense against outside pressure, in case of course the kingdom.
Is that fully accurate representation, still subject to the ongoing debate of history.
Which is for sure that conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the next nation, and Cromwell is a figure that can be known as individuals who represent one side of the difference.
He is the Lord of all the worlds."
The Killer pig Treats Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to a local media report.
Men, identified only with his bitter name "Son", were found dead with arteries cut off, blood covered near a pig cage in the city of Liupanstru province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reporting on Sunday.
A pig rancher prepared to inject vaccines to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005, the Xinning province of Duphai, China.
He reportedly went out with his cousin from the province of Yunnan on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw a pig's gate near him was open.
He said that in a pig cage there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
Scientific studies confirm that male pigs weighing 550 pounds have persecuted the farmman to the death, according to reports.
"My cousin was bleeding and destroyed," said the cousin who was known for "Wu", as Guianging News quoted.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entered the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or to his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent attacking others, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuans and market authorities reportedly negotiated compensation for death.
Although rare, pig attacks against humans have also occurred before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachossett caused the man to be seriously injured.
10 years earlier, a pig with a heavy 550 pounds of a farmer named Welsh to his tractor until the wife scares out the beast.
After a zoo farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but blood scents can act as "shot".
"They're just messing around.
They're bits, really curious... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give her enough respect," she said.
The remains of Rosa's storm brought rain to the north of the United States.
As expected, the storm Rosa weakens when moving above the cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
After all, Rosa will cause a flood in the entire northern part of Mexico and western United States a few days.
Rosa has a wind at 85th, storm Kategori 1, starting at 5 a.m. on Sunday at the time of the East province, and is 35 miles southwest of PuntaEgenia, Mexico.
Rosa probably moved north on Sunday.
In the meantime, Palung began to form above the Pacific Ocean and moved east toward the West Coast of the United States, when Rosa approached the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began pushing tropical moisture north to the west of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture associated with an approaching necklace will create widespread torrential rains in the West for several days to come.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debrising flow and possible long - standing soil in the desert.
The low tropical heat will cause rain levels to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some point, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain is estimated to fall in some West Power, especially in most Arizona.
The flood is likely to happen at a rapid rate because of the spread of tropical rain.
It's not recommended that we explore deserts by walking on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause the abyss to turn into a violent river, and a storm will carry a violent, local wind.
The approaching necklace will cause local rains to reach parts of South California’s coast.
The total rainfall that exceeds half an inch is enough, which can cause small debris to flow and highways to be slippery.
It's gonna be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some widespread tropical rain will start near Arizona last Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains become larger on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain would reach four corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
In October there will be some great change in temperatures throughout the United States when the Arctic became colder, but the tropical area remains quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic change in the short range.
There's a right example of the dramatic difference in temperatures along the middle U.S. section of the Sunday.
There's a difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Ohmaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the warmth of the remaining summer will form and return to spread.
Most U.S. and eastern regions are expected to start warm starting in October at the speed of spreading 80s from the South Plain to parts of the North Sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast showed a high chance for temperatures above average for the eastern United States to midway October.
Over 20 million people have witnessed the Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanough and the woman who accused her of committing sexual violence that happened in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political gardens continue, with publishers who interrupt regular events to preach unexpected events last minute on Friday: A deal designed by Senator Carter Jeff Flake for the FBI to do an investigation for one week on the charge.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was getting drunk and trying to take her clothes off at the High School's High School party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
There is probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, have seen it.
The company counts the average audience at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Calculation for another network that broadcasts this is not available quickly, including PSS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen used to be having trouble in counting the number of people watching him in the office.
To put this thing in perspective, it's the number of viewers that are almost the same as playoff football or Academy Family.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion supports the Kavanaugh pointer, superior from all networks with an average of 5,69 million retailers throughout the congregation all day, says Nielsen.
ABC occupy a second position with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.5 million, said Nielsen.
The printer stays high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in that Friday drama.
After the government office of the Republic makes a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he caught the camera CNN and CBS on Friday morning being yelled at by the feeling when he was trying to ride an elevator to the Ministry of Justice.
He's standing down a few minutes when he's washed a maki, broadcast directly at CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have the power when there are many helpless women.''
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee congregation.
The TV wire and broadcast network all ran directly a few hours later, when the Ministry of Justice will choose to advance Kavanughs to all of the Senate for vote.
But Flake says he's only gonna do that with understanding that the FBI will check charges against the candidate for a week, as the Democrats have been asked.
Flake has been assured of some of the conversation with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
The post of conversation with Coons and some senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's obvious that the Republican party will have no voice to approve Kavanugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened the FBI investigation for charges against Kavanaugh.
The prime minister of England accuses the critics of ‘ playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May is accusing the critics of "stacking" with the future of Brinia and ruining national interests, on his plan to get out of the European Union, in an interview with Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that appeared on the front page of the newspaper, former minister Boris Johnson highlighted the attack on what he called Chequers' plan for Brexit, saying that proposals about England and the EU that have to gather each other is "indispective."
The police caught Dyteon Simson's suspect in the death of an LSU player.
The police have caught a suspect on a fatal shooting that resulted in Wayde Sims' death, a 20 - year - old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simson, 20 years old, has been arrested and imprisoned with a murder charge of two-level murder, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The office released a video confrontation between Sims and Simson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during a fight.
The police found those glasses at the scene and said that they found Simson's DNA on the stuff, the WAFB CBS's client reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he'd been doing a fatal shooting on Wayde.
The contract has been set up a $350,000, the Advokat reported.
Coroner Paroki Baton Rouge's office released an early report on Friday, saying that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head to the neck.
The department is grateful to the state State Police investigation, the state police lab, the Southern University police and the people around in assisting an investigation that leads to arrest.
The LSU Olympic director Joe Alleva says thank you for law enforcement over "crowdings and a search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
At the height of 6,6 feet live in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The average point of him is 5.6 and shows up to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "scraped" and "tricked" with Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," said Wade.
The volcano bursts the ashes of Mexico City
The Abu that came out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the south area around the capital of Mexico.
National Disaster Center warns Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in the air and registered there are 183 gas emissions and ashes in more than 24 hours.
The center was monitored several times with shocks and shocks.
The images in the media show a thin layer of ashes attached to the front glass car in the neighborhood of Mexico City.
Physicists have noted the rise of activity in the volcano located 45 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital of the city since the 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
This volcano is known as "Don Goyo" that has been active since 1994.
Cops are mixed with a compound of Catalan on the course of independence election.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a pro-conservational demonstration with anti-serving police, and when thousands of people joined a rival demonstration to mark the first celebration of Catalonic correnization of self-disputation.
A group of prosex masks held by the anti-gained police threw them with eggs and threw powder paint, thus creating dark clouds of dust on streets where tourists would normally be filled.
A crime also occurred after that day with a cop who used their stick to control the dispute.
For a few hours, the group of pro-free groups screaming "No forgetting, no forgiveness" faced with the labor force that shouted, "Land Spanish Life."
Forty people received treatment for light injuries found in the protest, the local press reported.
The tension remained high in this free - minded area, a year after the October 1st reef, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by a sophomore.
The voters prefer to be free, though the number of low votes with those who oppose self-disputing and most of the votes.
According to Catalan's authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the votes in the TPS throughout the region in a fierce clash.
Pro-free groups have been camping all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support national police.
Demonstration continues but was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrical worker who attended protests with his wife said he no longer expected Catalonia's prospects to gain freedom.
"In the past we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for choosing, but now we're stuck," he said.
Even though it was successful to achieve a vital victory even though a little in the regional election last December, the pro-free parties have fought to maintain this year despite many of their well - known leaders, who are in exile or in custody waiting for the trial, on their role in organizing the pleendum and in the declaration of freedom.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded protests with her cell phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting a lot easier," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine sub-servorial leaders who spent the last year in pre-servation, announced that he was going to launch himself in the European Parliament election next year.
"Course as a candidate for the European election is the best way to counteract the decline in democracy and oppression we've seen from the Spanish government," he said.

The Got printed by Sera has won Livingston over Rangers by score 1-0
The first Dolly's fellowing for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston's victory led to the Rangers firing Steven Gerrard of his office as the manager of the Hesex club, for the defeat of both of them in 18 games.
Dolly's attack has become evidence of the difference when Gary Hold's side movement is equal to Himbernian in the second order.
The Gerrard side remained unstained in Premiership of this season and facing the leader of Hearts who is eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers brought you Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe, on Thursday.
Livingston, in the meantime, extending their invincible records in division into six games, while coach Hold still beats since Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost the chance to fight the reckless guest team
The Hold team should have gone far before they scored their goal, with their precision that gave Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his work missed the goal face, and then Alan Lithgow could only expand his work after sliding in and facing with Craig Hallket from the other side of the goal.
The host was content to let Rangers play superior at the beginning, knowing that they could make it difficult for the host team to die.
And that's how to achieve a very important goal.
The Rangers to break free kicks and Liveston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Sera, who got their turn and scored from the middle of the field.
At that stage the Rangers had dominated the authorities but realized that the defense of the host could not be detected and the Liam Kelly fan was completely uninvolved,
That pattern went on to second round, even though Alfredo Morelos managed to lure out of Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was abandoned by the foot of the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow were parked far away from the tactics of the other Livingston game.
The attack continues to come to Lake Livingston and constantly be prevented, while two penalty claims -- after Halkett's challenge on Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for handball - denied.
‘Fenomenal' of Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Atlair Lamont, Tony Macarni Arena
Performa and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
For one man, they're incredible, continuing to exceed hope on this ever - going track.
The style of play and personnel they've almost changed since they got back to the top board, but the big credit has to be given to Hold over how he's been strengthening the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Hallett is very large, leading organized defense, while accusing Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to keep alert during the game.
Nevertheless, Rangers lack inspiration.
As good as they're at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball wasn't good-- only once they could split the host's side-and it was a warning to Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
There's a variety of welcomes in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit to Germany-- which is intended to improve the relationship between NO’S allies.
They're arguing about problems, including human rights, press freedom and access to Turkey to the EU.
The next time you get to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
This town is home to the largest population of Turkey outside Turkey.
The police mentioned security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan pros-- a lot of them were Kurdi -- also vocally, deaning both, 186th and German government policy to welcome it in the country.
Protests of resistance are a contradiction to the existence of a commoncomer who was welcomed as a hero by some of the German Turks and was added to a dictator by another citizen.

Storm Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, with the Flood of The Drysing (Plasssion may be won)
The tropical depreciation that struck Arizona rarely occurred, but that is likely to happen in the early next week because of the trail of the storm Rosa's power left across the western desert, causing a risk of flooding by side.
National Weather Service has issued a warning of flooding on Mondays and Tuesdays for Western Arizona to South Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix cities, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is thought to be moving directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, going to hit on Monday night with the rain.
National weather services in Phoenix mentioned in twitter that there are only "ten tropical hurricanes capable of causing tropical storms or depression status in 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967 is a storm in 40 miles of AZ border area."
The latest storm Center's focused device is able to predict 2 to 4 inches [to 4 inches] of rain with a single total of six inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other western desert includes central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with the possibility of isolation within four inches.
For those in the free region of flood free, Rosa may have been a blessing because of the drought.
Although the flood is a serious problem, some of the rains are likely to be beneficial because the western region is currently being destroyed by drought.
According to the U.S. U.S. drought watcher, only about 40 percent of the region's having extreme droughts, second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the storm path Rosa led to the mainland across California’s Baja Peninsula
Rosa, still at the power of the storm on Sunday morning at 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moved north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm met with a cooler water area in the Pacific and was therefore weakened by its power.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with the power of the tropical storm in Monday afternoon or night.
The rain supply may be high in parts of Mexico, leading to the high risk of a flood
"Toltal molten rain three to 6 inches is estimated to cross the California Baja region to the western region of Sonora, probably rose to 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border on Tuesday of the day as a tropical depression, which will cross through Arizona and south Utah on Tuesday midnight.
"The main religion that might be hit by Rosa's storm or its remains is a very high rain shower in Baja California, the northwest region of the Sonora, and the U.S. region of the A.S.." The National Storm Center (NHC) states.
The rain is thought to be a threat to floods and debris of buildings that flow into the desert, and the land of the mountains.

Trump says that Kavanaugh is “perved with hate and anger" from the Democratic Party
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the cruel and embarrassing Democrat Party's plot," said Trump on a campaign in Wheeling, west Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh is "perved with hate and anger" from the Democrat Party during the process of pocalation
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, by having been forced and emotionally denied an accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that he committed sexual violence to him several decades ago when they were young.
Ford also testified to the trial of his statement.
The President said on Saturday that "the Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"One voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to stand up for someone who has the most perfect mind of the law in our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he told the crowd of West Virginia support.
The President is implicitally referring to Kavanaugh's users when discussing the importance of the Republic’s participation in the midelection.
"Lima weeks before one of our most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really struggling," he said.
"That's why I went there, fought for a great candidate.
The truck argues that Democrat is on the mission to fight and block.
The first radio proposal on the Senate level in Kavanaugh's construction expected to be performed later on Friday, an executive of senior GOP said to CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by an Indonesian earthquake, the tsunami, with the increased number of victims.
At least 384 people were killed, so many were running when a giant wave hit the coast, when an earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, said authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the town of the hammer on Friday when the waves were six feet [18 m] high (18 m) to crush the beach at dusk, causing many deaths and destroy everything that was passed through.
An earthquake followed by 7.5 power.
"When the tsunami threats increased yesterday, people still did their work on the beach and didn't run so soon that they were victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Office of Disaster (BNPB) said at no time in Jakarta.
"The Trenami didn't come alone, she dragged cars, wood, houses, followed all that was on the mainland," said Nugroho, adding that tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 kph speed (497/ph) before holding the beach line.
Some people climb trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of service at the hammer.
The air photo issued by the BNPB shows lots of destroyed buildings and shops, crooked bridges and a clearing and a mosque surrounded by water.
A round-stack earthquake shook the city along the coast on Saturday.
The impact of the earthquake is felt in an area of 2.4 million lives.
The Organization of Research and Technology Control (BPPPPPT) said in a statement that the energy released on that Friday earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the power of atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long bay, can increase the size of the tsunami, can say so.
Nugroho describes the damage that happens as "stensive" and states that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
Some of the victims were found trapped under the ruined ruins of buildings, he said, adding that there were 540 victims injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho says that the victims and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (90 miles) north of the tree, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake center.
Communication "is completely paralyzed with the lack of information from Donggala, says Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people who live there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading for the affected region.
"It's a tragedy, but it could be worse," he said.
Instants related on Saturday received a lot of criticism because they didn't inform us that there was a tsunami with a hammering, even though the authorities said that the waves had been on hand at warning.
An amateur recording shared in social media shows a man on the top of a building sounds like shouting a warning with panic of an approaching tsunami to the people who were on the street below.
Within minutes the water came to the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters can't soon prove that the recording's absolution.
Earthquakes and tsunamis are the biggest cause of power extinguishing communication around the tree so that the authorities make it harder to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has already begun sending cargo planes containing help from Jakarta and other cities, says authorities, but refugees are still in great need of food and other essentials.
The airport has been returned just to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation center on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami victims are growing above 800.
That's terrible.
When officials of the World Vision of Donggala managed to make it safe in the city of the Wood, where the officials took refuge in the tent of cloth that was built in their office, on their way through the widest regions, said Father Dobia.
"They told me they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's terrible.
Even when the aid group began moving slowly to start disaster - repeating activities, some of those groups complain about foreign volunteers who had skills, who were about to leave for the tree.
According to Indonesia's rules, funding, aid and energy from overseas can only begin to be cleared if the affected areas have been officially declared as a national disaster region.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a national disaster, "Aulia Arriani's word, the spokesman for the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the government says, OKE, this is a national disaster, we can receive international help, but there is no such status."
On the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in the wood, friends and family of the lost victims still hope that the people they love will be part of the wonders that will fix the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was kicked out of a got.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the debris for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subdono, coach of the Indonesian national paralatons, has become a trainer for two missing paralalams, who were able to follow Asian Games that ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Mr. Sendi, are his students.
"As a senior in the field of paradise, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Gendon's father told me how after the news about the Roa-Roa Hotel that was destroyed around the parade community, he was desperate to send the WhatsApp message to the Wood Compers, who joined in the celebration of the beach.
Even so, all the messages, have only one sign of gray ends, not of two blue - colored ticks.
"I think it means the message is not sent," he said.

The Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West turned his name into Ye.
Noting the change in name by Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who used to be formally known as the Western Kanye."
West, 41 years old, has been calling Ye for some time and using that name as the eighth album title, released in June.
The change was made before its performance on the Night Liveday, when he expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to perform on the show, which was canceled because of "an emotional reason," said the show engineer.
As a brief for his current professional name, West once said that for him it had religious significance.
"I believe "ye" is a word commonly used in the Bible, and it means ‘ you," says West at the beginning of this year, discussing album titles with Radio Big Boy publishers.
"So I am you, I am us, that name is us.
The name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Ye-- as a mirror of our goodness, our misfortune, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of our true mirror."
He's one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs with various ways have been known as Puff Daddy, P.D.D. or Addy, but this year announces his preferences for Love and Brother Love.
The former West businessman, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of contact and big letters.
President Mexico, AMLO, swear not to use the military in dealing with civilians.
President Andrew Lopez Workador has sworn never used military force against civilian society in the 50th year of bloody recursing against students.
Lopez Workador promised Saturday on Tlatellolco Plaza for "will never use military power to pressure Mexicans."
The army launched fire at a peaceful demonstration activity in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when the movement of the left - winged students grew roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Workor has guaranteed support for young Mexicans by giving those who are in college and opening up more free university.
He said that unemployment and lack of education opportunities encourage young people to form criminal gangs.
A.S. was supposed to double A.I.'s funding.
Because China is more active in artificial intelligence, U.S., it should double the amount of funds that will be used for research in that field, says investor and possible A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who's been working for Google, or Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the U.S. government make an announcement about A.I., even when the A.S. is completely lacking an AI formal strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced his plan last year: The goal to be number 1 in AI's AI innovation in 2030.
"Ending AI's research fund is a good start, considering all other countries tend to stay away from the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in the field of AI," said Lee.
E.S. Lee told CNBC in an interview on this week.
Lea, the owner of the book "A SuperPoves: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mufflin Harcourt, CEO of the Ventures, who's already invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s in Carnegie Mellon University he designed the AI system that defeated the best American Othello player, and then he was adopted as an executive at the House of Research and the president of the Chinese branch.
Lee admits competition for U.S. government technology. was like a robotic challenge for Mut's Research Project and asked when the next activity will be done, to help identify the next visioner.
The shrink at the U.S. often has to work hard to win the prize from the government, says Lee.
"That's not the Chinese who took the head of the academy; it was the company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired characters from the university for the AI study in the past few years.
Lee says that an immigration policy changes can also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for the PhD title in AI's field," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued a plan of Next Generation Development in July 2017.
The Chinese Ilmu Foundation provides funds for people in academic institutions is the same as the nature of the Nature of Nature and other government organizations that share money to researchers of the U.S., but the quality of academic work is lower in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Building Center, which was designed to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Committee for Coservity.
And this month DARPA (Recent Defense Research) announces an investment of 2 billion Dolars in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, the DARPA recently invested more than 100 million dollars per year for AI research.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislation that asked to be established by the National Security Commission for Coscience doesn't see any further behaviors for months.
The people of Macedonia have taken a vote in order to change state names
The people of Macedonia made a vote on Sunday to decide the change of the country's name to be the "The Book of North Macedonia," an action that will settle the conflict for a decade with the Greek that has made their membership offer to become part of the European Union and NO.
Greek, which has the province of Macedonia, maintains the opinion that the northern neighboring country's name represents the recognition of its territory and has forbidden its joining the country with NO and the European Union.
The two authorities reached a deal in June based on the new name presented, but nationalistic opposition was in effect that changes would destroy the identity of most of the Mexican Slavian ethnic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't give his voice to the general selection and a bicot campaign has emphasized doubts that the selection results can reach up to 50 percent of the votes that are needed for the votes to be specified.
The question on the slightest sound reads: "Do you approve of the membership of the ATO and EU by accepting a deal with the Greek."
The expression of changeing names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price worth getting access to such bodies as the Union of Europe and NO for Macedonia, one of the countries born from the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so they could live free under the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgjevka, 79 years, in the Spupje.
Although many members of the parliament are not legally bound by law, they are sufficient to comply with the voice - making results of their decision - making work.
The change of names requires a vote of two to three in parliament.
State election commission says there's no violation report until 1 p.m.
However, it turns out that the votes were only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the final election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters gave their voice letters.
"I came to give my voice for my children's sake, where we were in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years, a voter at the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and his son got their voice for general election in Macedonia in order to set up a change in the country’s name in order to join the country’s NO and European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, has been preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of the tents that those who are about to smoke the votes.
"We agreed to join NOTO and the European Union, but we wanted to join in honor, not through the waitress door" said Kavadarkov.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NO's membership will bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has a level of unemployment over 20 percent.
"I believe most of the population would agree to it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NOTO," said Zaev after giving his voice letter.
He said the results of "yes" would be our future confirmation."
A statement published by the Council of Macedonia policy on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of votes will be part of the votes - less than the number required.
Another opinion, held by the Macedonia Telma TV station, found 57 percent of the response that was planned to join them on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said it would choose yes.
For the vote to be successful, it takes 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the vote will represent the initial rejection of pro-Barat government since taking over in May years ago.
Witness: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City explores the whole Brighton defense to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling are being called defense Brighton at Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Ethad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the victory look very easy on the score in the 65th minute.
Argentina's winner received an operand in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran among three Brighton defendrs, before his neck gets into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green-assed men.
He's turning past one defendr before running ahead of a few more guys at the edge of Brighton's goal.
Then he pulls to his left, to Sterling.
The British front ground used his first kick from the goal to pull the ball back to Aguero, which used his right leg to defeat the Brighton kinper, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero fought with some problems at his feet," said Pep Guandioola manager City to reporter.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Sure enough, the young Bethelites have befriended Jacob.
We had a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who made the first profit to Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
The house happened in the second minute.
Aguero received the ball, deep in the Brighton region on the game.
He's doing a ball with a distant kick that's stunning through the left wing to Leroy Sane.

Scherzer wants to complains of Rockies spoiler
With Nationals on the playoff game, there's no reason to force another game.
But Scherzer was too competitive to expect to be able to mount up with Colorado Rockies on a game on Sunday, but only if there's a playoff complications for Rockies, which is superior in one game on Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies had at least got a place after winning the wild-card fight against Nationals by score 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to achieve their first division degree.
"Even though we play without victory, at least we can know the atmosphere in this Denver with the crowd of the crowd and another team that will compete at the highest levels of any point I might face this year.
How can I not compete in a game like that?"
Nationals hasn't announced the opening game for Sunday, but it's reported that in such a situation, they'd rather let Scherzer join in.
Scherzer, who will start leaving for the 34 times, conducted practice sessions on Thursday and started a Sunday game that used to rest.
Washington's right-hand Pitcher is the score score of 18-7 with average run (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strikee-out in 220/3 inning this session.
The truck was filming in West Virginia.
The President was evidently referring to the situation of the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court, Fort Kavanough, when discussing the importance of the voice of the Republican community in the middle election.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before it's the most important election in our lives.
It's one of the great, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting all places for a great candidate," he said.
Trump goes on, you see a very radical Democrat group, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you saw the crime, their crime.
They don't care who they hurt.
Democrat, he said, is on a mission to "repose and block."
"And you saw it for the last four days," he said, "the Democrats and evil and vile and unbelievable."
He was referring to the Senate Dianne Feinstein, a welcomer in the Senate Court by mentioning his name, who was warmly welcomed by his listeners.
"Remember what's the answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for it-- it's a very bad body language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
Work Party is no longer a public service place.
Now it's inlerable to anyone who puts his mind on it.
When Mosingom activists at my local party gave a voice to remind me, it didn't surprise me.
After all, I was in the last order of Parliament, which was told that our presence was not expected because we expressed our opinion.
My contract was dismissed, Joan Ryan was treated similarly because he defended antisextism strictly.
In my case, the threat was critical of me for not having agreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of the responsible economic policy, in national security, in Europe, the issue is the same as that Jeremy Corbyn faced with the previous leader.
Notting for the meeting of the east Nottingham labor staff on Friday stated that "we want to meet to be incluctive and productive."
For nearly eight years I became a member of the local Parliament, a General Committee meeting on Friday night was exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the qualities of many meetings and promises about the "better, more friendly" than long forgotten, if it ever began.
The differences in the labor party are becoming clear that every opinion is judged by the authority of the party.
It began as soon as Jeremy was the leader, as a colleague I once thought would be able to share the same political view, starting to expect me to turn around and accept the position that I would never accept - both in national security and in the single European Union market.
Whenever I speak openly and no matter what I say - then it will be followed by the social association of the media that asks for a recursion, debasing the central politics, telling me I shouldn't be getting along with the Bust party.
And it's not just me.
Of course, I know that I'm better off than some of my colleagues because of the comments that are addressed to me are political ones.
I admire professionalism and the limitations of my colleagues who face sexual abuse or racism every day but never avoid.
One of the most disappointing aspects in today’s political era is how much abuse has been taken for granted.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the party was supposed to help develop the culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we're no longer in a larger church and with every "no confident" mode or changing the rules of the party to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that encouraged me to keep subjecting my head down, not talking too much, and then I would say "well."
But I didn't jump into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Bust 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by Thatcher's government description that led to my class of academic schools literally collapsed, I've been trying to serve better public services for those who need it very much as a local counselor and a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my political action, including the last election.
No one in the East Nottingham will question my policy position and things that I do not agree with in leadership right now.
For those who encourage the motion on Friday, what I can say is that when the country moves fast towards the sovereignty division, it would endanger our country's business and public service, I don't want to waste time and energy in faithfulness to the leader of the Bust party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Mondom, it's for my constituents, as a member of the Bustur or not. I'm proud to serve you and I promise that there's no threat of leadership or any political policy that would prevent me from doing what I believe is the best for you all.

Job 38 - 17 Melrose: Unable Jobr rises to the upper position
The last two experiments may have been a little of the finals, but no doubt Ayr is worthy to win the Tenent's Premiership game that is very entertaining today.
Now they're in a square order, the only unconquerable party of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and the ability to get the best chance, which makes the host team and coach Peter Murchie get the right to be happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still invincible, so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr's value, they're better off taking opportunities than we do."
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but the yellow card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, was given on the game by Warriors, giving Merose a chance to print numbers and Jason Baggot is sabotaged with an unagged experimented experiment.
Climo helps Jobr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of time, he scored the goal and then did a single experiment to make Jobr score 17-5 at rest.
But Melrose started in the second middle well and Patrick Anderson's experiments changed by Baggot, reduced the chance to five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruariad Knot was seriously injured, missed out, and since the beginning of the game, Ayr went faster than the experiment of Stafford McDowall, changed by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and again, Melrose made a reserve player pay with an ongoing Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of hard pressure.
The house has returned to play, but, when Struan Hutchinson gets a yellow card because it's without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind Ayr was wounded.
Climo was replaced, as it happened again, almost since the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe did the goal kicks and broke down the fifth attempt of Gregor Henry's reporter.
The Still Game star looks ready for his new career in the restaurant industry
The Still Game Kieran star looked ready to move course to the service industry after he had been introduced as a director of a released restaurant company.
And Jack Jarvis's 56-year-old actor at BBC popular show, who was monitored as well as in his star with his old comedian partner Greg Hephill.
The couple had announced that the ninth serial that was to come was the last episode, and apparently Kiers had planned to drive live broadcasts after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's the director of Adiftmortmorded.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun source source signaled that Kitan was trying to get involved in "a restaurant business developed in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land hopes that the court will return to the Pacific.
The tracker is on patrol at the large station of the forces that lies in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Navy base of Tratica to the Amazon is dipoles with a motto: "The sea is our rightful property.
To wake up is a duty."
Through Bolivia surrounded by land, memories of the defeat of a beach to Chile in a bloody 19th - century conflict still seem like a desire for one more time to cross the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its peak in a few decades, since Bolivia waited for a court decision on October 1 after an appeal for five years.
"Bolivia has a time, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope about the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat Bolivia.
Many Bolivia will watch the ICJ trial on the broad screen across the country, hoping that the court in Den Haag would support Bolivia's demands that-- after decades of the exciting appeal of the -Chire is obliged to negotiate Bolivia's sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivian primary president who's faced the controversial war for the next year's election -- also has a lot of support on Monday trial.
"We've been very close to the rescue of the Pacific Sea," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts are convinced that the court can't decide Bolivia's wishes-- and it's just a little change if it's possible.
The Dutch-deed United Nations's body has no power to hand over Chili's territory, and it has already determined that it will not decide the outcome of the odds.
That ICJ's decree comes only six months after the final argument, which indicates the case "no complex," said Paz Zárate, an international lawman Chili.
And still far from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years it may have been a downturn.
"The problem of access to the sea has been challenged by Bolivia's government now," said.
Morales' aggressive challenge has weakened the good incompetent of Chili's remaining people, he says.
Bolivia and Chili at a certain point are going to stick, but it's gonna be very hard to keep up with after this.
Both countries did not trade for one another from 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, director of Bolivia in De Haag refused the idea of making decisions quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open up an era of relationship with Chili and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual gain," she said.
Calzadila also denied that Morales- still one of the most famous Latin American presidents on issues of marijuana as a political support.
Bolivia would never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The invitation is an opportunity to see if we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons patrols won't happen unless they can trust the U.S.
The Minister of North Korea Ri Yong Ho says the first country will never have to disarm a nuclear weapon if Korea can't trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the time of the United Nations General Congregation.
He mentioned about the United States working on a deal that was made at a meeting in Singapore between a competitive leader.
His comment appeared when Secretary of State A.S. Mike Pompo was seen almost starting a nuclear diplomacy that had been dead for over three months after meeting with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's just a "real dream" that by continuing to deny the U.S. rejection of the declaration of the Korean War ruling will make North Korea surrender.
Washington's in case to agree with that declaration without a Pyong who made an effort to limit the armed forces first.
Both Kim and President U.S. Donald Trump wanted a second meeting.
But there's a doubt that Pyongang was really about the recognition of the armory of the country to be the only way to secure its security.
Pompo was planning to visit Pyongang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris mode show shows a lot of the latest collection of hoods to the main road near you
If you want to increase the collection of hats or really want to be protected from sunlight don't look for the others.
The Valentino designer and Thom Browne put out a series of large - size masks for their SS19 collection on their fashion display with a stunning style held in Paris Farshion Week.
The truly impractical hat has swept the Instagrams in this summer and these designers have played a dramatic creation on the screen.
The outstanding thing of Valentino is the cream hat on which it is decorated with the wide edge of the hair tub that covers the model's head.
The large - size accessiori includes a scaffold cell of diamonds, the hat of witches and even a butter, but it's not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a group of weird masks and just right up to Halloween.
Many of the various colors that his lips have been striped and similar to Hannibal Lecter than haute coulture.
A creation similar to that of a spructs equipped with snork and eye glass, while others look like ice cream that melts.
And if you keep track of the acbar mode collection-- then you're on your way.
Mode observers estimate that the large hat collection will be launched to the main path near you.
The big - size hat became an all-sized trend in the ‘La Bomba', straw hat with the width of two feet visible to the Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The worship of the label behind a highly impractical hat of social media makes a great creation in the beaches of the great straw almost the same as the bathing dress - used with a supple model.
The burning jammeria turalia bag, coming up with ravens on the edge of the edge with white handle rope, is the outstanding thing of the Jicquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
"I wish I saw a big hat and a beach bag arriving on the main road for the next summer-- 'cause designers have made a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for the big accessris'"
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens
Scotland's private school has kept a score of academic progress, and this was continued in 2018 with a tremendous test result, which is increasingly strengthened by every student and the collective success of sports, art, music, and earnest effort.
With over 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotland Foreign School (SCIS) School, are trying hard to give the best service for students and parents.
The school is designed to prepare its students for further education and higher education, their choice career, and their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement school curriculum as expected, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and desired lesson in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in the language he understands, you say you'll go into his head.
If you speak to him in his language, then your word will come into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can't only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test results of this year, we can see that language is the position of the league table with the highest graduation value in independent school.
Total 68 percent of foreign - language students get A Plus value.
The data, gathered from 74 SCIS school schools, showing that 72 percent of the students get A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish also get A.
This shows that the independent school in Scotland supports the foreign language as an important skill that should be needed by children and teenagers in the future.
Now languages, as a studyal option, are held in the same standard as STEM's class eye (sins, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Hard Work Service and the efficiency of the year 2014 found that from a few reasons why workers had to keep struggling to fill the room, 17 percent why it was a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their career in time.
With more and more opportunities for work that need language skills, this skill is important in the global world.
Whatever a person’s career choice, if they have learned the second language, in the future they will have real benefits because of having skills like this one.
Could communicate directly with foreign residents will automatically make a great multi-compresser in competition.
According to the opinion of YouGov in over 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them don't speak foreign enough well enough to do foreign talk and French became the only language spoken in two percentages, which is 15 percent.
This is why invest in language teaching for the children of today is important at this time.
Having a multivernal ability, especially the languages of developing economics, will provide children with a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the most important language in Britain for the next few years, that is 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected in a independent school, with the staff of teachers in this field.
Scotland's independent school is designed to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and supply them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
Could not be eliminated that right now, in global business environment, languages will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language must actually be considered "international communication skills."
The school will continue to offer the choices, diversity, and this uniqueness for Scotland’s teenagers.
Il fauta le faire.
John Edward is the director of the School School of Scotland
LeBron will take the dust to Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The appeal of fans to see LeBron James controls his dust to Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.

"At my current career stage, I don't have to do a pre-time game to prepare," he said.
General Trump schedule in West Virginia, Channel YouTube
President Donald Trump started the public meeting of the campaign tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first public meeting of five public gatherings scheduled for the next week, including a stop in some fun places covering Tennessee and Mississippi.
After being warned that the vote was delayed so that he could vote for the office of the Supreme Court, Trump meant to build his support for his future public election because the Republic was risky to lose the policy if the vote was taken in November.
What time is the general meeting of Trump in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Common Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia was scheduled at 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch a public meeting in West Virginia online by live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s trial for the future of the President Bret Kavanough Supreme Court, which is increasingly tense after the accusation of an improper sexual act and the claims of the Senate vote will be delayed for a week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main goal of this public meeting agency is to help the Republican party to get a few minutes in dealing with November's general election.
Therefore, in the campaign President Trump mentioned that five common gatherings in the next week are intended to “stirrify volunteers and supporters because of the Republic's party trying to protect and expand the majority they hold on the Senate and DPR," according to Reuters.
"Control congress is very important to its agenda so that the president will travel as many countries as we face a busy campaign season," the chairman of the Trump campaign, who refused to give his name to Reuters.
It was scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, a common meeting tonight expected to be able to provide support of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw lips from the media Pittsburgh," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be a second visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state that he won with over 40 percent of the time in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia Senate candidate of the Republican Party that left behind in opinion.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey so the president has to come as an effort to improve his gain in opinion," says Simon Haeder, political expert at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Capp 2018: The United States team is braved to maintain its hope in the face of a single Sunday match
After three sessions one-sided, Saturday afternoon four session is what may be needed in this Ryder Capp.
Champion swings are the concept of sports that is a fully trusted discovery by players, and no one exceeds the competition like this.
Where do they think they're going at this moment?
"Before, they were superior six points and now four, so I think we'd think of it as a bit of a kick," said Jordan Spieth while passing that day.
Europe, of course, has a advantage of four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, like Spiet said, felt they had a little momentum and they had a lot of things that could be the spirit, no exception to the form of Spiseth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each had a third of four points.
Spiseth has been playing lethally from the tee area to thegreen area and leading with the order.
Introductory that parau's celebration is getting harder when its turn comes, having a crucial following to make a series when he and Thomas lost two against two.
The beat of him who won them at 15 who were greeted by similar yelling, screaming that told you that he was sure America didn't lose.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own game," said Spie.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes that need to be marked.
The only player with the points more than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday was Francesco Molina and Tommy Fletwood, the story that didn't argue about Ryder Cop.
A unique but exciting couple from Europe are four to four and can do without a mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also got away from bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The Run, and how their energy seemed to flow either to or from this crowd that was sure they were to be defeated on Sunday, and there were no players more famous than Fletetwood or Molinary who would lock the potential potential of Europe at sunset over Le Golf National.
It's better at the same time that both of them are placed in different smell.
Still, it is too early to discuss Europe’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simson have a growing work, a football hero in the morning, when he was installed with Alex Norn.
One bogey and two doubles on front nine like digging a hole that could never be mastified by this Spanish golfer and Sweden.
Although, on Sunday nobody can help you out of smell.
Fourballs and poursomes are a fine show to look closer because of interaction between couples, what they suggest, advice they don't give and how strategy can change quickly.
So far, Europe plays better as a team and leads pretty far into the final day, but it also shows that the U.S. team has the guts to fight without doubt by some parties, especially in the United States.
Europe went down 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cop
Europe will take advantage of the final days of Ryder Capp after the rise of the fourball and poursome game Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
Two of these were inspired by Tommy Fletetwood and Francesco Molina to lead with two victories over Tiger Woods who had to fight their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to maintain a trofi that didn't get in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American team on the football morning, made this series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance to the poursome, won two games, but they can't reduce deficy.
Jim Furyk team needs eight points from 12 single games on Sunday to maintain trofi.
Fletetwood was the first European dust to win four points in a row, while he and Molina, who were called "Molliewood" after weekend, only to be a second pair of winning four points of their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cip.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs, they became very solid to beat Woods that beat Woods and the American bryson Dechambeau in a sharper 5174.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturdays, turns bright sometimes but he's lost 19 out of 29 games in football and poursome and a row.
Justin Rose, rest on the Fourball morning, then go back to pair with Henrik Stenson in the Fourome and lost 230,0001 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranks one and three worlds.
Europe didn't reach it itself even though the day was fun and winding up in the south of Paris.
The main winner of the three times Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas made a vote for America with two points on Saturday.
They got a 2-91 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in the football then back to beat Poulter and Rory McIroy 4373 in the poursome after losing two first smell.
Two times in Ryder Cop's history, a team came back from a four-point deficite to a single game, though as a champion of the Furyk team only needed a series point to maintain the trofi.
However, after being the second - day best for two days, Sunday's return attacks seem like they're going to go beyond them.
North Korea says 'unable' will disarm the weapon in the side without trust
On Saturday, North Korean ministers delivered to the United Nations about the constant threat of their disbelief to the United States and there was no way that the country was removing its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho delivered to the world's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "the significant steps that show good intentions" last year, like stopping nuclear testing and missiles, exposing nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Namun, we don't see any favorable responses from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there won't be any confidence in our national security and in such a situation there's no way that we're removing our own weapons first. "
While Ri repeats the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resturbing approach to pulverization in which North Korea would be punished for taking a gradual step, it was significant that they didn't completely refuse as much as Pyong was done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the peak meeting between the president of the United States and the first North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, at that time Kim promised "inculurization of Korea" while Trump promised North Korea's security guarantee.
The North Koreans have wanted an official expansion of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongang has to stop the nuclear weapon first.
Washington also refused the call to reduce the international weight bill to North Korea.
"The United States insisted on "deducturization first" and increased pressure by a semi-depressed gift to their purpose, and even rejected "the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that the decision can make us bend to our knees is an illusion of people who don't know about us.
However, the problem is that such a constant threat will enhance our disbelief."
Ri didn't mention plans for the second summit meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader was staged at the United States's union earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and adds: "If the issue of the problem in this uklitrization is South Korea and not the United States, it will not reach this kind of dead end."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech is dramaticly different than last year, when he spoke to the UN General Congregation that targeted North Korean rockets on the mainland of the United States is a thing that can't be eliminated after "Mr President of the Devil" Trump calls Kim "man rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations meeting, the Trump that last year threatened to “strengne ” North Korea in total, add praise to Kim for her courage to take her steps to chop off, but the big job still has to be done and the sentence must be carried out until North Korea was carried out.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months or no problem," he said.
Chinese and Russians claim that the U.S. Security Council must punish Pyongang for the step taken.
However, the U.S. Minister Mike Pompos, delivered to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, that "Punciation of the Security Council should continue firmly and not fail until we know that the enukrization is full, final, and verified."
The security board has been a round-up program for North Korea since 2006 as an effort to stop the expansion of nuclear programs and Pyongang ballage missiles.
Pompo met Ri at the U.S. General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit meeting.
Pompos had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last journey was not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July while he said that there was actually a progress, just North Korea in the amount of hours that he made "sturdents like gangsters."
The North Korean promised in a meeting with Moon this month to expose missile locations as well as nuclear complex if the United States took the "spective joke."
He declared that Kim told her to do the "responsible" with her desire is the security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and moved into normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students took courses on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students sleep more, in an effort to fight macho culture in learning that's growing through the owl's power of caffeine.
A academic found that students at university number one often don't know anything about the very fundamental thing about how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of specialized sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed course, which he believed was the first of his type in the U.S.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a college report on the effect of lack of sleep on the study.
'At last a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I just told now, in my last year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleep - which surprises me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The course that first launched this year, explained to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletically improve their public well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrists at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health care, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a student who was very chronically short of sleep during the week.
The course for an hour this involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there's a window of boarding rooms, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic results are affected by sleep shortages, and the importance of bedtime routine.
In other parts of the world, participants have an explanation about how long sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A college map, with an interactive icon, then encourage participants to think of their daily routine.
'We know this isn't going to change student behavior instance.
But we are sure that they have the right to know-- as much as you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes in health,' imbash Prof Czeisler.
The proud culture of "strenging" still exists, he says, plus that modern technology and increasing pressure on the student that means sleeplessness is an ever - growing problem.
Make sure you sleep well enough, with good quality, must be 'the secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, to say -- even to avoid reserving weight, because sleeplessness makes the brain activates hunger mode, fueling hunger.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old California who studied chemistry and physical biology that helped Professor Czeisler designed the course, took one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the whole college.
The next step, he hopes that the entire postgraduate student was instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider it to set the alarms of sleep, as well as alarms wake up, and realize the effect of the ‘ blue light' which is lit by electronic screens and LED lights, which can move your syrckadian rhythm out of the path so that it causes sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Goll is letting down the mental body of Gerrard
Again, Rangers felt the grief of the Dolly's attack while delivering Steven Gerard's team scattered about at the defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
Tim Hebox was trying to record their first victory on their way, since the February 4-1th victory in St. Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team had just given a second defeat for Gerard in 18 games as manager, causing his team to leave eight points of Ladbrokes Premiership Headship Hearts.
Attacking seven minutes before the first round is over and the ruled Rangers don't seem to be in sight.
While Rangers are now down to sixth position, Livingston goes to third position, just left behind the score of Hibernian.
And there could be further problems in Rangers' castle after the guard of Calum Spence had to be treated because the wound in the head after an object was thrown from the distance.
Gerard made eight changes on the team that's lips Ayr into the semifinal Betfred Cop.
On the contrary, Hold went with Livi 11 that took one point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with the costumes of their opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may dominate the possession of the ball, but Livingston makes use of the ball they have better.
They should've written score in two minutes when the first short bait was thrown by Scott Pitttman through the GGregor's goal, but it pulled that big chance too wide.
The deep free kick of Jacobs and the captain Craig Halkettt but his defense partner Alan Lithgow can only stab wide in the back position.
The Rangers take control but there seems to be more hope than confidence about their game at the third end.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he was supposed to get the penalty when he and Steven Lawless broke down on a quarter-hour sign but was waxit Steven Thomson refused to the extent of the people of Colombia.
The Rangers only managed to do two throws in the first round but the previous goal guard, Liam Kelly, had almost never had a problem with Lassian's head training and the attack of Ovie Edua that was easy to develop.
Although Livi's opening goal at the 21st minute may be opposite the way of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' deep ball tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball into Scott Robinson, who remained calm to vote for a simple end.
Gerard acted on his break by changing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and changing it almost gave direct impact as the wing player puts the ball on Morelos but Kelly was playing impressively out of line to push off.
But Livingston kept forcing the kick team to play exactly what they enjoyed, with Lilgow and Halkettt to sweep all the long balls.
The Hold team was supposed to expand their progress at the final stage but McGregor stood well to get Jacobs out before Lithgow runs wide from the corner.
The Third Rangers, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he was in conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face.
Almanac: The Discoverer of Geiger
And now from our "Sunday Morning Morning" page: September 30, 136 years ago today, and NASE ABBAH... the day of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "His" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which is a discovery that eventually makes the device called Geiger’s Sic.
Being a science device since then, Geiger's successor has also been a pop-inlan, as in the 1950 "Bells of Coronado," stared to cowboy scientists who seem less convincing than Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What's that thing?
Rogers: "It's Geiger's founder, used to find a radioactive mineral location, such as a sizeium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioakivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, it's gonna happen now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his sixth birthday.
But the discovery that kept her name alive.
New cancer vaccines teach immune system to ‘ identifying' wicked cells
New cancer vaccines teach imun system to 'make' bad cells and kill them
Vaksin taught an immune system to recognize wicked cells as part of medicine
His methods involve a process of extracting an immune cell from the patient, changing it in the lab
They can then get a common form of protein in many cancers and then they're re-synced again.
An experiment vaccine shows a promise to patients with various cancers.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which taught an immune system to recognize the evil cell, ovium cancer lost for over 18 months.
These methods involve the extracting of patients ’ immune cells, turning them in the laboratory so they can know the protein that is generally found in many cancers called drive2, and then retact those cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Society in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The fact that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stirring the growth of some kind of cancer," including breast cancer, ovium, lungs, and colorechal, Prof Berzofsky explains.
The same approach is like taking patients' cells and teaching them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one kind of leukemia.
Kany West started Ditribe Pro-Trump, wearing the MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
Not Walking Good
Kany West was sued in the studio for the Night Live after he turned up in a mess where he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said that he was going to run himself in 2020.
After bringing up that third night, called Ghost Town where he wore Mace America Great's hat, he challenged the Democrat party and repeated his support for Trump.
"How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America since long," she said.
SNL began the show with a performance that struck Matt Damon where the Hollywood star laughed at testimni Bvant Kavanugh in front of the Court's Yudisial Senate about the sex claim made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the West caci-maki footage was uploaded to social media by Chris Rock's comedian.
It's not clear if Rock's trying to make fun of West with the extinction.
In addition, West complains to the audience that he is having trouble behind the back of the stage because of his wearing hat.
"They kept me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't come out wearing that hat.'
They're watching me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "You want to see a place of drowning?" said that he's gonna wear Superman's robe, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
The comment results at least twice from the audience and the SNL actors, Variety reported, by one person saying, "The whole studio is shut."
West was brought in last moments as a substitute for Ariana Grande singer, a former rap singer named Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
The West confuses many people with her performance I Love it, dressed like Bot Perrier's bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the TPUSA conservative group, Cdace Turner who wrote tweet: "For one of the bravest souls: I love you has been living up to RAKYAT."
But Karen Hunter's shower wrote that West only "bes himself and that's really very nice."
"But I chose not to give someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "seni" that I believed joined and broke up a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
So do we.
Before the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that he's changed his name, saying that he's now "the officially known person of the Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change the name and follow Diddy's trail, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Addy.
As a rap singer, Sonoop Dogg gets the name Snoop Lion and certainly the legend of Prince's music, turns his name into a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

The Game Star of Thrones Kit Harington is critical of poisonous masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for sword swings in his role as Jon Snow in a medieval fantasy of HBO Game of Thrones.
But these actors, 31, amvenging macho hero stereots, he says that the role on the screen is what makes the children often feel that they have to be strong to be honored.
Talk to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says he's sure he's wrong' and questioning how to handle a bad masculinity problem in the era #MeToo.
Kit, who just married his opponent at Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, as well as 31, says he's feeling pretty strong on the issue.
'I feel personal, pretty powerful, right now-- where are we wrong with this masculinity thing?' he said.
'What do we teach men when we grow up, related to the matter we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the rise of an evil masculinity with its very masculinous characters.
He continues: 'Where is the character from birth and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the road, which makes boys feel that they have to have this certain side to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in this time-- how do we change it?
Because obviously there's something wrong with young people.'
In that interview he also admitted that he would not play in prekuels or Game of Thrones when this serial is going to end the next summer, saying that he's already working on the field of war and horses.
Since November Kit will revel his return of True West of Sam Shepard, that's the story of the film producer and his brother, who was a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, thus giving me a future family, and from here my life started' her face.
Rose plays Ygritte, Kit's character love flower, Jon Snow, in the series of fantasy winners of this Emmy award.
This couple were married in June 2018 in the home of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Oids: Chinese reporting 14% load new case
Chinese have announced 14% of the population that lives with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are infected in this country, says the health officer.
About 40,000 cases recently reported on the second quarter of 2018.
The new segment of cases is transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some Chinese parts as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people with HIV in this way has been reduced to nearly zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Yet, from year to year the number of those who live with HIV and Aids in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a acute problem in the LGBT Chinese community.
Homosexuality was decommed in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT people is called the worse.
Because of this country’s conservative value, study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many infectious diseases come from a sexual protection that is not powerful in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of the effort to handle the problem.
Maxine Waters argued that the staff had leaked GOP's senator data, spreading 'a dangerous lie' and 'theor conspiracy'
The United States of Maxine Waters on Saturday argued that one of his staff's staff had sent personal information to the U.S. Party of the United States's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat Party confirms that the claims are moved by experts and web sites "ultra-right wing".
"A lie, a lie, and a lot more nasty lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that the information released included the home address and the number of Senator Senatorsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
That information appeared online on Thursday, sent by strangers in Capitol Hill during the Senate panel congregation on the improper sexual abuse of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanugh.
This drill appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
A conservative site such as Gateway Putit and RedState reported that the IP address identified the sending source is connected to Waters' office and exposed one of the staff staff reports.
"It's not based on this really wrong and it's an absolute lie," continues Waters.
"My staff's staff -- who's an identity, personal information, and her safety is threatened by lying and wrong accusations -- is absolutely irresponsible of this leak of information.
This is indeed a false lie."
Waters ’ statement quickly attract online critics, including former Secretary of the White House named Ari Fleischer.
"This hold means anger," wrote Flycher.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be a Congressman.
They cannot even be offended if a person is falsely accused of something he has not done.
They must never go astray.
They shouldn't question the owner's motives.
They must be quiet and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters ’ reaction to democrat criticism of Judge Kavanough, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the head of the Republic, who is trying to reserve Waters at part-time votes, also expressing thoughts on Twitter.
"Bear if he's right," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the right influence and the intelligence of law enforcement about this wrong charge.
"We'll make sure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and they'll be accountable legally for all their acts that corrupt and dangerous for one and all my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson's spy is not good.
Now looking for the significance of Brexit in each new movie with British bis has become a tradition and it appears to occur for the reborn of the panaebon of Johnny English-- which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will sarcasm about how bad we're going to be a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English, whose eyes were inattentive, rubber - facing, and uncompressed has updated his license to screw up all things for the second time that his name gives more than anything that he is a vast comic creation designed for the language without England.
Surely he's a crazy secret agent who, regardless of his strange assumption, has a little bit of a Clouseau character, a sereneau character sequence Mr Bean and a few desertes that contributed a little note for Chariots of Fire at the London Olympic ceremony 2012 opening ceremony.
Indeed, he was based on the international tourists and men who once played Atkinson at the Barclaycard TV commercials that are now forgotten, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two sweet moments on this new JE trip.
I like it when Johnny English comes near the helicopter by wearing a middle - century dress and a spina-bolor field quickly attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for a physical diet was displayed, but his humor felt less powerful and too weird, especially when the brand of "serius" was like 007 and Mission Imposcible had believed to put in the food in as material.
The Human feels like it's meant for children than adults, and for me some weird Johnny English abuses are not as negative and asphocule movie-bisu Atkinson jokes in Bean's personality.
The hot Premissing for years is that England is in serious trouble.
A synops have entered the super-secret English spy network, exposed the identity of all British agents in the field, to disappoint an agent who's in charge -- unfortunately just a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the proud, hostile prime minister, who has already ruined his total popularity in politics: Emma Thompson has been very good with quasi-May characters but not much of how much can be developed from his script.
His clever counselor gave the information that because every active spy has been weakened, he has to take someone out of his retirement period.
And that means that Johnny English's shell itself, now being hired as the principal in some fancy buildings, but teaching a secret lesson about how to perform undercover surgery: there's some great joke here, when English offers the spy academy like School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunited with an old friend who had suffered a long time, followed by Ben Miller again.
Bourgh is now married, married to a sub commander, the role of the high-class woman who sucks where Vicki Pepperdine is rather blocked.
So Batman and Robin made a mistake on His Majesty's Secret Agent back in action, meeting a beautiful mysterious woman named Ophelia Bullettova that Olga Kurylenko came along with.
In the meantime, the prime minister was worried about falling into the influence of a career-magic technology that claims could solve the problem of the British computer: evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bouga began their ridiculous adventure: undercover as a waitress, they burned a fast French watch restaurant; they made a mess by exposing themselves to a luxury ship Volta; and English triggered anarchki when he tried to use the Virtual Realset to get used to interior Volta's house.
All stops must be pulled for the last period, but with hospitality and strife like that, there's a little TV channel that's filled about everything.
A pretty modest thing.
And as another Johnny English film, I can't think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that is really appropriate for his talent?
Bust of arguing about plans for the British to work four days a week but paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of the United States considered a radical plan that wants the British to work four days a week-- but paid five days.
The United States reportedly wanted company owners to continue the result of dementing through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) for workers by giving them extra days off.
He'll let employees enjoy the weekend three days-- but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea will be 'pass' with party economic agendas and plans encourage the country to support the workers.
A four - day transition has been approved by the British Dagang Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefit of economic change.
A source, which is the senior of the Bust United States told The Sunday Times: 'The presence of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'It's not going to happen last night, but four days of work in a week is an aspiration that corresponds to the party approach to balance the economy that supports the business workers and business strategy of the party as a whole.'
The Bukur party isn't the first to support that idea, because Green Party has promised four days of work in a week's election campaign in 2017.
But the current aspiration is not supported by the entire Bust Party.
The partyman said: 'A quarter work days a week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
John McDonnell's Bayelir used his conference last week to complete his vision for socialist revolutions in the economic field.
McDonnell said he's determined to take back the power of an anonymous ‘director' and a catuter' at the utilities company.
This shade plan also means, the current shareholder in the drinking water company may not get the whole stock back because the government of the Bust party can do an imploding.
He also made sure that his plan was to put the workers at the company council and create the Inklusive Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's content in private sectors to employees, which would have passed in years to pounds of500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation on Kavanugh can change their view
The FBI investigation of the charge against Judge Bret Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his decisators in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and has raised the question of whether this beer interview could affect the senators of the Republic's Party to remove their support.
In an interview shown on Sunday, Mr. Scott Pelley asked Senator of the Republic Party. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, can the FBI find something that could make them change their mind.
Looks like Kennedy's opener than his partner from South Carolina.
"My parents, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, that accusation appeared, and said, 'You did it?'
He is firm, firm, firm."
But Graham doesn't seem to be able to change his voice.
"My generation has set a decision about Stret Kavanough, and needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know what's going on is: Beatt against it very hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he named his name cannot verify him.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What does Global Citizen Festival mean and has this event done something to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday, New York will hold Global Citizen Festival, a annual music show that shows a highly impressive score of stars, and a very effective mission; end poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, Global Citizen Festival would be witnesses of tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the actions of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of this event’s purpose in reality to end extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, was a continuing group of Global Food Project, an international interactive group that hoped would end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to the show (unless you want to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors have to complete a series of tasks or "actions" like volunteers, send an email to world leaders, call, or other ways that means to help build awareness of their purpose to end poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been for 12 years in reaching his goal?
Does the idea of giving a gift of free concerts is the right way to get people to perform an act, or is it just another case called "clictivistm" -- people feel like they're making a real difference with signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said that it has been recorded more than 19 million "actions" from his supporters, pushing to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped to supply world leaders to announce commitments and policys equal to over $137 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has gathered 390 commitments and announcements that come from their actions, at least $10 billion of them have been shed or done fundrais.
This group estimates safe funds so far that it has directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the major commitments between The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based on England that was made up of the investers and high - decided to "help children grow up to their maximum potential," promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end the country's malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4.,700 tweet from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, conservation, national government, and Global Citizen like you, we can make social injustice about this lack of nutrition to be a record of feet in history," High Commissioner of Nutrition, Tracey Ulman told people at the concert in London in April 2018.
This group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were done to improve nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrients.
Considering one question at the General Answer on their web site who asked "What makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global kitilzen said: "This will be a long and difficult path-- sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just like a civil rights movement and a great anti-apatheid existing before us, we'll make it, because if we're united we're going to be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janeelle Monáe is among the stars that perform this year in New York, which will be driven by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy as "locade" to hinder Russian energy export - Secretary of the State
"If it's necessary" Washington can help the Navy to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as Washington Examiner is quoted.
Zinke strongly suspected that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it operates on the legitimate government invitation-- is an excuse to explore a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be energy makelar, just as they did in eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reported.
And according to the office, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the seaway is open, and, if necessary, to do blockade, to make sure that their energy cannot get into the market," he says.
Zinke spoke in front of the participants held by Consumen energy aliens, a group of secularists who called herself "a sound of energy customers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to a deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they are the same.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia is less than, using and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one "the expert in the field" with the economy that depends on fossil fuel.
This statement showed up when Trump government representative was doing a mission in order to increase their space gas exports into Europe, instead of Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, the U.S. government officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade the Germans to draw themselves off the 2rd Starm oil plant project, which says Trump, made Berlin a "watan" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nord Starm 2 - worth 1.1 billion oil - oil oil factory project, designed to double the capacity of oil pipelines up to 110 billion feet [110 billion m] of this joint, is pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's severe resistance to this project is merely motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we had the same view that energy could not be a tool for pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own supplier," said Russian Secretary Ale complyr Novak, after the meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has attracted the reactions of Germany, which has confirmed their commitment to this project.
The German industry’s leading industry, the Federation of Germanytrines (BDIs), has asked the U.S.A. not to interfere with European energy policy and the oral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I'll face a big problem if the third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Ferderation of Germanys (BDI) after the recent meeting between the German newspaper Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will see the situation when the President will be president in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts.
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he would see the situation when running as a president after a part-time vote.
When the town hall was on Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren assured him he would consider taking care of himself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, including putting women in the top position, as he said to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'll see the situation when I run the president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while filming at the city hall, saying that he's "bringing this region to the wrong direction.
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's been talking about his criticism to Trump and the future head of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before doing a vote."
However, a sense of opinion released on Thursday, suggests that most of the Warren’s constituent itself did not want him to run on 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of the "cert" voter in Massachusetts said it's better for senators not to run off, according to Suffolk University Polical Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent who support the callers.
The opinion shows more support for former Governor Deval Patrick than for ruling, with 38 percent who support the possibility of accessing himself and 48 percent against it.
Other important names in the Democrat Party discussed with the possibility of setting themselves up in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Bden said he'd officially decide it in January, Assocated Press reporting.
Sarah Palin quoted PTSD Track Palin during Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26 years, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with a violent incident in the house on Monday night.
"What my son is going to face when he comes back, I can relate to another family that also feels the consequences of PTSD and some wounds that our soldiers face," he said in front of those present on the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Okoma.
Palin called his arrest like "specture in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they returned a little different, they came back a little harder, they came back and wondered if there was respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and warriors and any other military members to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, plus a report of violence in the house and possession of arms in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, the director of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support the challenge of law to new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims who escape gangs or violence in the household.
The company of 18 states and the district has filed friends-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support those weakas challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of Grace v's constituent in the session that American Civil Liberiles Union in August against federal policy has not yet been revealed.
He said that his partner "and his son who was a member of a violent gang," had abused him, but the U.S. officials had refused his weak request for July 20th.
He's been held in Texas.
The country crime that supports Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced only a huge U.S. firm for the U.S., as a country that faces great problems with gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. state policy left behind with the decision of the Council of Immigrans in 2014 that allowed dark immigrants to escape domestic violence to file asylum.
Prosecutor District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy is "disputed state law, federal, and internationally established for decades."
"The federal law requires that all Scripture claims should be decided according to certain facts and conditions related to the claims, and such prohibitions violate principles," the friends-of-the court brief said.
Further modesty suggests that the policy that refuses to enter the United States's economic loss, says that it is likely that they will become businessmen and "smask necessary labor."
Prosecutor Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered an immigration judge no longer to feed victims who fled violence in homes and gang atrocities.
"Aka is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear that are caused by racial, religious, national, or social, or political opinion," Seseses said it in the announcement of this policy on June 11th.
Suaka is not meant to ease all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- what people face every day around the world.
A very sad relief effort on the hammer because the victim doubles to race in time to find a safe victim
For those who survive, the situation is getting worse.
"The taste is very intense," said the Kasuma, a 35 - year - old mother, soothing her baby who is in the refugee center of the devastated city of the hammer.
"Every minute an ambulance comes with a dead body.
The clean water is very rare."
The citizens look back to their ruined homes, took all the watery things, tried to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and treated in a hospital, the damage caused by a 7.5 earthquake, was very messed up.
Some of them injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken spine and shoulders, lay outside the Wooden Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the room because of a strong milk earthquake.
Her tears flow as she described her feelings back when an earthquake shook the fifth - floor hotel room where she stayed with her wife and daughter.
"No time to save himself.
I think I'm stuck in the ruins of the wall, "The Days told Assaded Press, he added his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then she fell quiet.
I didn’t know what my condition and my son were.
May they survive."
The big U.S. Duta accuses China' of making an ally' with a propaganda check.
A week after the official newspaper of China contains a four - page commercial in a U.S. daily which calls the profit of U.S. trade-Tiger, the U.S. High Commissioner for China accused Beijing of using the American press to deliver propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday was referring to the Chinese payment of China Daily in Des Moines Register - the best newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China to try to interfere in the S.S. Congress election on the March 6th., an accusation disputed by China.
Trump's claim that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election, marking what the U.S. officials said to Reuters, was a new phase in the expansion of Washington's campaign to press China.
While something common to foreign governments to put advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now being forced into a growing trade war, which has made them increase in import rates.
The price of China's revenge at the beginning of this trade war was designed to hit exports in such a state as Iowa who supported the Party of the Trump Republic, said Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. High Commissioner for China and the former governor leading Iowa, the main export of farm goods to China, says Beijing has cost workers, farmers, and business guys in America.
Chinese, Branstad wrote an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now double the harassment by running advertising ads in our own free media."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of a highly valued speech tradition and press freedom in America by holding a paid commercial in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, at the newsstands of street newspapers here, in Beijing, you'll find a barrier to different voices and will not see the real mirror on a different opinion that the Chinese may have of the troubled Chinese economy, considering the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in China refused offer to publish" articles, although he didn't mention which newspaper.
Analysing, the Republic’s Party Avoids the Selection of Women by the Time Choice of the Kavanaugh Disaster
Because of the important people in the Republic of Republic who stand up and defend the head of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanough in the face of some sexual charges, analysis has warned that they will see the attack back, especially from women, at the general election of time to come.
The emotion for this matter is very high, and most members of the Republic have been described as showing that they want to move on to the vote.
That could not be prevented. Grant Reeher, a professor of political science in Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator's urge to push Jeff Flake at the end of minutes to do the FBI investigation will be enough to ease the anger on the voter.
"Wints won't forget what happened yesterday-- they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and a national speaker for MoveOn's progress group said it on Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning the demonstrantators shouted "November is close!" when they do a demonstration at the Senate hall when the Republic's Party controls the Justice Committee to go forward in Kavanaugh's office off the testimony of Dr. Christine Bresey Ford, Mic reported.
"Stu Rothenberg political analysts, tell the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women's voters in the outer regions and voters younger, 18 to 29 years, who because they don't like president, often don't give a voice."
Even before the Ford public testimony that detailed sexual harassment against himself was given by the future head of the Supreme Court, an analysis of an assault was on the following if the Republic’s Party was moving on to advance with confirmation.
"It's a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republic's National Committee, early last week, to the NBC News.
"It's not only about the election committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how the Republic Party handled this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Prioriririies USA, which helps choose the Democrat Party, points to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be split up about who should be trusted after a testimony from Ford and Kavanugh, with a little more sides to the last.
A new opinion feature that YouGov did show that 41 percent of the respondents actually believe or might believe in Ford testimony, while 35 percent said they really believed or might believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt that Kavanaugh might or actually lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said something similar about Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges that Ford and one other downloader, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford witnessed under oath before the Senate Court that Kavanaugh was in a drunk state had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the future head of the Supreme Court showed him his cock when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Became planning to start New Internet to deal with Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the founder of World Wide Web, launched a beginningup that tried to filter up Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inupt, is a company built from a source platform open Berners-Lee, Solid.
Soid allows users to choose where they're stored and who's allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, playing Berners-Lee said that the meaning behind the Inupt was "domination of the world."
"We have to start now," he said from starting.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses the Solid technology that allows people to create their own personal online data reserves or their own PD.
This can contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional devices.
Like Google Drive, ek Outlook, Slack, and Spotty were all available in one rower and everything at the same time.
What's unique of this personal online data storage is that it's totally up to the user who can access what kind of information.
In the company known as "a personal skill through data."
The idea of establishing Inupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce's company, is that the company makes use of resources, processes, and proper skills in order to help Sorid is available to everyone.
This company is now made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some staff developers who are under obligation to work projects, and the codemaker community.
Starting this week, the global technology developer can create an application for personal decoding using a tool available on the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team weren't talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a total change in which all of their business models will actually be reversed in the night.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post on the Medioum that was published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "infrupt's emissions are to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built above Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he set up World Wise Web Consoticium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee have become a powerful voice in the neutrality of tissue debate.
Even as I launch Inupt, Berners-Lee will remain behind and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Remember WW1 Victoria Cross scholar
The only member of the Church in England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior, was reminded of his birth in 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, for the attack at Bellengly and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by snipers and never knew that he had won the highest military privilege.
A memorial stone was taken by two of his grandsons at a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "imbolth of intelligence" that would reveal exactly 100 years his grandfather's achievement won his award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his cancelion across the Channel de Saint-Qhangin "stacking thick fog under fire from field guns and machines."
Then he rushed forward to the combat line and with the "the greatest courage" to lead the front lines before he rushs on his own field weapons and paralyzes three finessemen.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's action was something I knew I wouldn't be able to live but it was a very humble act.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a flower essay after the parade, led by Brentwood Irelenial Youth band.
Michael Vann says he's very proud to participate in these parades and adds "the courage of a true hero is being shown by the support that many will be given."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've been up all night to watch the crowded 206 Bellator just to refuse to watch the main show.
The charge of San Jose contains 13 fights, including six on the main cards and is being shown directly all night in England on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., right when Gegard Moustation and Rory MacDald were preparing to face each other, the audience in England was made to appear when his lips turned into Peppa Pig.
Some feel that they're not appreciated after they're up to a special day for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the turn of children's cartoons as "corruptious love."
"This is government policy, that at 6:00 a.m. content is not suitable for showing, so replaced by the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and Bellator communication, when asked about the transmission.
""Pope the pig," yes."
President Bellator Scott Coker said that they'd fix their schedule by taking an audience in the future in England.
"I think, if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," said Coker.
"But right now there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until our Sunday, on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of change, a lot of text and everything is not educational.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government issue.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce up to five fights of the six-- as we usually did-- and we're going to try to avoid overdoting for fans, and we're successful.
This is an unsustainable state."
Out Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'low' related to sexuality problems
The Olympic explorer Tom Daley said he grew up with a low self - esteem because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize that until he entered high school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time at Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, she said, she was talking about the rights of gay people to give the "hope" to others.
He also said that being an old man made her less concerned to win the Olympics.
The average show driver brought this long-time event, Kirsty Young, taking a few months off of his illness.
Tampil as the people who were parked on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less compared" all the others who grew up with him because "it's not a social acceptable thing to love men and women."
He said, "The heart of this day is less than the other, and the feeling, has become the real things that give me power and strength to make it work."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let everyone down when they knew about his sexual issues.
The two Olympic bronze medals have become the famous LGBT campaign chairman and use its appearance in Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said, he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give the "hope" to others.
The third time the world champion said that he was in love with a movieman from the U.S. Dustin Lance Black, whom he found in 2013 - "sclaimed me."
Daley married an Oscar who was 20 years older than he was this last year, and he said that age absence was no problem.
"When you're having so many problems at a very young age"-- she followed her first Olympic at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later-- she said it was very difficult to find someone with the same age who had a similar high-destrescretion.
This couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Dalley, and Daley said "all his perspectives" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all around 'I had to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as Robert’s father, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked is whether they'd get tickets to London Olympic 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'You won't sit in the front row of father'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he was invincible," he said.
The next year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I dreamed of all my life-- to dive in front of the crowd in the Olympics, there's no feeling better than that," he said.
It also inspires the first - Proud by Heather Somall - who has joined her in preparing for the Olympics and still makes it fun.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast that was broadcast on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson changes the role while assigned to Ryder Capp on Saturday
The U.S. manifest Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays Ryder Capp to47, but he has to change his role to avoid unpleasant accomplishments.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year-old event to record a 12th record, was assigned by Captain Jim Furyk for the four ball games and four groups on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he usually did for the United States, the primary winner of five times divides the time between being a preacher and doing the game in that range, with hope to fix what he's been trying to do.
Never be the most straight golf bat, though on the top of his career, this 48-year-old man is not suitable to take a very strict course in Le Golf National, which is a routine of giving a long and rude punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it's not scary enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, facing the most accurate English champion Francesco Molinri, who has been working with the new arrival Tommy Fletetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American analf, start 12 single games with four points below, start with a hot start, then Mickelson's game proves very important.
Furyk claims faith in this guy, not because he can say a lot of other things.
"He really understands his role today, bends my back and embrace me, and says he'll be ready for tomorrow's game," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He was Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine the others, but that's how they play and that's the way we think we should go through.
He wants to enjoy another setting, just like most people."
Mickelson's going through Nick Falldo's record for the most played Ryder cup, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cop that would never refer to the height of his individual record.
Mickelson's going on 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven times series, even though Furyk said his presence was carrying some things that cannot be said on the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's joking, likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he said.
"I think younger players have fun with him, this week too, which is pretty fun to see.
He's given a lot more than just playing."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big shock could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from the experience that someone leading large enough to his last single match at Ryder Capp could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane did his first dust at the 1997 match in Valderrarara, with the captain of team Seve Ballsteros holding the five points above the United States, but just touched the finish line with their noses with the most thin margins, won 1412-131.
"You keep reminding yourself that we're getting a big seizure in Valderrara; we're getting a big band in Brookline, where we lose, and in Valderra, where we win, but just," said Bjorn, after watching Class of 2018, won 5-3 good on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 on the National Golf.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that's not over.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring game.
Come out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a target, and the target is winning this trofi, and that's the focus.
I've been saying, I've been focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side of the world."
It's nice to see the players playing in a hard golf field, Bjorn added: "In this case I'll never move forward by myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players are about to move forward, and this is a different thing to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when everything goes well, but if you're out there playing personally, then your ability is completely as a golf player will be tested.
That's the message you have to tell all the players, get the best out of yourself for tomorrow's game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they do as partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the last day of the big game, has been part of a team that won in Brookline before ending with the defeat when Europe did "The Fire in Medicine."
"I remember every word that," she answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, united his players to the last day.
"We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start quickly as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medinnah.
When the clock runs one way, it'll give a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in various ways we think, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the struggle against Rory McIroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fletwood, and Ian Poulter, another European player is in top order.
"I went with this bunch of people in order like this because I think I could close all the way," said Bjorn about his single option.
The new German warship was suspended again
The new German Navy ship should have started on duty in 2014 to replace an old Cold Warship, but it wouldn't be there at least until the next year because of the wrong system and the increased cost, local media reported.
The "Rheinland-Palalz", the primary ship of Baden-Weuertemberg class, has now been suspended until the first half of the year 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit who quoted the military speaking.
This ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but delivery problems had bothered the fate of this ambitious project.
The four fourth class ships of Baden-Weuertemberg that had been ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come as the successor of an old Bremen class escort.
This ship will be equipped with strong cannons, a series of anti-sager missiles, and anti-ship missiles, and some demon technology, such as radar removers, infrared, and analytic key.
Another important feature included longer treatment periods - should be allowed to use the latest bodyguards for two years away from the port.
However, the delay constantly means this sophisticated warship -- which is said to allow Germany to highlight its power abroad - it would be worn out when it began to enter the time of his duty, Die Zeit recorded.
A bad F125 guard ship had become a preacher last year, when the German Navy officially refused to send the ship back to the Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipman after the delivery.
Just a few of the reasons known behind the ship's return, but the German media quotes a number of "spective software and hardware" that makes the warship useless if used for battle missions.
It's a very important software paint because Baden-Weertemberg class ship will be operated by ship crews made up of 120 sailors -- only half of the labor on the older Bremen class.
The knowledge also that the weight of the ship would reduce its performance and limit the power of the Navy to add updates in the future.
"Rheinland-Palalz" with bobot 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as a ship with a similar class of Germans used in World War II.
Besides damaged hardware, the production costs of the entire project - including the crew training are also a problem.
It was said to rise in surprise to 3 to 1,1 billion ($3.6 billion) - rising from the beginning of 172 billion.
The problem of being held by this new bodyguard became very important in considering the latest warning because of the damage to the forces of the German Navy.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament committee admitted that the Navy was actually "out of ships with spread capacity."
He said that as time went on, the old ships were no longer used but had no substitute ships provided.
He's sorry that not one of Baden-Wuertemberg's guards could join the Navy.
National Trust listened to the secret life of bat secretly
The new research was done on a farm in Scotland's High Data, which was designed to expose the way bats used nature in their hunting.
Guess this discovery will give a new light on this unique flying mammal behavior and help guide future conservation activity.
The team that scientists do in National Trust for Scotland will follow the general and sophreran cheekels and long brown bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity all season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using self - destructive detectors.
The sound bar that analyzes all footage will ensure the frequency of bat calls and species which are doing what activity is.
Then maps and habitat reports will be made to create an image on a scale of nature measuring out about their behavior.
Rob Godr, natural conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that this results will reveal which habitat is most important to bats and how each species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of the habitat management work such as making grasslands and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and all over England has been slow down in the last few centuries.
This route is threatened by a work of development and development that affects nests and loss of habitat.
Winds and lighting tourists are also at risk, such as the sticky paper hung on to trap bats and chemical care of building matter, as well as the attack from a pet cat.
The bat is not blind, actually.
However, because of the custom of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes in the matter of catching prey.
They're using advanced echo-track techniques to find insects correctly and barrier on their flight path.
NTS, who is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, is very concerned about bats.
Have ten trained experts, who regularly do surveys, nest scans, and sometimes attempt to save.
It has also set up the first and only natural reserve in Scotland on Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson's farm manager said farming was a suitable area for bats.
"Here in Threave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, lots of old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there are still many things we don't know about bats, so, the work we do here and the other property will help us to understand more about what they need to develop."
He emphasized the importance of reviewing bats before doing maintenance inside the property, because without realizing it, there is a possibility that one birth den can kill up to 400 female bats and that young ones, who might destroy the entire local population.
Its habitat is protection and murder, harassment, or harassment, or destroying its nest is illegal.
Elisabeth Frell, the Scotland's official for the Trust Stravation of the Trust beetle, had encouraged the public community to come and help.
He said: "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and for many of our species that we don't know how their population's fate is."
Ronaldo who refuses to claim rape is setting up a lawyer to demand German magazines
Kristeno Ronaldo called his claim of rape over himself as "false news," and said that people want to promote themselves" by using their name.
His lawyer will demand that German news reports Der Spiegel, which applied the charges.
The Portuguese winner and Juventus were accused of rapeing an American woman, named Karthryn Majorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then thought he had paid it by giving me $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reporting on Friday.
Speaking on live video Instagram to 142 million of his followers after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33 years, deaning that report as “false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is fake news," winner Ballon d'or five this time said it to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's a normal thing.
They want to be famous by calling me my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player adds with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the charges, which they call "reportion in an unacceptable privacy field," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz's lawyer said it would be asking for compensation as "a further moral loss in the number that is according to the weight of the violation, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
The incident that was accused occurred in June 2009 in a Swedish room in Pamms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga were reported back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped him, according to a report presented at Clark's Supreme Court Court in Nevada.
Major says Ronaldo was down on his knees after the incident he was accused and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who failed only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo confirmed that they were both having sexual relations, but it was on the basis of desire together.
Majorga also said he went to the police station and had done vice on his wounds in the hospital, but then agreed to resolve the problem outside of the court because he felt "fear of revenge" and worried "would be humiliated in public."
This 34-year-old woman said she's now trying to undo the peace solution because she's constantly having trauma for the incident she was accused of.
Ronaldo almost joined the Real Madrid of Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italian club Juve with a 100% million deal.
Brexit: England ‘ will regret forever' for the loss of the carmakers
The British "will regret forever" if he loses his status as world leader after Brexit, says Greg Clark's business secretary.
He added "toyota" Toyota, England had told BBC that if the British came out of the European Union without an agreement, for a while would stop production at his factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car maker said the effects of border delay if there were no deals would have cost Brexit on duty.
The plant in Burkonston - who made Auris and Avensis production Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year at 90% were exported across the European Union.
"Can I be if England comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we'll see the stop of production in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's office in Burkon.
Another British car producer has expressed their concerns about the exit of the European Union without an agreement on how trade will go, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem related to what those carmakers said is the risk of the supply chain if there's no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production lines run according to the principle of production "a time row", with spare parts that come in every 37 minutes of suppliers in England and Europe for cars that are made according to order.
If the British were to come out of the European Union without an agreement on March 29, there might have been a disturbance on the border, which the industry said could cause delay and a lack of spare tribe.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day in her factory at Derbyshire, says company representative, and then production will be stopped.
Clark says Chequers Theresa May's plans for a relationship with the European Union in the future are "discreced correctly to avoid checking at the border."
"We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I'm saying not only to enjoy success at this moment but for us to gain this opportunity," he said to Today program from BBC Radio 4.
"It's not only from Toyota but also other producers, that we really have to be able to continue what has already become a chain of supply that's already going very well."
Toyota can't say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long term, it's been clear to warn that the demand will reduce factory salting and will eventually be costing in the cost of the job.
Peter Tsouvalridis, who has been working in Burkonston for 24 years and is a unit member at the factory, says his crew is getting more worried: "Like my experience, once this job goes off, it will never come back again.
The governmentman said: "We have filed the right and reasonable plans for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be back delayed, the White House.
A high risk meeting of Donald Trump with the vice president of the Great prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "reveloped again a week" because of the contest of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanugh still continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is watching the work of special advisors Robert Mueller, who are investigating Russian intervention in general elections, relationships between soldiers and Russians, and potential to block justice from the president.
Is Trump gonna fire the vice president or not, which would endanger Mueller's freedom, have triggered the gossip in Washington for months.
The beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a telegram to record a conversation with Trump and possibly put the president through the 25th safe.
Rosenstein argued against the report.
But on Monday, she went to the White House, in the middle of the report that she was going to resign.
On the other hand, the meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump says he's going to "prove to not" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting's been delayed to avoid contact with the Senate committee congregation where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blansey Ford, both will testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week for the claims on Kavanaugh, which was next to delay the regular vote of the Senate.
The Trump press Secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared to Fox News Sunday.
She asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "It's not set for the meeting, it can be this week, I can see that I've been sending it to another week, and I can also remember the things that happen in the high court.
But let's see, and I've always wanted to deliver the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will oppose that statement: Sanders haven't had a press meeting in the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace's show driver asked him why.
Sanders said it's rare to meet not because they don't like TV journalists who are trying to draw attention, though, he said, "I don't agree with the fact that they're trying to draw attention."
Then he proposed direct contact between Trump and the press to increase.
"President did more direct questions than the previous president," he added without mentioning evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, says Sanders, but "If the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it more often and you've seen us do it a lot in the past few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can speak to the president of the United States."
The regular truck asked questions while leaving the White House or participating in an open session or a press conference with the visiting high officials.
Sun press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show you why, do free looks and sometimes weird before the reporters gather.
Health Secretary wrote to European Union workers in NHS Scotland about worry about Brexit problems
The secretary of Health has written a letter to the European Union staff who works at the NHS Scotland to express gratitude for the country and hope that they will still work here after Brexit's problem.
Jeane Freeman PSP sent a letter in less than six months until England pulled from the European Union.
The province of Scotland has been committed to pay for a fixed status rate for European citizens who work in a new public service.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between England and Europe about this dancer still continue, approaching the decision expected in this fall.
But the British government has also been ready for possible consequences of deals.
I know this must have been very disturbing to you all.
That's why I'd like to back up how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The contract of the entire European Union, as well as the other, brought on the experience and precious skills that increased health care and benefited from our services for patients and the community we served.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie runs emergency Operations after the Head flag
The back of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after having a head injury at the loss of 31-27 of Vanderbildores on Saturday, Mike organ of Tennesse reported.
The head coach of the state of Tennessee, Rod Reed told the injured journalist it happened shortly before the round ended.
"He came to the side of the field and fell unconscious there," said Reed.
Training and medical energy gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the side of the field before putting it in the store and taking him for further evaluation.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that "no detail about the type of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happens.
Abercrombie, this second-level student of these red shirts, was in the first season with the state of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five ankles on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made his total ankles during this season to 18 ankles.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher value on buying property in England
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher value when they buy property in England, with additional money that will be used to help the homeless according to the new Tory plan
This move will hold the success rate of Corbyn's movement in pulling young voters
It'll be put on the bill to those who don't pay taxes in England.
The Money Department estimates to gather up to 320 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be wearing higher peppers when they buy property in England-- and the extra money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to withstand Jeremy Corbyn’s success rate in pulling young votes with a promise will provide a more reliable housing and target higher income.
It will cost individuals and companies who don't pay taxes in Britain, along with additional money that encourages the government’s efforts to fight homeless.
Additional fees — which are additional costs at the cost of the time, including higher levels introduced two years ago to the purchase of the second home and the purchase of a rent - can reach three percent.
The Department of Money expects this movement to rise to 820 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new property built in London was bought by non-Inggriss, which caused a price rise and made it harder for the first buyer to set his foot on the estate.
Many rich areas in this country -- usually in the capital of the city -- have become a ‘ ghost town ’ because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy went out just a week after Boris Johnson called for a price cut to help more young people have their first home.
He accused the large construction company to maintain a high estate price by buying the land but not using it, and he urged Mrs. May to ignore the installment of the homes to repair the "vads" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of reform proposals in interesting housing areas, including rental surveillance and an end to "no guilt".
He also wanted to give more power to the board to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: "In the past I promised I would dedicate the prime minister's office to restore England's dream-- that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our poor housing market.
The British will always be open to those who want to stay, work, and build life here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in England, as well as foreign - based companies, to buy easy homes of British people who have worked hard.
For many dreams to have a house to be so far away, and the shameful treatment of the homeless remains manifest."
Jack Ross: 'My main occupation is leading the Scotland team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross said "the main change" is to become a Scotland manager in some stages.
This 42-year-old Scotland player, enjoys the challenge of re-bringing the North-East club, which is currently in the third rank in League One, three points of top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scotland Premier League last season.
"I want to see my country as a player.
I got B's hat and that's it," Ross told sportssound, BBC Scotland.
"But I'm big and often watching the Scotland team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it's always been something interesting to me to come back.
However, the opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Manager Sunderland before Ross, between Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo in Canio.
This former boss Alloa Athletic said he wasn't afraid to follow a trail of big names in that big club, after earlier rejecting an offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success at this moment will be measured by 'Can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facility in this club, no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I might just see myself as the man who's working here, if I can bring this club back there."
Karier Ross in team management for only three years, after a while as a boss assistant in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coach staff in Hearts.
And then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to third position, and turned St. Mirren from the collapse of degradation into the winner of the Champion in the next season.
And Ross says he's feeling more comfortable now than he's ever done during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a cross-track that I have to go through," he's up to taking over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I'm fine, making a living normally, and enjoying some reasonable things.
But playing can be difficult.
A lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still experiencing the pressure of work, but in management it feels fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt in my adult life."

During summer summer waves have increased Uub-pub incomes in England struggling to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
The numbers show, the pibs and bar groups saw a 2.7 - percent sales rate in July-- but income in restaurants is 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, the CGA business consultant, who set up those numbers, said: "The sun's rising sun and English participation in the world’s longer than expected means, the July will follow the same pattern as June, where the piub income rose by 2.8 percent, except the restaurant that gets hard enough.
It's going down by 1.8 percent restaurant trade in June will get worse in July.
The pub and bar that sold the drink so far were most powerful than what happened to the restaurant that went down.
The Pub that sells food also suffers because of the heat of the sun, though not as hot as the restaurant operator.
Looks like people just came out for a drink.
It's all over the barrels and bars that sell drinks up 6.6 percent for this month, with those who sell food down three percent."
Paul Newman, analysis of recreation and RM hotel says: "This thing continues the trend we've seen since April.
The weather and the impact of social events or big sports are still the biggest factor in selling the market outside the house.
No wonder that restaurant groups continue to fight to survive, despite a drop of 4.8 percent from year to year will be very painful on the costs that are currently taking place.
The long summer shouldn't have come when the operator who sells food is having bad times, and the time will tell us if the weather is good enough that we've enjoyed in August will give you a little needed rest."
The total growth of sales all over the pubs and restaurants, including the new opened, is 2.7 percent in July, showing the launch of the brand launch.
The sale of Coffer Peach Tracker's industry for the pub sectors, bars, and restaurants in England gather and analyze the performance data of 47 groups that are operating, with a combination of more than 17 pounds [0.9 billion], and it's the industry's never able to get rid of it.
One out of five children has a secret social media account they hide from their parents
Survei reveals, one of five children - some of them is only 11 years old -- having a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers
Survei against 20,000 middle school students revealed the development of the "false Insta" page
This news has added to the concern of being posted for sexual content
Twenty percent of the students say they have an account "first" to show parents
One in five children is still 11 years old - making social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
Survei against 20,000 middle school students reveals rapid development of "false Insta's accounts" - a reference to sites sharing photos in Instagrams.
That news has added to the concern of being posted for sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say they operate the original account to show the parents, while also have personal accounts.
A mother who discovered her 13 - year - old daughter's secret site found a teenager who asked for someone else to "my conscience."
A study conducted by the British Medical Services and the Head of the School of Men's School and Head of the Women's School from independent schools, found 40 percent of the students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
Head HMC, Mike Buchanan says: "It's disturbing so many teenagers trying to create an online room that their parents and teachers can't find."
The Volume Doyle will be the "sword to the athletes" at the Scotland Atletic Council
The Volume Doyle has been chosen to enter the Scotland Atletic council as a non-ecutive director at the service annual meeting of the manager's council.
Doyle was the most highly regarded track and field of Scotland and the head of Ian Bettie described as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from various experiences in international levels over the past few decades.
"The volume is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and athletic community, and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit by bringing it into the council," said Bettie.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for athletes and I hope that it can really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The U.S. athletic Atlet, who won a run of 200 feet and 400 feet at the 1996 Olympic Olympics in Atlanta between four total gold medals of the Olympics and now became a BBCist, now can't walk after an introductory attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day a month ago I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time can determine if I can recover again and to what level of recovery is.
It's a very exhausting job to recover fully, learn how to walk, and today do some kind of training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The breast pump that compares mother to cow has split up opinions in the online world
The breast - pump company has split up opinions in the online world with a commercial that compares mothers who feed on cows.
To mark a product launch that is said to show "stour pumps that can be used first in the world," Elvie's consumer technology company released an inspired commercial from video music videos to show the freedom that this pump is given to express a mother.
Four mothers dance in the barn with straws following a song that includes lyrics like this: "Yes, I'm reding on my own, but you don't see the tail" and "if you don't pay attention to it, it's not mentioned, it's my breast."
Continue with the reef: "Compa out, pump out, pump out, I feed them dear, pump out, pump out, pump out, I'm milking my woman."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of this company has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a variety of reactions from viewers, with many saying this makes "danging" in the milk industry.
"A very bad decision using a cow to advertise this product.
Just like us, the cow must also be pregnant and gave birth to milk, unless the baby was stolen from them in a few days after giving birth," wrote someone.
Elvie's breast pumps fit in the BH nursing (Evie/ Mother)
Another comment: "Frauma can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But yes, why not use it to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have to keep the baby?"
Another added: "A missing commercial."
The other guy defended the advertising, with a woman who admitted that she found the song "guku."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still feeding.
It makes me feel exactly like a cow.
It's a bit crazy but I accept it.
It's a product of genius," wrote someone.
Others observed: "This is a pleasant advertising that is intended for mothers who are extorting (in their place of work or toilet) and who feel like "sapi."
This isn't an ad of praise and justice of the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt they were dancing with hidden pumps that were lying in their bras.
The concept of this campaign came from the insights of many women who were extorting milking them saying they felt like a cow.
However, Elvie Pump was really quiet, without wire or tubes and peace in a nursing bra, which gave women freedom to move, carry their babies, and even go out while extorting.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in Mother comments: "Evie's pump is a decent export product launched by convincing and offensive.
Comparing the description between expressing women and cows we want to pump milk and all its challenges, and showing it through the comfort and fun ways of freeness that new pumps.
This isn't the first time Elvie pumps became the main news.
In the London show Farshion Week, a mother with two children appeared on a catwalk for Martha Jakubowski's designer using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Sons move quietly to the Tent in Texas border
The number of minors that have been arrested has increased even though the monthly border developers have not changed, some of the result of the hard statements and policy introduced by the Trump government that has challenged children with sponges.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are foreign immigrants without documents, and fear harm their own ability to stay in that country by step to save the children.
Risk's growing in June, when the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household have to hand over fingerprints, and the data will be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in Immigration and Beaka, testified before Congress that the agency has captured dozens of people who applied to sponsor children under abandoned age.
The agency then made sure that 70 percent of those who were arrested had no record of criminal records.
"At least 80 percent of the people who become sponsors or members of the sponsoring group are illegally in this country, and most of them are evil strangers.
Then we keep hunting those people, " says Mr. Albence.
To process children faster, officials introduce a new rule that requires some of them to be present in court within a month of arrest, not after 60 days, which would be the standard of the shelter.
Most of them perform through video conference calls, not directly, to ask for their legal status cases to immigration judges.
Those who don't feel worthy of getting help will be immediately deported.
The longer the children are arrested, they are likely to become more anxious or depressed, causing the rise in violence or escape efforts, the speech of shelter and system reports that have been received in the past few months.
The lawyers say that concern increases in a larger facility like Tornillo, whose signs are on a child struggling to ignore, because it's the size of the size.
They say that moving children to camp without providing enough time for them emotionally or saying good-bye to his friends can make a lot of traumatic trauma.
Syria said to the people who were in the U.S., and France and Turkey, to step back.
The U.S. General Assembly Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked the Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who was also a representative of the prime minister, said that foreign forces occupied Syria' land illegally, for reasons against terrorism, and "will be dealt with properly."
"They must return immediately and do not make any terms."
Moualem confirms that "war against terror is almost over done" in Syria, where over 310,000 people have been killed since 2011, with over millions of people running away from their homes.
He confirms that Damascus will continue to fight this sacred battle until we clean up all Syria regions of terror and "the destruction of the illegal foreign army."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially training and influenceing the Men of Kurdi and Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in the country that are destroyed by war.
As for the situation of the refugees, Moualem's proving that they'd better be back, and he blames "some western countries" because "the greatest fear of the refugees are pushing them away.
"We've asked international society and humanity organization to facilitate this return," he said.
"They facilitate what should be a full problem of humanity."
The European and U.S. Union warned that there would be no aid in reconstruction for Syria to be agreed to political agreements between Assad and opposition to end the war.
The U.S. diplomats said the latest deal between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in large castles the last Idlib has provided opportunities to continue political discussion.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevents the great attack of the Russian Syrian forces that support Russia in the province, where there are three million people who live.
But Moualem confirms that the deal has a "distinct time" and causes the military action to target the worshipers of the Front Nusra fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, which "will be taken away."
The UN messenger Staffan de Mistra was hoping to call the first new committee meeting of government and opposition members to make post-war statements for Syria and open the way to the general election.
Moualem has posted the following conditions of the Syrian government in the committee, confirming that panel work should be restricted "to review current chapters," and warns against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second care
According to the logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020 unless, for many liberal audiences hope, confessions and scandals end his depreciation in the early years.
No doubt, "The most dramatic depreciation ever" end!
Until now, no sign of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, the main figure of hours with CNN has increased more than twice as many as 1,05 million and MSNBC nearly doubled to 1,6 million.
Fox News has a 2.4 million main-hour audience, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Madow Show" has occupied the TV peak with as many as a million audience on the night of the main news.
"This is the spirit that makes people interested in something that they don't understand," said Neal Baer, host of ABC drama show "Designed Survivor," about the secretary of the secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior and author of "Just the Funny Parts," and some of the hard Truth in showing up to Hollywood Boys," Club, has another theory.
He remembered taking a taxi in Boston before the general election of 2016.
The driver said he'd give Trump his voice right.
Why? He asked.
"He said," 'cause he made me laugh," Miss Scovell told me.
There's a value of entertainment in a mess.
Of course, it's not the same as another TV event, the story that comes from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family can be reunited again and restore global economy.
Instead of that, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
Even so, not only is an informed citizen of Paul Manafort at six o'clock did you find yourself watching the panel of experts debate the use of the sources "back" Bob Woodward for the book called "Fear," wearing the camel's camel's skin jacket on Paul Manafort's "s thick shirt," The Washington Post" and the implications of the terrible description of the Trumpy Danielmys anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"The interest of the policy he made makes it just like a reality event that comforts you every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive chief of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of "Pawn Stars," about the performances and the Truemp's diary (s hostile to the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

He was unable to free himself, not with Kavanugh who was prepared to face the Senate Justice Committee and then the Supreme Court according to its balance.
"I remember when we had all these crazy shows that day and people said, "It was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleis told me.

A lot of money from outside is running off the competition for half-time votes in the White House
It's just that Pennsylvania 17 gets a flood of money, thanks to the resuscitation of the congression district that hired two fighters in the same chair.
The recently set Pittsburg District, requested Conor Lamb from Rep.
Lamb advanced against other resistance, Republic of Keith Rothfus, now representing the old Pennsylvania 12, which is associated with a new district of Pennsylvania 17.
These maps were re-set after the state of Pennsylvania in January decided that the late circuits did not make legal sides to the Republic's party.
The completion of a new district in Pennsylvania 17 has resulted in a major campaign fund between the financial side of the great party, Dmoccatic Campaig Congrission (DCC) and the National Village of Campaignion (NRCC).
The Lamb is getting known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in March special election that is common for the 18 Pennsylvania Congress District.
It has been occupied by the Republican officials over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have sent the Democrat party a little higher.
A.S. Excites El Salvador's punishment for cutting down China, and then back
diplomats made sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama have admitted Beijing, giving a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and ordered a hotel in Panama to send out the Trump Organization management team.
The Office of the Foreign Department decided to withdraw the head of the American diplomat mission of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the latest policy that no longer confesss Taiwan," Heather Nauer, department speaking, is posted in an early statement this month.
However, punishment was only considered about El Salvador, who had received help from about $140 million from America in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
A proposed punishment, which includes the denial of financial aid and a demanding visa restrictions, will harm the Central American country and increase unemployment and murder.
When internal meetings went on, U.S. officials and Central America delayed high - level conferences that focused on the safety and economic prosperity to follow the same meeting last year that was considered to be a step forward to preventing migration into the United States.
But in mid - September, high government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to continue, in order that it would effectively end the punishment for El Salvador.
The deputy President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech in that conference, currently scheduled for midway October, as an import signal the government did at the meeting, captured diplomats.
And the three American messengers returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without bringing a new punishment from Washington.
A publicman of the White House to Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of this indistinct state.
Their statements were strengthened by an outward analysis that was close to the government and also spoke about this indistinct situation.
Studi's Story
Another shocking story is a report of a special adviser Robert Mueller about the possibility of Mr. Trump's trial, which is now very important in public records.
Mr. Mueller also discussed his investigation whether the Trump campaign is pollution with Russia in attacking our general election.
When Congress moves, Mr. Trump will be questioned for himself, just as he is prepared to go again in front of the voters, and it may end up being a jury of his partners.
So there's still much to do, and I don't mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's government is out of existence or in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we've been fighting.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make coups against Hitler, if only West were to fight him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed, and missed opportunities to avoid those years of massacre that followed.
The beginning of history revolved around the point of such aberration, and the advance or delay of democracy was inevitable.
Now Americans face some point of this change.
What should we do if Trump fired the deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who was watching for Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been under pressure since this was reported that, last year, he suggested secretly filming the president and claim that he wasn't worthy of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times's account was not true.
"How do we respond if the new F.B.I. investigation of the Art Kavanugh is incomplete or fair - or if he's filed to the Supreme Court despite a severe accusation of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we gonna give a voice at part time for Congress that will call for Trump?
If we fail to pass the test, democracy will get worse in a long time.
But I believe we'll make it, because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew Czech who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that I once had in my large embassy.
He survived, and then migrated to America and, in the next 60 years, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on the table that had been written by magic.
By leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope about our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans feel optimistic about the game facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers brought you Rapid Vienna on Thursday, the victory on Austria, following the good results of the Spanish mine against the early Villarreals of this month, will strengthen their position to escape from the European League Group.
The knee collar made Graham Dorrans' mid-serving can't perform in this first season until the result of 2-2 against Villarreals, but he's sure he can use the Rangers as a pijacing rock to greater despair.
"It's very good for us because Villarreal is a great team," the 31-year-old player's speech.
"In this game we're sure we can get something and go by watching one point.
In the end, we may be able to do it, but, according to us, it may be a fair result.
In the first half, they may perform better but in the second half, we get up and become a better team.
On Thursday, tonight became another great European day.
We're hoping to watch three points even if it's gonna be a tough match because they've got a good outcome in their last game, but, with the advance support behind us, I'm sure we can keep going forward and get a positive result.
In the past year, we had a hard time, because what happened because of my injuries and changes in the club itself, but right now there's a very good hope in this club.
This squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's good training.
May we now grow, put our past behind us and achieve success."

Although it turns out that surveyers have a clear idea of how they want to be treated, there's just not a lot of people who talk to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study discuss long - term care costs with their mate.
Only 10 percent of them say they're talking about this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no move to start the discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nation's life insurance business.
This is where it's time to start.
Start talking to your couples and children: You won't be able to prepare your own family to provide treatment if you don't tell your wishes first.
Be with the counselors and your family, where and how you get care, because what you choose will mean it is very important to determine the cost.
Include your financial advisers: Your counsel can certainly help you in showing how to pay the bills.
The request you choose for long - term treatment includes the traditional long - term insurance policy, the hybrid insurance policy that guarantees these costs or provides for yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal document: confronting the fight of the legal debate.
Show immediately the power to your health care, which is someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee that if you wish to be performed by professional people when you can't communicate.
On the other hand, the letter of power in your financial affairs should also be considered.
Someone who trusts to take care of all your financial decisions must be chosen, except to make sure your bill payments are not possible.
Always remember any small details: Try to imagine when your aged parents are in emergency health and on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer questions about medicine or allergies?
Turn that sort of detail so you're ready to answer.

The federal prosecutor's working on a death sentence that rarely happens to suspect a terror attack in NYC
The federal prosecutor in New York sought death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspect in a terror attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- the punishment was rare and had never been done in state related to federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was expected to strike by hitting a truck that he hired from Home Depot to pedestrians and bikes across the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death sentence, the prosecutors had to give proof that Saipov killed these eight victims deliberately and "promissiblely" and caused serious injury, based on a statement of the will to punish the death penalty of the South New York District.
Based on the court documents, the two charges enable to be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury accused Saipov with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in the campaign, where federal prosecutors are usually used in organized crimes, as well as violent acts and acts of violent vehicle destruction.
According to the prosecutor, the attack requires "prestanceal planning and early maturity," as a description of the Saipov crimes committed by "guy, cruel, and rude."
It was shown in a statement of will, "Sayullo Habbillaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss of family and friends from Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren, Ariel Erduser, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damigcco."
Five victims at the incident are Argentina's native tourists.
It's been estimated a decade since the South New York District had dropped a last sentence.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of murder of two drug masks, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last death sentence was last held in New York federal court in 1953, dropped on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple of wives who were convicted in the conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple were executed dead with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Based on the trial document, Sipov, the origin of Uzbekistan, shows no remorse as long as it goes by day and month after the attack.
When asked by investigators, he said that he was happy about what he had done, arresting the police.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that the attack he did was inspired by the ISIS videos that were monitored from his phone, as was the charge.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be put in his hospital room, saying the police.
He expressed no guilt for 22 charges that he had been sentenced to.
David Patton, one of the federal public attorneys who represents Saipov, says "by being clearly disappointed" against the prosecutor's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to execute death is to accept the penalty for a lifetime prison sentence without a release will only prolong the trauma of the people involved in the incident," noted Patton.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had appealed to the prosecutor not to put a death sentence.
NIGEL FRAGE is responsible for Brexit negotiation, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage is calling for the 'moving of the people' today in protests at Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians have to taste his heat' Eurosceptics -- because one of the first member of the parliament, Theresa May, suggested that politicians join in negotiation with the EU.
A conservative group champion, Peter Bone, said to the street action in Birmingham that the English should come out right now if Farage is to be Secretary Brexit.
Still, the challenge that May faced in divided religious reconciliation has been ruled by the support of the Tories Remain who joined in separate protests Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fought to defend his Chequers' compromise plan to stay in his path even in the middle of Brexiteers' attack, Remainers and the European Union.
Human states emphasize that he will be moved to reach a deal with Brussels, even if he gets a bad reaction -- and force Eurosplastics and Bur must determine the choice between the package and the 'disposing'.
Bone told the mob of Leave Means Leave at Solihull that he wanted to 'posing Chequers.
His use, that Farage should point to a partner to be given responsibility in negotiation with Brussels.
"If the responsibility stays with him, we'll be out now," he says.
Parties of the Wellingborough resort added: "I'm ready to stand up to Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
All of a sudden, as well as showing the opposition to the European Union: "We don't fight in the world's war to be in subjection.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.'
Bone pull over the proposal that public opinion potentially led to changes since the vote of 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed and wanted fixed conditions, that's absolutely not true."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who also joined in that mass action, posted to journalist: 'Serhana, I just want to say: "O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers aren't popular among the public, but the opposition won't choose it, because it's not popular with our party and our activists who actually went down to the street and took us first position.
Our request, get rid of Chequers and start listening to us.'
By means of a message that was directed to May, it added: "The Minister's fund defends their work when they are promised."
Farage said that a politician's demonstration had to be released so that he could feel the heat' if they wanted to break the reserendum decision in 2016.
‘ The most precious time was trust between us and our political parties,’ he said.
'They're trying to break Brexit and here we are today, confirming that 'We're not going to make you escape to do that.'
He added in a message to a enthusiastic public crowd: 'I want you to make our political parties, who are prepared to break Brexit, also feel the heat.
“We are moving the people of this country to win us over in Brexit and will never give up until it has come to us by myself, its own ruler, and their pride.'
In the meantime, the Remainers are moving through Birmingham before taking action downtown for two hours.
The act of activists seemed to spread Tories Against Brexit after setting up his line on this weekend.
A partner in the Busk, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservative group regarding the safety issue of their party application when the conference was opened.
"These are the ones who tell us that they can rule the TT system and all technology for Canada, whatever, for the anti-gesc border, in an infinite free trade order in Ireland,' his senses.
‘ Truly a joke show.
There's no good Brexit at all,' the dive.

President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on a Saturday break through his village, and he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford on the sexual disconding of the Supreme Judge Kret Kavanugh
Speaking in a reli in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement presented by Ford in front of the Senate Court of Justice, rather than comment on what is going on in the Senate that shows people who are "bad and unfair."

"When you look at the Olympics and leak and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
All right, wait a minute.
Are we leaking... no, we don't leak it," in addition, as a senator's empressor.

He made a great line for the jury as to how he used cell phone recordings to gather various movements the defendant at 29th year of Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received data from several mobile phones showing Tellis on one location with Chambers on the night of his death, instead of the previous defendant's statement, reported Clarion Ledger.
When the data shows the defendant's cell phone was at one location with Chambers during that time, he was arguing that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, finally asking for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he wasn't in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis said it was true when he said that he was in the Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "bok, because my truck was in Nashville."

Another black guy?
The NY need a couple for attack after taking out the "saalis" message.
A New York nanny demands a couple for having attacked him in an instant after receiving an incompetent message from a mother who said that she was "other black."
The couple refused that they were considered racial, and they assumed it was more like "servation."
Lynsey Plastco-Faxman, the mother of two children, showed her anxiety when she realized that a new child - care worker, Giselle Maurice, was black when she was in her first day at 2016.
"DAUDA QUEN'T PEOPLE OF THE PEOPLE," wrote Mrs. Plaxman-Faxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
Having realized his mistake, "bad" Plaxman fired Miss Maurice, claimed that they had released a nanny, who was an African-American citizen, because he had done an ugly job and he was more expecting the Philippines people, according to New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then returned with Uber.
At this point, Maurice is demanding that the couple be compensated for the recovery, and asking for an additional $350 a day for six months, in exchange for a nanny's job to do, even if there's no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that," he said to Post on Sunday, adding "I know it's an discrimination."
The couple fight claims that they're racialists, claiming that Maurice's job is a reason to do, they're afraid they can't believe it after he spoke,
"My wife has sent something she doesn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racial,' Joel Plasco's husband said to the Post.
"But can you let your children be treated by someone you've abused, though it's only a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
It's like "specting," says Plasco's wife had two months to give birth to her baby and was in "the most difficult situation."
"You're going after someone who's in that condition?
That's not a good thing to do, "the investment banker added.
When legal cases are still running, public opinion has made quick warnings against the couple in social media, blaming for their attitude and logic.
He's not gonna be in touch with a bear, a new newspaper revealed.
Her daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born not far after the book was accepted, explained in the letter. "It was difficult to just speak without knowing the position she had encountered, reading it first before it was published.
Very funny knowing what we know about the great success of Paddington."
Says his father, who was BBC cameraman before inspiring through a child's book with a bear toy, which was highly optimistic about the work that had been rejected, he added to the 60th year of the book's "Fine" publication after his father's death last year.
To Paddington, which he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father pretty proud of the end of his success.
"He's a quiet man, and he's not an arrogant man," he said.
"But because Paddington meant a great deal to him, it's like you have a son who's got something: you're proud of them even though not your whole business.
I think he looked at Paddington's success like that.
Even though it is the result of his imagination, he will always praise Padington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say good-bye to her through the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter was soon taken to Nice Passeur's hospital, but the doctors failed to save her.
"Nad did a quiet call to deliver it was really bad that he was probably not gonna survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that declared he would die in two minutes ahead and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did it too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors have given him to keep his heart running slowly and to leave his system behind.
He's been dead for a while when the process of treatment took place and everything felt deadly.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't scream or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving for the loss of her daughter, riding on a plane with another passenger -- unaware of what she's going through.
"No one knows," he said.
"My chest is stiffed and my tears keep testing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when on that flight I felt so deeply sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
The grieving women posted cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones trying to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiration messages and numbers that can be contacted for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said that his son was a cook who promised with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They used to say that his smile made the atmosphere."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother Tyler was the one who found his brother after he killed himself.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried if there will be any further effects."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can approach and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and keep quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his mate for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed there was a change in his behavior.
He was at the lowest point when Christmas Day-- when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to go through it: "It makes the abyss in the family.
It's separating us.
But we have to get through it and fight."

Bret Kavanaugh's future is in uncertainty when the FBI started its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking -- an investigation that is limited to time, restricted to his range-- we might be able to bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the "blank" committee in the middle of the council.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and support the Republic doesn't want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance was all due to time.
The legislational system is five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republican does it badly, they'll be very weak on the opportunity to make the one whom they want selected in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, blobi them to support Mr. Kavanough, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him meeting Ashley his wife, who is the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI made her report?
There will be an election at the Senate, where 51 Republican and 49 Democrats sit.
It's still not clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 voices between the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide the winner and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean Slobs under Kim
The number of men that have rebelled from North Korea to South Korea has been greatly reduced since Kim Jong-un-one in power seven years ago, said a member of Korea's union committee.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from South entration data, said that there was 1,127 chance last year-- compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said border control between North Korea and Chinese and higher rate rates taken by people's smugglers is the key factor.
Pyong who doesn't give a public comment.
Most of the North were eventually granted South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul said over 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have escaped through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Dianlitization Zone between the two Koreans.
Chinese treated the offenders as illegally illegal than refugees and often forced them to return.
The relationship between the North and the South is still technically in the war - has been greatly increased in the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the second state leaders met in Pyongyang for the conversation that focused on the delayed offender - protection negotiation.
This occurred after a historic meeting in June between the president of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a wide sense to cooperate with the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed the U.S. bill for the lack of progress ever since.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, there will be no way that we will drop our weapons in the side," said Mr. Ri in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Bret Kavanaugh "hggys," said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The chairman of the Oppositor Nancy Pelosi accused the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanagh "hggiss" and said he's not quite well suited to serve in the Supreme Court.
The philosophy made that comment in a Saturday interview in Texas Trolle Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid thinking that if a woman looks like that, they'll say "hysterics'," Pelosi said about her response to the Kavanugh's test in front of the Yudisal Council Commission on Thursday.
The Kavanaugh emotionally argued that he had been sexually abused on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, a couple of times screaming and having trouble talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also deliberately condemned Democrat in the committee, saying that the charges against him were "unsensive, irritinized character murder" organized by the liberals who were upset because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Plosi said he believed testimoni Kavanaugh proved that he couldn't serve in the Supreme Court because he was bitter against Democrat.
"I think he's qualified himself with these statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democrat," he said.
Plocision claims that if he's gonna try to claim if he's approved, and if Democrat gets more voices at the People's Office.
"I would say like this -- if he didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he wouldn't be suitable not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court now," said Plosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at D.C. High Court.
The philosophy added that he was a Democrat he was concerned about the potential of Kavanough's breakup against the School of Health or Roe v. Wade, because he was seen as a member of a conservative justice.
In the office hearing, Kavanaugh avoids the question of whether he's going to break certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone who's hysterics and bis to come to court and expect us to say, "It's not great,' said Pelosi.
And women need to deal with it.
It's a very ethical self, anger for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
He went on, "I was very helpful by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person who was talking to her, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then he goes on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The tears were removed as a way out of anger part because they were basically misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early jobs, in a man's office, one day I cried with an unexplained anger, was my affair surrounded by an older woman - a cold manager who was always a little scared of me into the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they made it."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the president's election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a affair outside of marriage on a boat named Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Miss Schroeder, understood that there was no reason for himself to be president.
"It wasn't a thought-of-fit decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There's been seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone calls it "Brill and Seven Kurcaciss."
Since it's too late in the campaign, he's left behind in fundraision, and so he swore he wouldn't follow the election unless he managed to collect $2 million dollars.
It was a fight that led to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters gave $10,000 to a man only gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
When he was a speecher announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was too deeply controlled by emotions - thanks to those who supported him, frustrated by the system that made money so difficult and to target votes from delegates, and anger against sexualism - making it difficult to talk.

How U.S. trading competition might be good for Beijing
The opening shooting of the trade competition between the U.S. and China is so powerful, and when the fight is still far from the use of the word, the interrathing between two countries may be of benefit to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning this year by taxing the Chinese key exports including the solar panel, steel and aluminum.
A very significant treatment was done starting this week with new fares that affected $1,200 billion ($2 billion), effectively taxing half of all things that went through the US through China.
Beijing's been back every time, recently doing five to ten percent in American goods worth $60 billion.
Chinese has been begging to call the U.S. one-per-one, and the second largest economy in the world won't change in the near time.
Telling Washington to step back means to follow the will, but public surrender to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, Chinese president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play his card correctly, the pressure of U.S. trade competition can support China in a long term by reducing both economic dependencies.
"Fakta that the quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can create conditions that trigger economic movement in both countries is actually more dangerous than what has previously been observed," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert institution.

Six million other people who still live in the country need human help.
Al-Moualem says the Syrian regime will receive help to rebuild the devastated state.
But he emphasized that they won't receive any conditional aid or aid from countries supporting rebellion.
