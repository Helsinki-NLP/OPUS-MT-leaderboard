Is there any symptoms or other problems that you've noticed together with muscle pain?
Is there anyone else who is sick like you at home with the same symptoms?
Do you feel any other symptoms?
Have you ever felt sophyximed?
Do you still feel chest pain?
'Cause it's a flu season.
But we can't remove the chest pain that comes from the heart either.
But more important problems now are this chest pain
And I'm having trouble breathing
But I know a lot of coughs towards me
But we need to handle every chest pain very seriously
But now you can breathe well?
I totally forgot the cause of this chest pain

Did you see the picture?
Drink plenty of fluids today
But I had diabetes tests.
But he had a rather similar symptoms with me
How high is your fever?
How's your blood pressure?
if your fever continues

I'm also a little fever.
I had a fever yesterday.
I feel pain stabbed here in the chest
I also had trouble breathing
I'll send a picture to you
I feel chest pain today
I just feel a little headache and fever today
According to my opinion, it's a flu
In my opinion, it's a little flu
Does it feel like there's someone really heavy sitting on your chest?
It all started with fever at almost the same time.
It hurts in the middle of my chest
pressure like chest pain
on my chest

The immusis of the coronary disease (COVID19) that grew rapidly in the European Union/Wilaomy Economic Europe and Britain, January 1 through March 15, 2020
The analysis of the cases of the coronary disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/Wilaomy Economic Europe and Britain confirming that, although it's different levels depending on countries, the COVIDian Institute developed very quickly in all countries.
According to Italian experiences, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase the preparation of the COVID patient who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, claims of pneumon case with unrecognology were reported in Wubi Province Hubei, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Control Center and Prevention reports this disease's a new coronary agent called the crownvirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronary disease (COVID-19).
Evidence until now indicates that about 80% of COVID class suffer from mild disease, which is the respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these sufferers healed.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 developed into a heavier disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of the other cases are suffering from critical illnesses that require intensive care.
The patients who were treated at the hospital because of COVID-19, about 4%.
In this study, we studied the trends of the COVID 19-century Union/Wilayah Economic European (EU/EEEEA) and Britain (UBL) and compared with an incident in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the number of today COVID-19 cases in the EU/EA country and the U.S.A. with the number of cases in Italy for January 31 –15 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EA and U.S.A.
After China, the COVID-19 experienced a further geography and redemployed COVID panmed in other parts of the world today, following a symmika pandemia in China.
On March 11, 2020, the director of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-important.
In Eurosurveillance 2020 of March 5, Spiti et al. Reporting the first European case with the COVID-19 confirmed by the definition of WHO case.
In EU/EA, three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 on people returning from WUU, Hubei Province, China.
On March 15, 2020, the COVID-19 case was detected in all 30 countries EU/EEA and Britain (U.S.), between December 31, 2019 and March 1520 on that date, there are 398 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17.50 cases of Italy alone.
Getting a personality number and a gradual incident of COVID-19.
In the European Center and Disease Control, the number of CLOVID cases that tell every country around the world is updated every day at 8.00. It is obtained only from the official source of health, national health and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess the LOVID-19 trend in EU/EEA and CHUA, and compare it with trends in Italy.
As a prevalence of the COVID-19 active case, we're counting a 14-day- Of-year-old LOVID incident, so consider the COVID-19 natural journey, in every EU/EA and English state, in the January 1 period of January–15 2020.
We also present the personalityal number of cases known to every country until March 1520 at 8.00 compared with the Italian case during January 31th –15Maret 2020.
Tren COVID-19 in EU/EA and UU
The KIVID-importal incident took place 14 days in EU/EEA and generally followed the trend in the Hubei Province (GImbar 1).
For EU/EEA and the overall, the COVID-19al incident began to rise about 21 February, and then it grew sharp about February 28th 2020.
This train is especially moved by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all of the other EU/EA countries and the British show the increase in the growth of similar COVID-imal incidents.
Picture 2 shows the calibility of the COVID-19 case in EU/EA and CURB compared with the milligramative number in Italy during January 31 – March 15, 2020.
The data highlights that, until March 15 p.m., 15 other EU/EA countries and the U.S.A. have reported a total number of cases worth the total number of Italian cases earlier or less than that.
Our results indicate that the amount of LOVID-19 cases which is said to increase rapidly in EU/EA and UU.
A common sight in the COVID-imulation incident suggests that pandemia increases at equal speed in all countries.
It's regardless of the differences of the extent to which countries, differences of public health response, and possible differences between state definitions and protocols to choose patients who have to be tested for the COVID-19 confirmation, which includes milk testing.
At the beginning of March 20,20, doctors in the divided Italian region explained the situation about 10% of COVID patients in the world needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in this region have reached its maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 cases data in hospital and/or intensive care units at EU/EA level are only available for each 6% and 1% cases (not shown).
But the data must be collected in a systematic way to complete the current survey data that is focused on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study done in 2010 20201 shows a great variation in the supply of intensive care and medical treatment in Europe, about from 29,2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more resources or less than Italy (the bed of intensive care and medical care per 100,000 populations in 2010 20201).
EU/EEA and U.S. risk rates are related to health care skills, with the prediscision of the CDDC cases of rapid risk for every state of EU/EEA and U.E. which is related to risk >90% beyond the capacity of intensive care, provided in the sixth-procretion rate of LDCOD.
Because the most widely known cases in the EU/EA and U.S. countries, and the hospital and intensive care units usually serve the population of special regional services, information about cases and intensive care facilities should be provided at the level of the district Unit for Statistics 2 (U.S.2).
The experience of Italy and the current trend in other countries suggests that COVID-EEEA and CU.
Therefore, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit should prepare for the scenario of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission and raise the number of patients who need health care, especially intensive care, as it did in Italy.
As shown in quick ecDC risk assessments, a quick approach, professional, and comprehensive approach is vital to slow down the SARS-CoV-2, with a distraction approach to my approach, because the increase in cases is rapid, as it is anticipated, may not allowing enough time to make decisions and hospitals to understand, and adapt the correct response if it does not apply.
Those quick risk evaluations also listed the health steps of society's health to assess the impact of the academy.
The shortest window of opportunities when the country has had a chance to improve its exercise efforts at slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 spread and reduce the pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EA health system is likely to face a patient's attention that needs intensive care in a few days or weeks to come forward.
The plague of the crownvirus 2019 (COVID-19), which was caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), so far has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, which has caused disaster for mankind.
Similar to the homologic virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be tested from bats and caused similar symptoms through the similar mechanism.
Even so, COVID has a lower level of severity and mortality than SARS, but more infectious and more about older than young people, and more in men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications about this new disease, this article is trying to provide a rapidly growing survey of the subject of study.
We're going to discuss the basics of epidemiology, etheology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this survey helps understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Summer Festival on January 25, 2020 has been a memory that has never happened and forgotten for all Chinese people who were told to stay at home during vacation and a few weeks after the outbreak of a new virus.
This virus is very homologous with World Health Organization on February 11, 2020, and disease caused by its expression is called CV.D. (C.E.) (C.E.).
Anemia started at Wiba, China, and quickly spread across the country and to almost 50 other countries around the world.
Until March 2, 2020, this virus has led to 80,000 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, with over 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died of the world.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "precident enemy number 1" and is potentially damaging more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (htps://www.c.nlll.nl.n.h.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 2020, which sets out viral dryerizations from some patients, more than 200 so have been published about COVID-firology, analy, analy, analytic, anasis, and his treatment.
This review is trying to work on the progress of research in this rapidly growing new subject field.
As possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with the SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak of 2012).
We will also discuss things that have been learned so far about prevention and prognosis of disease and some other questions that have not yet been answered, but they are urgent.
According to tradition, CV is considered a nontletal pathogen for humans, especially causing about 15% pills 4.
Even so, in this century, we have found a CV very pathogen for human beings twice, which is SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of which led to an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with a terrible mortar and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is today the third CV plague in recorded human history.
As shown at Gbr.1, a pneumonia called the first incident of the Wurt on December 31, 2019 to the National Public Health Commission of the Chinese Republic.
Seven days later, CV decredents launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wabs was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly into cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, health - care infections reported, signaling that human transmissions may occur.
On January 23, the region's quarantine was performed in the city of Wabur and the entire public transport was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of this disease reported that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients were directly exposed to Whista’s food market, which was considered to be the first location of infection from an unknown animal source.
In January 30, WHO declared this plague a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, this disease had spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).2).
Because the situation is developing very quickly, the endline and the severity of the outbreak must still be set.
On February 11, 2020, multiplused study at 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 patients confirmed, providing the following more renewable description of the epidemic (htps://mp.weixin.q.com/UlBi-HX_HPXHAqdahdahd).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Nearly half (47, 17) of those infected over 50 years old, only a few under 20 years of age, and only 14 are infected by the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 more infect men (0,31/100,000) than women (0,27/100,000).
COVID-19 spreads in cherster, especially inside and around Hubei.
THE COVID-19 takes an average of 5-9) days from awitan to diagnosis.
The average incule period is 4.8 (3,0-7,2) day.
The average time starts from awitan to death is 9.5 (48-13) days.
Base reproductive numbers (R0) are 3,77 (95% CI: 3,51-405) and R0 is combined 2.23-482222.
The number of infected people increased exponently before 23 Jan. 2020, according to the time of travel before the Summer Festival in China.
The patient'sqtality with a case confirmed by 1,44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%) and fatality is reduced to all patients by 3.6% (95% CI: 2,02-485.
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 are sex, age (60 years), and pneumonia is heavy.
CV is a large subcontained virus subcontaining that contains a single tape of RNA sense.
CV can be divided into four genuss, as well as alfa, beta, and delta, with alfa- and coV are known to infect humans.
Glicoprotein tonjolan or cheating (S) the cover compared with the cell reception, enzymes for the 17th 2 (ACE 2) and aptididil peptide 4 (DP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then the membrane line occurs.
Genom RNA virus is released into the sytopplasm; after the circulation of the virus, geneiam was accompanied by glycoprotein cover and kleokasiid protein formed vesicleel containing virion, which then experienced with plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first series of SARS-CoV-2 genes reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-CoV type with more than 99.98% of 10 samples at risk; that sample was taken from the location of the plague, which is the Johnan Sea Food market in Wan.
Geneticly, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than with MERS-CoV.
Through the electron electron transmission, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the very thin part of the human breathing system.
ACE2 men were found to be a prescription for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Even so, SARS-CoV-2 proteins link humans with ACE2 are weaker than their ties to SARS-CoV protein, which is according to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes an infection that is not as strong as SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein that is combined with orf3b and protein contained with an orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may have a role in virus pathogen and iFN's expression inhibit; however, orf8 doesn't have any functional domain or a familiar motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported cryo-EM ACE2 human structure on a 2.9 increase in complex with amino B0AT1 acid transport.
They found that complex, which has an open and closed harmony, is set up atmer and complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two proteins S, which is evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be a permanent target in drug filtering to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
It's the original and the medium pool.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each of them has been subjected to man by bosang and camel.
By comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CVs, bats are considered to be the original SARS-CoV-2 in view of this new virus is 96% identical to two similar CoV-SARS of bats called bat-SL-CoVXX45 and bat-SL-CoVXX21.
However, the media park that helps the virus cross the species’s barrier to infecting humans is still unknown, and transmission routes must still be explained.
Ji, et al. proposes snakes as bear viruses from bats to humans that involve homolog recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researcher in kak, China, proposes that the milling bird, the long ant-meat mammal that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine, potentially as an inner SARS-CoV-2's effect on the excess of the genetic coV found in the mill and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the differences that spread throughout the region are still a big difference; therefore, a concrete result is yet to be found (Gbr. 3).
SARS-CoV-2 physics is largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days on 20 °C and 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar qualities.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; etanol 75%, snextricants containing chlorines, modate acids, chloroforms, and other fats, but not chorexins, effectively disable the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immune to SARS-CoV-2 and because it's vulnerable to this new virus.
Right now, there's not been a detailed study reporting an immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another CoV study before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr.4).
In general, after unsuscitating, the virus is known by the default immun system through pattern remitor (PRR), which includes C-type stickin-like receivers, Toll-like receivers (TLR), NOD-like receivers (NLRR), and RIG-IG-Illep (RCR).
Through different paths, the virus induces the expression of the Inflematry factor, dendritic cell mature, and synthesis interferon I (IFN) which restricts the spread of virus and speeds anti-egotorostosis by mauphag.
However, protein N on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune reactions.
Before long, the immune response was adaptive in fighting against this virus.
Limfosit T, which includes CD4+ cells and CD8+, plays an important role in this defense.
T CD4+ cells resuscitating B cells to produce specific antibodis against viruses, and T CD8+ cells kill cells that are infected directly.
The T T T cells produce stokin proflemagram to help protect the cell.
Nevertheless, CV can interfere with T cells by stimulating T cell apotosis.
A sense of humor, which includes completions, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodi is also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, an isolated antibodi of a patient who has been hospitalized neutrally MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reaction results in a large number of locally free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, at the worst scenario, failure of makeup and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 Infection, which is marked with awitan class, more about older than the disease and pregnant women.
Mostly, people who are exposed to the virus in large numbers or whose immune functions are disturbed have a chance of infection higher than anyone else.
The basic SARS-CoV-2 period is 1-14 days, most of 3-7 days based on the study of 425 first cases in Writ.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the average period of inquisitivity is 3 days and is about from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as explained above, show that the period of immunciation 4.8 (3,0-7,2) days based on demography 8.866 cases.
It is vital that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate periods of inquivalry so as to prevent the infected, but without symptoms, infecting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to virus or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should we allow quarantine to last up to 24 days?
Demams are often major and early symptoms of COVID, with or without any other symptoms like dry coughs, coldness of breath, muscle pain, headaches, throat pain, breast pain, severe chest pain, diure, diusea, and vomit.
Some patients have been suspended and/orpoxemia a week after the awitan disease.
In a severe case, the development of patient disease is fast going to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic assis, and coagulopathy.
The patient who suffers from fever and/or symptoms of respiratory fever and acute fever, even though without lung disease, has to be sued to the virus for early diagnosis.
The demography at the end of December 2019 suggests that the percentage of symptoms by 98% for fever, 76% for dry coughs, 55% for depression, and 3% for dire; 8% of patients needed a vatilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, which was study on family and class labels that were based on the transmission of amustomatic people.
A demography study in 2012 shows that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and disa (55%) as a major symptom.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with more dynamicness than ERS than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and throat pain (21%) is also observed on MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry rock%-75%), disa (40%-42%), dire (20-25%), and throat pain (13-25%) is shown as the main symptoms and support of ventilation is needed for about 14% per cent of patients.
Until February 14th, the CVID mortality is 2% by confirmed case reached 66.576 worldwide.
As far as that is, the SARS mortality in November 2002 is 10% of 8.096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, based on demography studies on June 2012, death to 37% of 2.494 confirmed cases.
The previous rate reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached the height of 6,47 with a total of 5,71-73, while R0 SARS-CoV is only 2 to 4.
The SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given at Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has higher spread skills than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it's not as likely as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemir is greater than the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV bread.
Most scenes are often found in one family or from a group or a vehicle like a cruise ship.
The patient often has a travel history or lives in the Statis or another peaceable area or contact with an infected person or a patient within the last two weeks before the awitan.
However, it is reported that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms of more than two weeks and patients who have been sent from a hospital can bring the virus again, thus causing caution to increase quarantine.
At the beginning, patients have an estimated number of normal cyphytes white blood cells or low.
For example, limfopeia by counting white blood cells <4299/L, which includes counting siphocytes < 1299/L, and Amino amino transferment and increased viremia patients found at 1.099 C.VID.
The enzymes of heart and muscle and mioglobin increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and the rate of blood emissions increases in most patients.
In a patient with a heavy case, the D-dimer's rate is increasing, that is, the product of fibrin's processing in the blood, and the count of limfocites is down more progressive.
The form of photo totras was found in large groups of COVID patients was known for their lyrical shadows or ground-glassities in the lungs.
Patients often have a pneumony pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory disease (ARDS).
When ARDS occurred, inflamation of integeration, I am musculating fluid, and progressive physics is very much agrescienting gas exchange.
The function of pneumocy type I and type II lowers the level of southernfakt and increases surface pressure so that it lowers lung capacity to expand and increase the risk of lungs.
As a result, the worst discovery on the sex photo is often parallel with the worst level of disease.
On February 18, 2020, first-century pathology analysis indicated the loss of pneumocytes, forming a hyalin membrane, and infiltration of interstitial vertiate cells, as well as much synthenic cells in the lungs of patients who died of this disease, in line with viral pathology and ARDS and similar to patients ’ pathology and MERS.
The RARS-CoV-2 Detect is used as the main criteria for COVID-disciptation diagnosis.
But because the high level of false negative, which can speed up the epidemic, hyphistication began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer only depends on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
Similar situations also occurred at SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination between the history of disease, clinicals, lab tests, and radiological findings is vital and a need to create effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Fed's group explained the use of SHERLOCCCK techniques based-CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects RARS-CoV-2 fragments on 20 × 10-18 ml-L-18 ml-L-100 copies of micro-L-L-L-L-L-L-ciput cells inciput in), using the cell lines in less than an hour without a complicated attempt.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly enhance sensitivity and ease if it is verified on clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with new CVs, doctors especially offer support to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or previously for other CoV care, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral disease.2.
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with anticompression, immunospression, steroids, plasma from a patient who is cured, Chinese Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of a patient who has already recovered was proposed to be used in therapy.
Pharmation companies have developed antibodi and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 is especially attacking the lungs and may also attack other organs that express the ACE2 in lower levels, such as a gasthretinol and kidney system.
However, success and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is vital to ease symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high - flow oxygen, non-dance ventilation, and mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of disease.
The patient with heavy respiratory symptoms must be supported by extracorporeum oxygen (ECMO), which is the modified dipulmoner’s method of treating heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolit balance, preventing and treatment of secondary infections and septics, and vital organ function protection is also vital for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
An excessive immune system reaction is known to cause stokin storms on SARS patients and MERS patients.
A cytokin storm is a form of systemic immune response that marks a series of silencies, including TNFkins, Ll-1 works, Ll-2, IFN-6, IFNFN's IFNFN's deg, IFN's focused, and MCP-1.
These skin-siltkins are parading an immune cell to release a large amount of free radical that is the main cause of ARDS and failure of the perjemuk organ.
Immunospression is very important in handling a stokin storm, especially in severe patients.
The Komicsteroids and Tociizumab, an anti-Il66 anti-Il6 anti-craignional anti-Indes, have been used to handle the stokin storm.
Other immunosuppressors for sitokin storm include imun response modules directed by T cells; IFN- also LO-1, and TNF; inhibisi JK; blinatomomab signal signal; and HDOC inhibi.
Steroids, as immunosgupression, are used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflamatory damage.
However, femaleoids on high doses are useless for heavy lung injury to SARS patients and COVID-19.
On the other hand, steroids can result in severe side effects, especially oxyonecrosis, which has a powerful effect on prognosis.
Even so, the short molecular gift on a low dose of doses is being encouraged to give careful care to critical COVID patients.
At the time of this review, there was not yet effective insulin therapy confirmed.
However, intravencia's brake gift, a nephoticide disorder, was found to be honored by an American COVIDian patient.
Redesivir is a new antidesviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of disease caused by Era and Marlburg virus.
Later, the brakes led to another single untai virus, which includes MERS and SARS virus.
According to this, Gilead provides this compound for China to do a series of trials in the SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the results are very eager.
In addition, caratcitinb, interferon- havenavir, will haveinavir/ritornavir, and it has been suggested as a potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diare, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side reaction can occur after combination therapy with loinavir/rirnavir.
This illustration of therapy with other drugs that patients use must be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recoverable patients and antibody creation
There is a long history of the gathering of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy people from developing the disease.
True, cured patients often have relatively high antibodi levels in their blood.
Antibodi is immunoglulin (Ig) which produces limphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from the LOVID-19 and suggested to 10 severely ill patients.
Their symptoms have improved in 24 hours, along with a drop of inflamation and virus burden and increased oxygen unit in the blood.
However, proofs and clarifications need to be done to perform the method for a large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
In addition to the therapeutic effects, some ones related to plasma must be considered carefully.
For example, antibodi can exploit the immune response excessively and cause stokin's syndrome, which is a potentially life - threatening behavior.
Antibodi concentration is usually low and plasma is required in large numbers to care for critical patients.
The development and production of specific antibodis are fast enough to fight the global epidemic is hard to do.
Therefore, more important and more practically isolate B cells from already healed patients and identify the genetic code that is effective in antibodi or in an effective antibodi filtering of antibodis that is effective for proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of components in formulas, and these formulas are different to depend on disease diagnosis based on TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or obscured because it is hard to extract or verify those components or their optiminary combination.
Right now, because effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 has not yet existed, TCM has become one of the primary alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms until now or for those who recover from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Huaman Wen were well - known for COVID-19 therapy.
The top recovery rate in COVID-19 patient therapy is observed in some Chinese provinces that use TCM on 85, including Gansu (63, Cambodia), NUxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei province, which uses only about 30% COVILM patients, has a low level of cure (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other effects, such as the number and severity of patients, have to be included in evaluation.
On February 18th 2020, Boli Arnold and the friends made a study that compared West drug therapy (WM) alone with WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time it took to recover the body temperature, the loss of symptoms, and the inapprop is so much shorter in the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone.
More impressively, the rate of hunting symptoms (from light to weight) is much less for WM+TCM groups than the WM group alone (7.4% above 46.2%) and more mortality in the WM+TM group than the WM group only (8,8% over 3 million.
Even so, effective and security of TCM are still waiting for tested tests that are more controlled on a larger scale and in more research centers.
The other interesting thing is to characterize the working mechanism and clarify effective components in TCM therapy or combination, if possible.
Most patients expected or confirmed COVID-19 have been greatly afraid of these highly contagious and even deadly diseases, and the people who were quarantined are also exposed to discouragement, loneliness, and anger.
Moreover, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and side effects as well as insomia caused by cornosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
In the early phase of the SARS plague, a series of psychic morbiditys, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychocomputers, psychobistic symptoms, dicirium, and even suicides have been reported.
Intributing contact and quarantine history, as part of the public’s health response to the COVID epidemic, can make people feel concerned and guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and sigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental - health care must be provided for patients of COVID-19, people who are expected to be involved with them, and the general community in need.
The psychological support must include forming a multi-discipline mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapy plans and use professional electronics to avoid contact with each other.
Effective Vaksin is especially important to dislocate the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and humans to vulnerable swimmers and often be able to complete therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by virus events.
Efforts have been made to develop a protein - based protein vaccine, which is long and effective in creating neutral antibodi and/or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, living vaccines have been reduced to experiments.
Even so, effective in vivo this vaccine’s candidate in old age and a model of verbal challenges and protection againstzonotic virus infections must be determined before a clinical study starts.
It's probably because SARS dropped 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the other hand, the MERS case and claims continued to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas because of the ongoing glootic sources in the academy area.
The vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS by using a disabled virus, DNA plasmid, virus displayors, alpsordin, particles similar to viruses, and subunital proteins and some of them have been tested on experiments.
The vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2 is safe and effective for non-imuns are a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, these difficulties are not easy to cope with long periods of time to develop vaccines and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, the COVID-19 is just beginning to show his full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients may be able to heal slowly without a schedule.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with the high mortality of patients with heavy cases.
Therefore, the formation of a prognosis disease is vital for health care to raise the services, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on a clinical study reported so far, the following factors can influence or be associated with LOVID patient prognosis (TINVID) patients:
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which is also true of COVID-19.
COVID-19 is especially at 30-65 years of age with 47, 50-year-old patients in a study of 8866 cases as explained above.
The patient who needs intensive care tends to have a birth control and complications and significant older than patients who don't need intensive care (at age 66 than 51), which imply age as a prognostic factor for the end of COVID 2001 patients.
The sex type: SARS-CoV-2 more infects men than women (0,31/100,000 than 0,27/100,000), as explained above.
Forrbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care have more likely to experience acute heart injuries and arithmetic.
Heart events also present a major cause of death for SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be blessed with colangium with ACE2-positives, which can result in emotional intervention for COVID patients.
It is important to observe that the age and the fundamental disease are extremely complex and can influence each other.
A abnormal lab guests: C-reactive proteins (CRP) in blood reflect immunation or tissue injury and be promoted as potential prognostics for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The speculation between CRP and enlightenment and Gnosis COVID-19 have also been proposed.
In addition, the increase in lmatate dehydogenase (LDH), the Amino transferase (AST), the amino transferase (ALT), and creation of type (CD) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and are released during network damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional signatures to be enabled by heart and heart.
Main clinical symptoms: The screen photo and the development of temporary clinical symptoms must be considered together with other things to predict the end result and complement COVID-19.
Hyperoid usage: As explained above, steroids are widely used as support therapy for infection disease to reduce the severity of inflamatory damage.
Because the high dose of doses is a lot used on SARS patients, many people who survive from this disease are finally suffering from avascular analysis by being enabled for a lifetime and a bad quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used on low doses and take a short period of time on COVID patients.
Mental pressure: As described above, during the COVID-19 plague, many patients suffer extraordinary stress because they have to undergo long - term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
The psychological counsel and long - term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on a demography study so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different description of an epidemic of SARS.
In addition to complications in the lower respiratory channels, SARS-CoV-2 can interact effectively on the airway above and cause light symptoms or symptoms in early stages of infection, similar to other CVs that cause pills.
Therefore, at early stages or inquivall time, infected patients can produce viruses in large numbers during everyday activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, the SARS-CoV transmission was believed to happen when patients were seriously ill and most didn't happen in the early phase.
The COVID-19 plague is thus much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS plague.
Right now, great effort is being done in China, which includes quarantine of Wiban and surrounding cities and more of the population in the hope that the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is done.
While this action is very damaging the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients is down, which indicate the delay of the epidemic.
The most optimistic notion that the plague would end in March and the drop phase lasted for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not as involved.
Paul Hunter al. Love that COVID-19, which seems to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and states that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of global population.
The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-concka and the throat of patients who had recovered and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier.
Even so, the promising signs happen in China, if seen by a drop of new cases, which shows that this strategy might work.
The re-experiency is going to cause a million cases with half also death.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease can finally be controlled.
Maybe it's similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2's ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus is not too much for human contact.
The comparison of the COVID Earth epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic is given below (Gbr. 5)
SARS-CoV-2 is so easy to be added through cough or water, and it might also have been through direct contact with the virus contaminated material.
The virus was also found in thesis so that it was possible for a new transmission, which is the transmission of the ancients-to-word transmission.
Recently at 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by unormeatial infections, which included 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health - care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions must be done to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who happen to be infected with patients or infected.
The first defense link that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of the face mask, whether a surgeon's mask and an N95 respirator (c. 1860-an) series helps control the spread of the virus.
The surgeon’s condition keeps a spark of people who are potentially infected not exposed to air or attached to the surface of the material, where the spray can be passed on to others.
However, just an N95 mask that can protect the virion inhalation with the size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can thoroughly be dotre; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, both size about 85 nm.
Because particles can market even five surgical masks to one, the patient’s direct health care providers need to wear N95 ( Number 1860-an) and not a surgeon's mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers must wear a suitable isolation coat to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a physician infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus might even get inside him by eyebending.
Hence, the health - care provider must also wear the facial shield of glances or glasses while working with the patient.
For the public community in peaceable or potentially attributable areas, it is recommended that everyone wash his hands with soap more frequently than usual, try to stay in the house for independence, and avoid contact with a infected person.
Three feet are believed to be suitable for keeping the distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of viruses.
Even though SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, his height with SARS-CoV, as reported on on January 7, 2020, must be a great warning for Chinacong who has strong memories of the ARS epidemic in 2003.
Even so, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wertan Disease Control Center said that the new virus has a new quality of lowness and infinite reproductive capacity from humans to man and prevention and the removal of the disease is not a problem.
This message is very soothing to the fear of society, especially when the whole country is preparing for the Summer Festival, so this critical time is missing for a minor illness of Whista.
The disease control body in China should learn from this and make great improvement in the future.
For example, this body should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because each word is noted and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and effective information for the clinic than to wait for official reports of doctors or authorities; (3) more restricting the potential of the disease at the beginning, and not trying to calm the public; and (4) often release a more effective and effective exercise of public awareness of disease and testing the public response to the public.
The COVID-19 COVID plague was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started to grow in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague had spread across China and over 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and COVID symptoms are similar, and SARS's plague has a similar effect on the recursion of SARS.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to take care of the epidemic and handle patients.
COVID-19 is more about older than young people and more about men than women, and the rate of death is higher than the young.
SARS Mortality is higher than COVID-19,91% more than 4.4%).
COVID patients, when they are without symptoms, usually the SARS patients are taking a virus when they are very ill, it makes a bigger problem in the COVID proclamation than the SARS.
It explains most of the reason SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wide than SARS-CoV.
A regular RNA to check the SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results on some COVID patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can give more positive results to viral examination.
These visitors have greatly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
With such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some important problems still have to be resolved, which is:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although it's found geneticled 9% between SARS-CoV-2 and two CVs are similar-SARS bats, we can't still conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from the bat.
What animal is a medium species to counter the virus from the original insulator, say bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we can't exploit the transmission effectively and the outbreak can spread back every second.
Although molecular and biokimia amication show that SARS-CoV-2 has a connection with ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the respiratory cell and cause future pathological changes?
Does this virus also link with cells that express the ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we can't reach fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How did the virus develop geneticly during transmissions between humans?
Is this academy going to be a worldwide academy, ends up like SARS, or repeats like flu?
The answers to the questions above and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
Even so, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
It's the human crown viruszonotic
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptives have moved the co- coupled to process the crown virus and its admire, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CVs (HCoV) were known to cause mild disease, such as the cold.
The cycle of heavy respiratory disease (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) turns off and reveals how HCoV infection can be very damaging and threatening.
Its SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoV look back and surprise us with high transmissions, but with higher pathogens than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV's infection is a zoonosis, therefore, the original understanding of HCoV will benefit us.
Most HCoVs are from bats to these animals, the virus is not a pathogen.
Some HCoV reservoir Iservoir was also known.
The animal's admirer has a direct implications in the prevention of human disease.
CoV-inang interaction investigation to animals can also provide an important insight about CV pathogens on humans.
In this survey, we present the general description of knowledge today about seven HCV, with focus on its discovery and its origin and its transmission.
What's important is that we compare and contrast that HCoV from the view of evolution and parcombination of the genes.
The episode of CV 2019 (COVID-19) disease is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the possible change of integrating and the implications of the virus evolution on the severity of disease are also divorous.
The crown virus (CoV) comes from Coronaviridae's family, made up of a bunch of intact RNA virus, a positive, and a single garden.
This virus has the biggest genom of 26 to 32 kilosabesa virus called "CoV", because it's like a crown under an electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CV has an insulated gene that has a similar setting.
About two thirds of a genem consisted of two large open - read frames (ORF1b) which are associated with each other. Both of them are divided into polyprotein replates pp1a and pp1ab.
Poliprotein has further processing to form 16 nontructure proteins, called ns1~16.
The genom section consists of an open beef outline (ORF) for structure proteins, which include tonjolan or cheat (S), veil or pass (E), membrane (M), and kleprotein (N).
A number of specific complement proteins for a specific genetic line are also suspended by CVlines.
Based on the difference in proteins, CV is classified to four genuss (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, malma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genuss, the beta-CoV has most HCoV and is divided into four lines (A, C, and D).
The evidence suggests that bats and dry animals are a source of genes most of the alfa-CoV and coV alfa-CoV, while aggas is the main reservoir for malma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has constantly crossed the walls of the species and some CV has become important pathogens to humans.
Until now, there are seven human CoVs (HCoV) known.
Among the seven viruses, HCV-292 and HCoV-NL63 are alfa-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV covers HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HUC1, the head virus of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory disease virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-29E, HCV-OC43, HCoV-HUKO1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as pills and/or diarrhea.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing weight - control infections in relatively more patients and have more opportunities to grow into a disease disorder of amat-t (ARDS) and show out of lung organs.
The first HCoV-29E strategy, B814, is isolated from the Ingus of patients that were fluctuated in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, the more knowledge has been collected through a deep study of HCoV-29E and HCoV-OC43, which both caused itself healing symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak occurs.
The SARS plague that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating outbreaks in history today, which infects more than 8,000 people with a violent death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory disease (MERS) led to a continuing epidemic on the Arab Peninsula by preaching the spread of different parts of the world.
HCoV's new 2019-9-nCoV, which is next known as SARS-CoV-2, is a community agent of a 2019 [COVID-19] virus disease disease disease, which has taken more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm is already ringing and the world has to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 academy to come.
Seven HCoVs all have the origin of zootics from bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of all HCoV from bats.
The COVID-19 epidemiemia has posed a significant medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge for China and the whole world.
The origin of zoonotic HCoV gave the framework of work to understand the history of nature, power of traffic, and the limits of movement between species.
These studies can also guide or facilitate the search for reservoirs, middle, and SARS-CoV-2's refroducts, which have important implications in future expansion.
In this survey, we gave a general description of the origin of zoonotics, interracial transmissions, and HCoV pathogens.
We specifically focused and discussed the general topic that HCoV's parent virus is usually nonpatogenic in its natural reservoir, but it became pathogenic after transmission to the new park.
We also note the trend in HCoV evolution that transmission skills are often accompanied by a decline in pathogenity.
The final result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
The animal CoV has been known since the late 1930s.
Before HCV-29E substrain B814 of cold patients, various CVs have been isolated from various infected animals, which include rats, rats, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few recent compounds, seven HCoVs have been identified.
Short range of HCoV's discovery history in chronology order (Table 1) is an informative lead.
The first HCoV-29E strategy is isolated from the patient's breathing channel that was exposed to the upper respiratory infection in 1966, which was later adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung.
The patient infected HCoV-292 shows symptoms of cold, which include headaches, colds, and throat pain, with fever and cough visible on 10~20% of cases.
Next in 1967, HCoV-OC43 is isolated from organ culling and sequenced series in the still smoothing brain.
The description of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to an infection caused by HCV-29E, which is symtomaticly not possible with other respiratory pathogen infections such as A and rhinus.
HCoV-29E and HCoV-OC43 are scattered across the world and tend the most sustained during the winter of the natural veral region.
Usually, these two viruses are less than a week and are followed by a sick period of about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, a healthy person infected HCoV-29E has a light cold.
Only a few patients with a weak immune system that shows a deep - breathing infection.
SARS, also known as "pneumonia aphie", is the basis of the first HCoV documented well in human history and its ethival agent is the SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first SARS case can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS Epidemide caused 8.096 cases reported with 7774 deaths, which spread in many countries and continents.
In spite of the supervel, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with a period of 4 to 7 days and the top of the virus's burden is seen on the 10th day of disease.
The patient who was infected with SARS-CoV was in the early period of a migraine, a headache, a fever, and a chill, followed by disea, cough, and breathing disorder as an advanced symptoms.
Limfopenia, an unusual heart - function test, and an increase in birth - related development is a normal lab disorder in the SARS.
The damage is replaced by alveolars, telephel cells, and macrophag increase is also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower breathing channels, some organs that include gases, hearts, and kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, often accompanied by stokin storms, which can be deadly, especially in the weak patients.
The first virus is isolated from an open lung biopsypsion of zero patients who travel to Hong Kong from 2x.
Since then, great efforts have been dedicated for HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 is isolated from a 7-month-year-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
This virus was very common to children, elderly, and infirm patients who suffered from respiratory disease.
Comriza's images, monotivitics, fevers, and bronkiolis are known to be found in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Other independent studies explain the same isolation of a virus from a eight - month-old nasal specimen of a pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Even though identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually scattered around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.5 common respiratory disease and the peak of the events occurred in the early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated withobstructructative laryntis, which is also called crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HUKO1 is isolated from a 71-year-old man who was treated because of pneumonia and bronkiolitics in Hong Kong.
Apart from pneumony and bronicist community, HCV-HUKO1 reportedly related to acute asthma ecstasy.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCV-29E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HUC1 found worldwide, causing light respiratory disease.
Four HCoVs of this entire community has been adapting to humans and generally has a small risk of mutating into a disease so-called pathogen disease. Even so, the incredible case happens because of an unknown reason, such as in a HCoV-N63 subtype case, more recently reportedly causing a severe respiratory infection in China.
Mostly, when you have the ability to move efficient and continue to defend yourself within the human, the virucity and the HCoV pathogens are also reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from 60-year-old patients who had acute pneumonia and failed her kidneys in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the lab confirmed cases come from the Middle East, the important cases with the regular secondary preaching to the close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisia lands.
Another secondary plague in South Korea in 2015 was confirmed by 186 cases.
The MERS clinical artifiation is similar to that of the SARS clinical manifest, characterized by a progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also experienced acute kidney failure, which so far happens to the MERS among HCV diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients show gastinstinol symptoms, like diarrhea and vomit.
Until February 14th 2020, over 2300 lab confirmed cases reported with the death of a high case, which is the size of 34,4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most terrifying viruses known by man.
In the middle to the end of December 2019, the professor of pneumonic patients who rederosticly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Writ, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the outbreak of the current respiratory infection and due to SARS-CoV-2 as Global Health Care Control and the COD-EV.
Until March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed around the world, with a number of violent deaths by 3.4%.
It must be noted, the death of a case in Hubei, China, at 4.2%, while the death of a case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy respiratory infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with fever, cough, and breathing.
Diare was also found on a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly grow into acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of the high nuleotide sequence, at 82%, they both group into a different branch of compounds.
The SARS-CoV-2 attention path is obviously lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 infected subject has been reported and may have played in the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with another six HCoV shows a very interesting equation and differences.
First, it's a very similar period of inculcation and a journey to HCoV's disease.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six HCoVs.
Second of all, the COVID 19th light lies between SARS-CoV and the other four HCoV-292, HCoV-OC243, HCoV-HUCTO1, and HCV-NL63).
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common image on HCoV communities infection, which includes the description of light nonspecific symptoms or even symptoms without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small fraction of a severe COVID-19 case can look like SARS-CoV infection even with a little lower ratio.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows an interesting pattern characteristics, has a screen with HCoV community and SARS-CoV.
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission skills are at least as high as HCoV community.
On the other hand, a drop of SARS-CoV-2 transmission skills after some lines on humans still need to be verified, as does SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Lastly, just like the other HCV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the sample of the ancients.
"Is the SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission action important, as in the SARS-CoV transmission case, at least in certain situations, that still has to be classified by the next study."
What is also important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasoned like in the HCoV community case.
In any case, the SARS-CoV-2 image, which includes transmission ability, pathogenity, and the spread continues in some courses on humans, would have greatly affected the end of the ongoing COVID epidemic.
Four HCoV communities that cause light symptoms of all have been adapted to humans.
Seeing from another point of view, human beings can be said to have been adapted to these four HCVs.
In other words, both HCV and humans may be the species of ancient HCoV human marketing species.
HCoV who caused a severe disease on humans and people who were in heavy HCoV sick have been destroyed.
In order for this to happen, HCoV has to apply in human number in a sufficient amount to allow adaptive amnective mutations to fight an insublution factor.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to adapt to a human.
If the virus adapts well, the transmission to humans will be difficult to quit with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For years, four CV communities have been in human population and triggering colds on people who are immune to competition.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoirs.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are highly-togened with humans and their transmissions in humans can't stand.
Both have to defend themselves and work on reproductive reservoirs and search for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or some foreman or some implification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar picture of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is so easy to compare as HCoV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCoV community and not asphogenic SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It still has to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt fully to human beings and have a complicate in humans without a reservoir or vial.
Before discussing the origin of the HCV animal, we need to discuss the characteristics and characteristics of infinity, natural, reservoirs, agents, and HCoV's amplification.
Animals act as HCoV's host if they have a very close ancestors and share high homology at the top level of nukleotide.
The ancestor virus usually adapts well and is nonpatogenic in this park.
Likewise, reservoirs carry HCoV on and in a long period of time.
In these two cases, the host was naturally infected and was a natural admirer for HCoV or parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV has just entered the media park right before or about the time the virus goes into humans, the virus has not been adapted to new areas and often has to be used to pathogens.
This middle park can function as a source of human infection and play as an amplifying effect by allowing the virus to interact for a while, then exposing it to humans to the scale of human infection.
HCoV can experience a dead infection if he can't keep his transmission in the middle park.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to middle areas and even lead to long - term endibility.
In this case, middlesides are natural reservoirs.
The epidemiology data reveals resonance that SARS's zero cases have contact history with hunting animals.
The next snoprevality study suggests that the animal dealer has an IgG anti-SARS-CoV equal to the general population.
The moon's egguma, and the seal dog in the animal market is the first to be identified with a similar SARS-CoV virus that is almost identical with SARS-CoV.
In short, this is supported by the fact that there are no more SARS cases reported since all these brokers in the market were killed.
In spite of this, it is reported that the moon is of wild nature or a farm that is not exposed to the living animal market gives most of the results of negative trials for SARS-CoV.
It must be noted, because 80% of the various animals at the market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodi, cannot be reference to that many small mammal species may also function as SARS-CoV's inside.
All these insubs seem to be an evening at the end of SARS-CoV.
The natural animal immune quest for SARS-CoV next reveals a close CV bat, which is called CV bat bat Rhlopus relatives of the HIKO3 (SARSS-Rh-BatCoCUTO3), which is found in the Chinese horse stable.
This route gave positive results for anti-SARS-CoV anti-CoV anti-RSDs and dryer-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 anti-CU3.
This CV and the other CV bat share the scoV-coV-coV-dam-drecodge-coV-dreco-cotexdge-cotide-Cleot.
It's a foundation for a new concept that bats are welcome to new human pathogens.
Some CVs are similar-SL-CoVs also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The enzyme of dysin 2 (ACE2) was known to be the SARS-CoV recipe.
The WIV1 sample of bat newborns is shown using ACE2 bats, musang, and humans as receivers to enter the cell.
Interesting thing, SARS patients convaleen can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents a common ancestor with SARS-CoV on bats, with a 95%-
In spite of the height of homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct mother virus of SARS-CoV and bat is not a live reserv reservoir naturally SARS-CoV.
Analystics group the MERS-CoV into the same group as CV-HUKO4 bats and CV-HU5 bats.
CoV-HURO4 bats and MERS-CoV uses the same immune receiver, which is the 4-monthpidil peptide 4 (DP4), as the way to enter the virus.
The RNA polymerase report depends on MERS-CoV's generally closer to his beta-CoV bat identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no MERS-CoV has been found in a wild bat.
MERS-CoV and his closest relative CV-HUK25 bat only shared 8 hagmcodiofluotide-ctide-cel.
Therefore, bats may not be live reservoir immediate MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the study of the Middle East shows that Arabic camels provide a positive result for specific antibodis that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like the Middle Eastern camel in several African countries.
MERS-CoV lives that are identical with a virus found in humans isolated from using Arabic ink ink in order to further indicate that the camel is the real reservoir senses for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that the mass virus bullets with symptoms that are usually light-subs on a set of experiments infected with the MERS-CoV.
It must be noted that the camel that infected the virus is not only through breathing routes but also through the feal-oral route, which is also the main route of the bat virus.
Even so, the question is still unrecognised because many confirmed MERS cases have no contact history with the camel before symptoms, possible because of human transmission or unknown transmission route involving an unknown animal species that brought MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of jourotide counsel with CV bat RTG13 is isolated from Rhiolopus affis bat.
As in the SARS-CoV case and MERS-CoV, secular differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to establish parent relationships.
In other words, the bat may not be the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, except if the CV bat was almost identical later found.
It is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 bives are among the species of wildlife sold and murdered in the Johnan Sea's food market, many early cases are associated with this market, which indicate the possibility of the transmission of animals.
A few recent studies based on metagenic decremification show that a small group of endangered mammals, known as milling trends (Movica), may also bring along the beta-CoV ancestors who are playing with SARS-CoV-2.
Genom CoV's new millerg shares 85-92% of decoVotide sARS-CoV-2 compounds.
However, the CV is as close as RaTG13 as in common as 90% at a kleotide dry level.
Both are grouped into two sub-CoV-2 sub-plains like SARS-CoV-2 in a tree, one of which is part of the conversing domains (RBD) which is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, in a parallel form of amino acid acidic acid at 97,4%.
What's obvious, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much different, even though the level of the whole geneom is higher.
Previously on the hospital milling trend also reported contig virus detection of lung samples, which also turned out to be associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This team adopts a different method of coding and manual curration to produce a series of parial genoms made up of about 86.3% of the virus's complete gene.
We can't rule out the possibility of grinding trends as one of the SARS-CoV-2's zoo.
However, there is no evidence currently supporting SARS-CoV-2 comes directly from milling trend because of the secular differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 mill.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and coV relatives-CAV-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 line at bat, the milling trend, and other mammals still have to be set.
Even though RBD's highest decoV-2-tin-CoV relatives-CoV-CoV-CoV-trog millers, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homicide at the top level of the entire genom.
It's too similar if it's said that the high level of moisture between RBD beta-CoV relatives-CARS-CoV2's milling and SARS-CoV-CoV-2 is moved by its selective evolution.
Hypothesis is compatible in support of a recombination between beta-CoV relatives-CARS-CoV-2 millers and RTG13 species in third animal species.
As a factor of evolutionary trafficr, recombination is much going on between my beta-CoV.
Researchers still can't decide what to do with the SARS-CoV-2 zonotic origin.
In addition to HCoV very pathogenic, the origin of zoonotic HCoV-29E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HUKO1 has also been copied.
Evidence indicates that HCoV-N63 and HCoV-29E may be from CV bats, while the HCoV-OC43 parent virus and HCoV-HUC1 has been found in the animals.
It was reported that the CoV bat named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CV) detected in the bat three colours of North America shows close contact with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-29E is geneticly associated with another CV bat, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/19, which is detected in Ghana, with Cameldae is thought to be her middlesider.
To be more clear, the knowledge at this time about the origin of the HCoV animal known in the image 1 and Table 2.
Analysis has given evidence of a transmission between HCoV transmissions in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 ran a species of cattle to infect humans, it was described as a controler of respiratory infections.
The history of the HCoV-292 transmissions is not too clear.
Afa-CoV bat that's playing with HCoV-29E has been found.
Between them, there's alfa-CoV alaka.
Some evidence supporting the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, man, not alpaca, who might be connected with bats in an ecological reunion together.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alpaca.
Secondly, the alfa-CoV bat with HCV-29E is different and nonpatogenics in the bat, while alfa-Co alpaca causes respiratory disease in an infected animal.
Lastly, alfa-CoV alpaska was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpa-CoV relatives-HCoV-29E of human beings can't be passed aside.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogen virus, which includes rabies virus, Ebol virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it's not too surprising that bats may directly compare HCoV-29E to humans.
Other possibilities, while alfa-CoV bats function as a HCoV-29E gene necklace, alpats and Arabic camels may work as a foreman's foreman-trasher that induces virus to human beings, exactly like the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is a very good example of transmission from bats to Arabic camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The MERS-CoV of bats is known to identify the beginning of the virus, and it is also reinforced with the discovery after.
Clearly, the bat is a necklace of rich species of viruses for the exchange of genetic fragment between partcare and transmissions between those of the environment.
Long age, colonies that are bound together, close social interaction, and powerful flying skills, all are conditions that support bats to be ideal virus support.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has adapted to the camel that has changed from the foreman’s park to a stable and natural reservoir pool.
MERS-CoV causes a very light disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in this animal.
The transmission of the human being happens by chance and humans remain the final memorial for MERS-CoV because its transmission can't continue.
Unlike the role of the camel in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of milling, if there is, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission different.
Especially, beta-CoV's millerg is highly pathgenic in milling.
SARS-CoV relatives of SARS-CoV-2 may be the last bride in the SARS-CoV case.
In the next study, some possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission between animals to humans must be counted or passed aside.
First, bats could be reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 relatives that are almost identical with SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the ecological necklace with bats through the cleansing or coal mining.
Second of all, milling trends could be one of the new inside-the-comV-2 implifying memorials for SARS-CoV-2 relatives virus.
People get viruses through sacrifice and consumption of meat.
Maybe, many mammals, including pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Revei antibodi against pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adapting SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that is either related to bat or grinding.
SARS-CoV-2 animal search is still under way.
In spite of the different types of animal immune, three major factors from the side of the virus are also important to make it easier for CoV to cross species barrier.
First, it's a relatively high mutation rate in RNA complications.
Compared to another single RNA virus, the rate of CV mutations can be considered "head" to "high" at an average substitite rate ~10-4 per year of course, depending on CV adapting stage to a new morning.
CoV has the eoribonic view of the corrective, deletion that results in very high skills, extension, or even invibility.
Interesting thing, Breleotide syndrome is known to suppress CV's replication through this hybialiclease inhibition and polymerase RNA depend on-RNA.
Redesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical experiments.
Even so, the CV amputation rate is about a million times higher than the rate of imputation.
Besides, mutation speed is often high when CV hasn't been adapted to a host.
Compared with the SARS-CoVs that have a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate actually lower, indicate higher adaptive levels to humans.
Likely, the SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another host who is close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this applies to the MERS-CoV that has been adapted to Arabic camels.
On the contrary, it is unlikely that genetic diversity will quickly make vaccines and agents available to SARS-CoV-2 to be ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genom in CV gave extra flexibility in genom modifications, for mutation and recombination, thus boosting co-evolutionary probbility, which is profitable to appear a new CoV at the right time.
It is supported by a wide range of unique open readings and a protein function suspended toward the end of 3m.
Third, CV is often reverberated in random complications during RNA complications through unique "elect-salin" mechanism.
In a swim that works as a mixing container, untairy transition often occurs during the RNA CV transcryption.
The complete RNA and very homology subgenics can be recombined to form new CoVs.
The evidence of natural recombination has been found on HCoV-HUKO1 and HCoV-OC43, as does the CoV animals like SL-CoV bat and CV-HUKO9 bats.
Interaction virus in connection with transmission
In addition to three factors mentioned above, virus interaction with immune receivers is another major factor that affects interracial transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a typical example, which also shows positive proof during the events of inter-struction transmission.
Based on similar analysis between SARS-CoV human and musang, SARS-CoV is thought to have a quick adapting in various in safest conditions, especially with the mutation on the S. R.D.
Mostly, RBD protein S CV interacts with cell receivers and intensively becomes a target of ink antibodi antibodi immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318 amino acid to the 510 fragment S1, which makes a connection with human ACE2 and his driver as a virus entrance.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receivers, which include bats, bosangs, rats, and dog raccoons, thus allowing the transmission of the virus between the environment.
In fact, only 6 amino acid reviews that are not considered to be different between human and mustiant virus in RBD and 4 of them are located at reception motives for interacting with the ACE2 receivers.
SARS-CoV Mussang has K479N and S487T in his RBD, which may increase in order to increase their protein interaction with the ACE2 receiver.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
It must be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receiver as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein units is applied so that the combination of protein S with ACE2 is likely to change.
In fact, a chryo-EM study shows for human binding and SARS-CoV-2 protein 10 times higher than the size of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV proteins.
It's also important to know whether there's another driver that might be necessary for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interesting thing, HCoV-NL63 is also agreed with ACE, but with a different part of S.
There's a lot of HCoV receivers, like aminoptide N for HCoV-29E and a 9-O-thestile acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also have a role in the ability to adapt this CV in humans after the transmission between their animal insubence.
In addition to cell receivers, the end result of HCoV transmission between 17s is also set up by other dependencies and barriers.
The difference between individual and natural reservoir proteins, such as bats, Arab camels, and dry animals, can be a barrier to interracial transmission.
HCoV must take over the factor of insublution and breaching the insublution factors to make it work in inter-strupt transmission.
In this case, molecular selection in the field of these important virus interaction still has to be identified and characterized.
The whole genom didn't have to look at the pressure and restrictions of SARS-CoV-2's eye-responsive technology might be useful.
New HCoV display: Back to the beginning of the plague
CoV bat religion gives a huge chance to appear new HCoV.
In this case, CV bats function as a HCoV gene necklace.
In addition, rapid and genetic recombination also move HCoV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, getting or losing a new protein reserving gene potentially modified the phenotype virus dramatically.
Among the SARS-CoV's access proteins, orF8 are expected to play an important role in adapting to humans because the family-SARS-CoV virus found in different ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a typical deletion of 29 nucleus found in a single exhibit that was isolated at the start of the human epidemic.
This removal separates theORF8 to orF8a and orORF8b and is thought to be a adaptive mustation that supports insub.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alfa-CoVlines and malmma-CoV, with a large number of smaller compound areas identified in the polymerase RNA that depend on RNA.
The location of recombination is also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and most of the nsp14.
And so, the recombination between various descendants is shown at the MERS-CoV epidemic, which happens in the Arab Arabic camel.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in HCoV another HCoV where HCoV has a recombinated with other animal CoV in his nonstructial gene.
Also, it should be cautious that artificial selection can play on an accidental change in the Genom villa, likely resulting from the virus release of the election pressure, such as by an immune system.
The example of this effect is the loss of ORF4 complete on the HCoV-29E prototype because of the removal of two kleotides.
While ORF4 can be observed on bat viruses and camels that run with HCoV-29E, alfa-Copaca shows a single kleotide joint that leads to a pattern shift.
Lastly, new HCoV evolution was also moved by the pressure of the selection of his reservoirs.
A light or without symptoms detected when a CV bat is infected, which shows adapting between CoV and bat.
It seems that bats adapt well to CV in anatomy and physiology.
For example, defects in the effects of proinflamation response to the bat will drop the pathology that CV is consistently triggered.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in the bat is pressed because of the increase in a typical NKG2/CD94 cell reactions and lower class-class molecular expression rate of hycocompatibility.
In addition, the high level of active oxygen species (ROS) of high metabolic activity can suppress CV reactions and influence exposure by the exception of an atomic view so that it gives selection pressure to create a highly pathic virus extract when it gets into a new event.
More path CVs may also develop through recombination, resulting in obtaining new protein or protein features to adapt in on a swim.
Therefore, it's not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two compounds.
CoV is nonpatogenic or may cause light symptoms in his reservoir areas, such as bats and camels.
CV's repetitively strong without triggering a strong immune response.
Here lies the secret of a host without symptoms and the cause of heavy cases of human infection.
The heavy symptoms are especially due to the excessive effect of immunicated immune reactions and cytokin storms, with increasing lung damage if imun response is getting stronger.
On the other hand, to the bringer without symptoms, the immune response has been removed from CV applications.
The same strategy to decide the link of imun response might be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially powerful on bats.
Therefore, an interferon type I, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection to humans, should be useful.
In addition, the NLRP3 in bats is defectative.
With this reason, inhibiasam NLRP3 inhibiasion with MC950 may be useful in COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 feature follows the general SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV view.
While the Beta-CoV bat that shares 95% of nucleus with SARS-CoV has been found, there's also CoV bat that shares 96% of nukleotide with SARS-CoV-2.
Even though the man and the other animals in the market were found carrying an identical virus with SARS-CoV, direct features for SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.
Beta-CoV is a very gay mill with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which shows that milling trends may play as one of the media sensors or beta-CoVergs may contribute gene fragments to the end of SARS-CoV-2 version.
Though still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by both humans by accident and by accident.
CV is back to the center of attention because of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak recently.
The CoV team in bats and other animals has greatly changed our perceptions about the origin of zootics and animal reservoirs for HCoV to human transmission.
So much evidence indicates that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 came from bats and was manipulated to humans through middle areas.
Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and msang in the wet market, maybe the wet market cover and the killings of all the killings in it that end the SARS epidemic effectively.
With the same reason, milling trend should be moved from the wet market to prevent thezonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lines of the beta-CoV millergs that are associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms to humans through milling trends and other mammals still have to be classified in the study in the future.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in Arabic camels.
This camel serves as an important transport tool and as a main source for meat, milk, skin, and wool products for local people.
Arab camel spread across the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we can't kill all the camels to control MERS, as they do in a wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS plague, a composite approach must be done to develop a vaccine for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other forms of infection control.
Before we get rid of this virus, the new genotype can appear and cause the plague.
The CoV of zoonotics walks in the wild.
In particular, CV bats are potentially glonoticly diverse.
There's a lot of possibilities for this CV zoonotic to evolve and recombination, resulting in a new CV that is easier to be tested and/or more deadly for humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China has to be abandoned to reducing contact that does not need between humans and animals.
With the SARS ’ bitter experiences, MERS, and COVID-19, preparing and planning better to apply.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet since ancient times.
These viruses are in their natural reservoirs until there's a chance to preach.
Although bats have many features supporting the spread of the virus, the chances of human contact with bats and other species of wild nature can be eliminated if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
Surveillans continued against mammals need to be done to understand CV and its natural environment, which will prove helpful in preventing the transmission of animal and future plague.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the zonocosic virus is that humans have to keep the distance from the eclogical reservoir natural natural viruses of the zoonotic virus.
Some of the original riddles of zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 have not been found yet.
First, if the bat gets the SARS-CoV-2 virus into milling, the conditions when the bat and the size of the mill share the ecology necklace are important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans are connected with bats must be determined.
Third, if there's a third mammal that plays as a true mediator reminder, how it interacts with other species, which includes humans, bats, and milling trends should be explained.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that might be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both experiment infections and surveys have to be done.
Whether bats, millers, or other mammals, are expected that the SARS-CoV-2 or its parent virus can be identified in its natural environment in the future.
The continued investigation in this field will outline the SARS-CoV-2 pipeline in the animal, with important implications in prevention and field control of COVIDs.
The update of the "unexpect" diagnosis and "the confirmed case" of the COVID 19rd need to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice for diagnosis and the handling of new coronary infections.
Even so, the talvirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease is a new disease, our awareness, and our knowledge increased based on current research findings and medical experience clinically; therefore, the strategy of diagnosis and care for is being updated as well.
In this letter, we answered one of the comments on our guidance and provided the latest diagnosis for "undespoiled" and "spects confirmed" because of the Dignosis Guide and the Call for COVID19 (the seventh Century) produced by the National Health Commission of the Chinese Republic.
In December 2019, the new crownvirus has caused a plague, which is now officially called coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) and it is named the crownvirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a academy.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed the quick advice guide and the guide has been published online in the Military Medical Research on February 6th 2020.
They have been intrigued by it since published.
However, it needs to be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge increased based on ongoing research findings and medical experience clinically; therefore, the strategy of diagnosis and care being renewed also continues to be updated.
For example, the Dignosis Guide and the Caller for COVID-19, produced by the Chinese People’s Health Commission (ht.n.hc.gov.c.cn.), between January 16 January 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has produced seven total editions with some context changed quite much.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced simple score scores based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds to their new evidence of this guidance and provides us with a life - sustaining reference to the academy around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
Even so, their work also requires updates based on Diagnosis Guide and serviceal for the latest seventh test and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition ( March 3, 2020), to confirm the combination of the expected cases requires a combination of the history of epidemiology with two clinical manifestations to create a systematic analysis, or the need for a series of three clinical deaths if there is no clear history of epidemiology:
The history of epidemiology: (1) a travel history or live in the city of Whab and surrounding areas, or another community where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the symptoms; (2) contact history of the SARS-CoV-2 (with positive acid trials); (3) contact history with patients who have a fever or symptoms of nearby town and other cases of LOVID cases reported in the last 14 days; (4) the patient’s history of the hospital, or 2 weeks of the hospital disease.
Lininistic quality: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) feature of LOVID infection infection; (3) total count of the white blood cells shows a normal reality count, decline, or decline in early habitat stages.
The diagnosis of the case has to be based on an unexpected case with one of the reasons for pathogens as follows: (1) positive real-time pCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the absence of the entire virus shows a highion of the new coronavirus; (3) positive for antibody Invalid and antibog IG on SAR-V-2 in testing; or an I'm a positive rate of recovery in the I.
We can see that the real-time pCR test of nullic acid is in the sample of respiratory or blood added to the second edition ( January 20,20) and the third January 2020).
A togenic selection of blood samples added to the fourth edition (27 January 20,20) and the fifth ( February 2020); then, it was added to the seventh edition.
This phenomenon is based on continued research that researchers have been working to find a certain antibodi acid detectoric acid detect for quick molecular diagnosis, as well as samples of the breathing channel including blood taking, which increases the supply of various specimens, and supports the positive resuscitation of the resulting of the particular antibodi into the implied criteria.
Moreover, there are more evidence that reminds us to be alert to patients with aphids and symptoms without symptoms.
Therefore, the alir alir al. must be updated because they're describing people without clinical symptoms as "serious."
The score system also needs to be verified in practice and clinical studies in the future.
As a cover, we hope that more immediate evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
For the diagnosis of "unfatus" and "the confirmed case," we suggest that we follow and obey the latest guidance in each country.
Our team will also renew our guidance time and again as help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
It's the highest number of deaths in one day because of that virus.
Up to yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported Bangladesh cases including 114 active cases and 33 home recovery cases.
A total of 17 deaths.
In a online non-temon, director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death covered four men and women.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two-year-old cases, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41-50.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (HO) expressed COVID 19 as a academy.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agentcy, a local news office, that one who died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Watchtower Committee, who was treated at the Matrere Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Minister Transportation and Bridge, Obadul Quader said general transportation will be stopped longer than planned, until next Saturday.
This general transport stop has begun since March 26, and planned to end on Saturday, April 4, April.
The transfer of basic necessities -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first 15-century COVID infection recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8, on two new arrivals from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds a million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 high-end virus infections exceeds a million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, the disease caused by the crown virus.
The peak occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed the infection of the first crown virus and Zambia had his first death associated with the crown virus.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country was one of the few countries that remained free from the infection of the crown virus.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79.332 cases in twenty-four hours since the Middle European Time (0800 UC) on April 4.
In the United States (U.S.), it has been recorded that more than 244 grand cases of crown virus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News office reported, quoting Johns Hopkins University data, has over 1,000 deaths in the United States that resulted from the infection of the crown virus.
All over the world, the countries announce a tighter action to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, extended the province to May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would still be paid without having to go to work until April 30th.
Portugal's Parliament has taken a voice to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote has escaped with 215 voices supporting, ten abstain sounds, and one voice refuses.
Saudi Arabs extend the hours of the night in the holy city of Mekkah and Champa until all day; before, the night was only between three and six o'clock in the morning.
Thai plans to apply the night between 10 o'clock and 4 in the morning.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country had extended the order to stay in the house until May 1.
The stores in Australia have dropped the cost limit of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australia Woolworth's store network and Coles dropped off the toilet tissue line to two and a trading pack at all shops on national level.
ALDI also applied one limit, sir, on Monday.
This border was announced as a message in the cash and on the Facebook page of its network.
The buyer was reported saving supplies because of the fear of the COVID- - if people had to do independent isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases to deliver to the house until one pack ordered.
This change followed the restraint of four packs of transactions that have already been applied to Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March.
In his 8th media statement, Coles reported that by performing the restraint of the four packs, "many stores are still running out in an hour since the delivery," and calling that request "never happened before", while ALDA, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called "unpredictant".
One of Woolworth's speech guys last week, according to one of Woolworths.
Costco shop in Canberra also restricted the amount allowed until two months ago.
To avoid denial, Coles ordered more packs of suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI prepared for special Wednesday promotions available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of Australia’s Pertel Association, says that the peripherals are trying to improve supplies, but local government limits for truck shipments make it difficult.
He anticipated a production raise, while a supplier tries to fulfill a request, and a little less special promotion.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of taking off early supplies, some stores can't hold special Wednesdays.
In a news.com report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail scholar from Queensland University of Technology, says the store fills supplies every night.
He emphasized that toilet tissue is a great piece of stuff so that the amount of supplies is low and, if sold out, makes lots of free space on the shelfs so that the expectation of goods is getting more.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and immunization can [bus] and there's a huge amount of, panic might be started by the Zimmerman through the ABC News Department.
The toilet tissue producer Who Gives said on Wednesday last that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Tisu Toilet Kleenex, and Somis Pater, who made Sorbent, stressed them work 24/7 to keep the supply, according to News.com report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some property dealers offer free toilet tissues to the first bidder in Melbourne, when a few auctions are held because buyers took up their pause for long holiday holidays.
This Thursday NT News, a day printed in Darwin, includes eight pages of expansion meant to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores actually refused to apply the boundaries, according to the Australian ABC report on March 3, they said that they didn't plan to apply the purchase limit.
Russell Zimmerman added that other product is also in high demand, including masks, vellums, dry food, laundry, and flour.
And so outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon British Ocado was observed restricting the purchase of your Memorial toilet paper to two packs of 12 scrolls.
The World Health Organization (WO) states COVID-19 as a academy
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (HO) declared the currently occurring COVID epidemic -- the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronaryal.
Although the word "condemer" only refers to how wide the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO records the need to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change this desert trip.
If the country detects, takes care, isolates, and mobilizes its people as response, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebrereesus, director General WHO.
We are very concerned about the level of preaching and the sorrows that are concerned, or because of the level of concern.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center Control and Prevention of U.S. disease, this academy "has never happened before."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "in addition to influence, no respiratory transmission virus ever tracked from its appearance to the continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We've never seen a pandemed by the crownvirus."
He continued, "and we've never seen a conversity that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status of academy followed the decision of WHO in January that declared this plague to be a threat to society that was ruining the world.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectivesion in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "The outbreak, it's going to get worse."
Until Thursday, Assocated Press reports there are at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases around the world, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The next 20-20-year-old Grandvirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) that continues and caused by acute acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The bee was identified at Wiba, China, in December 20,19, as a Human Health Center that restored the World on January 30, 2020, and as a mouthpiece on March 11, 2020.
Up to 10 April 2020, approximately 1.6 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and the most influential region, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
Around 27,000 people have recovered.
The fatal number of cases is estimated 4% in China, while worldwide is about to start from 13,04% to 0.8% in New Zealand.
Public symptoms cover fever, cough, and breathing.
Compitions can cover pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
Time from the exposure to the awitan of symptoms in most of five days, but it could range from two to fifteen days.
No known vaccine or specific analytic treatment.
The primary treatment is sympathic and positive therapy. Preventions that are recommended include washing hands, closing their mouth while coughing, keeping away the distance from others, and monitoring and isolation is back to people who are suspected infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by performing travel limits, quarantines, hours, danger control of the workplace, and the completion of the facility.
This academy has caused a heavy global economic breakdown, a disavocation of cultural, political, religious, political, political activity, political activity, the sport, and the extent of the supply of the supplies that are quarried with panic purchases.
School and university have been closed both on national and local levels in 193 countries, which affects some 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
Misinication of this virus has spread online and there is a xenophobia incident and discrimination against Chinese people, people with Eastern and Southeast Asian looks, and people who come from the area with significant virus cases.
As a result of a drop in travel and heavy industrial closings, air pollution and carbon emissions are dropping.
Health Authority in Witat, Chinakok (the capital of propinsi Hubei), reported pneumon case claims with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was done at the beginning of January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Merchan's food market and therefore the virus is supposed to have the origin of zootics.
The virus that caused the plague is called SARS-CoV-2, a new virus found and associated with the crown of bats, the crowns of milling, and the SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms and then known to be sick on December 1, 2019, and he doesn't have a clear link with the list label later.
Among the early claims reported on December 20,19, two-perters were found to have a connection with the market.
On March 13, 20,20, a report not yet verified from South China Morning Post estimates that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from the Hubei province, was probably the first.
There may be a large number of reported cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
Until February 26, a relatively few cases reported between young men, with 19 years of age, formed 2.4 percent of cases around the world.
The case refers to the number of people who have tested COVID-19 and whose results have been confirmed positive according to official protocol.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3 percent of its population, and many countries have made official policy not to test people with light symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published in March 16, found that in China, up to 23 January, 86% of COVID infection is not detected, and that this un-deservated infection is a source of infection for 79% of the reported cases.
A statistics published in March 30, predict that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be greater than the reported case.
The initial estimate of basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1,4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Control Center and Prevention of the United States concluded that the figure was possibly 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers are cured.
For those who are not cured, the time from the development of symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10th 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In China, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred on people over 60 years and 75% had a previous health disorder, which included diabetes and diabetes. The official estimate of deaths of COVID is generally referring to the dead who gave positive results for COVID according to official protocol.
The actual fatality number of COVID-19 may be much higher, considering an official number of possible to include people who die without being tested, for example, at home, in the care home, dsb.
The partial data from Italy found that an excess number of deaths during the deserting over the official COVID death count with a 4-5 times as much.
A woman speaking for the U.S. Control Center and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the number of announced deaths] is lower than actual number", a statement that is inspired by non-inductive reports about the excessive calculations in the U.S.A., which is too low on accounts, as in H1.1. 2009 flu epidemic confirmed at January 2020.
The first death outside the mainland occurred on February 1, the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
Until February 28th, outside the mainland Chinese, more than dozen deaths recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Until March 13th, over forty countries and the teritorial regions have reported deaths on every continent, except Antarctica.
This figure varied according to areas and time - long, and is influenced by the number of tests, health - care qualities, treatment options, time from the first plague, and character of the population as age, gender and health as a whole. The ratio of death to the case reflects the number of deaths being diagnosed in a specified interval of cases.
Says Johns Hopkins University, the death ratio on global cases is 6.0% (97.039/1.617204) per April 102020.
This figure is varied according to the region.
In China, the estimate of death to the case goes down from 17.3% (for people with symptoms of 1-10 January 2020) to 0, decibels (for a person with a history of symptoms after February 1 2020). Another rate covers the fatality of cases (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those who died of certain diseases, and the fatality of infections (IFR), which shows the percentages of people who are infected (the disease), which are not diagnosed with certain diseases.
These statistics are not connected and followed a certain population from infection to the resolution of the case.
A number of numbers have been trying to count these numbers for a certain population.
Between idence-Bassed Medicine University of Oxford predicts the fatality of infection for all over 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above range of these estimates is along with the result of first random testing for the COVID-19 in Germany and a statistics that analyze the impact of the gain on CFR estimate.
The WHO confirms that this academy can be controlled.
The peak and end of this epidemic are not obvious and it may be different according to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said: "Without control, the epidemic is usuallyers and then it begins to decline when the disease runs out of the watery deep.
But it's almost impossible to make a reasonable projection now about when it happens.
The senior medical advisor of the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan said that "this plague might end June" if the whole country could be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
In March 17th, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiene & Troiscal Medicine said that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to move on, possibly for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other steps will be needed "until vaccines are available (in existence 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I guess it's a small possibility that the crownvirus, because it's very easy to take care of, can disappear completely" and the disease "it might turn into a season disease, which comes back every year."
The repeated use of speech will depend on group immunity and mutation levels.
COVID's symptoms can be relatively specific and people infected can be without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fevers (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory snail production (fllegma), loss of smell, severeness of breath, pain and muscle pain, headaches, headaches, headaches, fever, diarrhea, or synosis. WHO states that about one of six people get sick and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed emergency symptoms to include respiratory difficulty, anguish or chest pain living, sudden confusion, and range on the face and lips; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms arise. Further disease developments can be severe ones, my respiratory disease syndrome, sepsis, sepsis, sepsis, and death.
Some infected people may be asimtomatics, that is, without clinical symptoms, but with the results of tests confirming infection, researchers suggest that those who are associated with infected people should be held tight and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate asimtomic ratio ranged from a few to 44%.
A period of incultation (the time between infection and awitan symptoms) is usually between 1 and 14 days, at most of the time 5 days. For example, the estimated number of people who lost their initial sense of smell, and then went down to 15%.
The details of the way this disease spread are still being studied.
The COVIDS Service is believed to be especially at close contact times and through a small drop that results when coughs, water, or speech; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 feet [2 to 6 m] (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that undigned coughs may cause decompletions to be pushed as far as three feet [4.2 m] to 8.2 feet (27 m).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be transmitted by a tiny loot that lasts longer in the air and results when it comes to speech.
Drotletts can fall in the mouth or the nose of the person who's near him or may be corrupted into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as introducation and lung remation, can make a secret breathing turn into aerosol and then spread through the air.
The list can also occur when a person touches the surface that is contaminated, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through fetuses, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government parses the possibility of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission of fecal-oral.Virus is most contagious in the first three days after the awitan symptoms, though the preaching may occur before the sight and at an advanced stage of disease.
People are giving positive results to three days before the show of symptoms, which indicate transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Just a few reports of aimtomatic cases confirmed by lably, but assimomatic transmission have been identified by some countries when contact tracking investigations.
The European Prevention and Control Center (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easy it is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others, it can last on the surface for hours until days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected up to three days on plastics and steel under 304, one day on quarantine, and over four hours on copper.
However, it's a different matter of moisture and temperature, as well as other pets and animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can infect the virus to humans, although the British authorities suggest to wash their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have been touched by an infected person.
Koonavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumony sufferers associated with the claims of acute respiratory disease in Wur.
All features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to the crownvirus in nature. This virus outside of the human body can be destroyed if it's hit by home soap, which destroys its protective envelope.
The virus is supposed to have the origin of zoonotics.
Genetic analysis reveals that the crown of the crowns are geneticly linked to the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B) along with two bat - bites.
This virus has 96% in all levels of genom with another tidal sample of the bat (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researcher China discovered that there was only one amino acid in certain parts of the genes between milling and human viruses.
Up to this point, the comparison of the entire genom found at least 92% of the genetic material between the millivirus and SARS-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that the milling is the SARS-CoV-2 engineer.
Infection by the virus can be diagnosed while based on symptoms, but confirmation is at last carried out by the reaction of polymerency transcripation chain (rRT-PCR) on the infected screct or preserving CT.
A study that compares PCR with CT at WSU shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many features of quadrupts associated with pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as the first test in COVID-19 diagnosis."
The WHO has published several RNA tests protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was released first on January 17th.
Test using the reaction of polymerase transcrisp for real-time (rRT-PR) chain reaction chain reaction.
Testing can be done on breathing or blood samples.
The results are generally available in hours to a few days.
Mostly, these tests are done on nasopharing uses, but using throats can also be used. A number of labs and companies are developing a form of molecular tests that detect antibodi.
On April 6, 2020, not one of these synthesis tests proved accurate enough to ensure its use in a wide range.
In the U.S.A., a synthesis test developed by Celexi has been approved for emergency use, only by the identifying lab.
The characteristics of radiography and stomography feature on people who are symtomaticly inclined to include an aysmic opacity of aysphetri and there are no pleura efusi.
Radical Society Italians are setting up international online databases for introductions on confirmed cases.
Because of the infection associated with other infections such as shamavirus, citration without PCR confirmation has a limited specimen in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of the CT breast with the PCR and show that even though less specific for infection, it is more sensitive and more sensitive to it that it is recommended to be a filter in the epidemic area.
The environment of artificial intelligence environment has been developed to detect the feature of virus screening with radiography and CT.
The strategy to prevent the transmission of this disease includes keeping a good personal cleaner freshly, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, noses, or mouth before washing your hands, and wearing tissues while it sinks and immediately dumps tissues into the trash.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
The government in various regions has limited or encouraged to stop all absences to and from countries and areas affected by the plague.
However, the virus has reached the extent of the human scale in most areas of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some community members have no idea where or how they are infected. Health care providers who deal with people who may be infected are advised to perform standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact control is an important step toward the health authorities to determine the sources of infections and prevent further transmission.
The use of data locations from the government's cell phones for this purpose has triggered a matter of privacy, with the exit of Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations calling for this kind of survey.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or submitted to voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than groups of experts are working private friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the distance of the user to another cell.
Next, users will receive a message if they are close to someone that's positive for COVID-19. Check out the misunderstanding about how to prevent infection; for example, wipe your noses and powder with the poor treatment.
No COVID-19 vaccine, though many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing hands is encouraging to prevent the spread of disease.
The CD recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hand looks dirty; before eating; and after a nose, cough, or sink.
It's because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by household soap that damaged its protective layer.
Further, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol - based use of hand - based mutilation with a minimum of 60% alcohol content based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages not to touch the eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontamiated using a number of solution (in a minute ’ sinsinctant reference to rusty steel surfaces), including etanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, ditrium population 0.1%, hydrogen persecide%, and podone-od-iine 02,5%.
Other details, such as corzalconium corride and correctionin gluct, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is an unexpected COVID case or confirmed in public facilities, such as office or child shelter, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, electronic devices along like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines that are used by patients, have to be infected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with elbows that are torn or used with tissues when coughing or elders and then dump tissues immediately.
The surgeon is recommended for a person who may have been infected because using masks can limit volume and range access to an explosive thumb that spreads when speaking, elders, and coughs.
The WHO has issued instructions about time and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "using masks can reduce people’s tendency to touch their faces with unwashed hands, which is a source of major transmission." Despite being recommended to be used by others who may suffer this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for CIVID 19-century sufferers, even though WHO also admits that using masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to push masks into public members.
In the United States, the CDC recommended the use of nonmedic face masks made of cloth. The Chinese specifically recommend the use of medical masks once used to healthy people, especially when near (1 m) or less) by others.
Hong Kong recommends operating masks while using public transport or living in crowded places.
Thailand’s health office encourages making masks in the house and washing them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia had forbidden its people to go out into public places without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austria government requires everyone who enters the hospital to wear a face mask.
Israel asked all of his citizens to wear face masks while they were in public.
Taiwan, which produced ten million masks a day since mid - March, requires railroad passengers and city buses wearing face masks per April 1.
Panama requires the use of facial masks every time she goes outside the house, and recommends making her own facial masks for those who can't buy the face masks.
The faceline is also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restraint (also called physical restraint) is an act of infection control intended to slow down the spread of disease by exposing contact between individuals.
Social restrictions cover restrictions; travel restrictions; and closings, places, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can apply social restrictions by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding public areas, using unconciliating, and maintaining physical distance from others.
At present, many governments are demanding or decommunicating social restrictions in the region of the plague.
The maximum number of people gathered by U.S. bodies and health organizations quickly reduced, from 250 people (if not known as COVID-19 in a region) became 50 people, and then it became 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany forbade the meeting in the public area involving more than two people. Lansia and people with fundamental medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immune system that has a risk of serious illness and higher complications are recommended for the best possible home of the disease in the area. At the end of March 2020, U.S.A., U.S.S.S.A., the use of the term for "s" is a physical level of physical level, or a physical level of physical connection, or a physical level of contact.
The use of the term "so - called social boundaries" implies that people should isolate themselves completely and not encourage people to stay in touch with others through alternative ways. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the period.
This reminder includes the encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or virus symptoms.
The isolation of self - esteem at home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and people who are suspected infected.
The health bodies have issued detailed instructions for the true isolation, many governments are demanding or recommend independence for all of the families who live in peaceed areas.
The most strict independence instructions were issued for those who were among the high - risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and those who recently traveled to countries or territories with a wide-early COVID message are advised to do a 14 - day quarantine from the last time of exposure.
The strategy in outbreak control is a drowning or presupposion, and my speculation.
The removal was done at the early stages of the plague and was designed to track and isolate the infected person and do other steps for infection and vaccination that were intended to stop the spread of disease to the entire population.
When no longer possible to improve the spread of disease, further efforts turn to the stage of my observation: these steps are taken to slow down the spread and reduce its effects to health care systems and society.
Combination of cloud action and my awareness can be done at the same time.
Supreci needs more extreme steps to reverse the academy by reducing the basic reproductive number to less than 1. The amount of disease management is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, which is known to be the result of an epidemic curve.
It reduces the risk of being overwhelmed by health care and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Intervention nonfamacated to handle the plague includes individual precautions, such as hand hygiene, using facial masks, and independence; steps at the level of society that are directed to physical restrictions, such as closing school and canceling mass meetings; society’s involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in this kind of operation; and such steps in the environment, such as cleaning of the surface, other significant measures that are intended to occur in China during the outbreak, which it becomes more real-staining, like an all-streailing of the city.
Other countries also apply various steps that are intended to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduces mass filters and local quarantines, and warns about the movement of people who are infected.
Singapore gives financial support to an infected person who's committed self - quarantine and is wearing a huge fine for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of face - to - face masks and executes medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that my spending is slow, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic, and subpression has a great challenge.
The optimological policy can reduce the peak request for health care until 2/3 and half deaths, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and hard health systems.
The subpression can be selected, but the need to be preserved during the virus is still in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first done), because if it is not, the transmission will fly back quickly when the subpression steps are deducated.
Long-term events for pressing bread have a bearing on social and economic impact.
There's not yet a specific drug approved for COVID-19, but the development effort is being done, which includes testing existing drugs.
Presuming free flu drugs, drinking enough water, and rest can help ease symptoms.
Depends on the level of enlightenment, oxygen therapy, intraventa fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can make the patient's condition worse.
Some of the compounds previously approved for other virus treatment are being tested to use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some traditional drug and shelters can ease symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-Co-Co-19.
WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID patients is a basic step in responding to outbreak.
ECDC and its office of the European regional WHO has provided guidance for hospitals and primary health services to distract resources in various levels, including focusing on lab services for LOVID-19 testing, if possible to cancel electromagnetic procedures, separate and isolate positive patients, and improve intensive care by training personnel and increasing the number of the ventilators and sleeping quarters.
There's a variety of theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first new coronary case known to be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wiba, Hubei, China.
In a month, the number of coronary cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Merchan's Grine food market, which also sells living animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, by other words, virus has the origin of zootics. A pneumonic club with an unknown cause of death on December 26 and is handled by Dr Jixian in the hospital of Hubei, which knows CDCWhantantan in December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the W.A. Center Hospital told their colleagues about "coronavirus like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenong, were warned by the police for spreading false villages, and others, Ai Fen, was reproved by his superiors for warning.
The Wurt City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31, and told WHO.
Quite a number of pneumony cases are not reported to the health authorities in Wabur, which then triggered an investigation in early January, at the beginning of the plague, the number of cases increases twice every seven and a half days.
In early and mid - January 2020, the virus spreads to other Chinese provinces, supported by foreign migrations during the New Year Imek and because Wpat was a major transport center and transit train transit.
On January 20, Chinese reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one person in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.
About 200 countries and isolated regions have at least one case.
Because of the academy in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Region have restricted free movement and made border control.
The national response covers steps, such as quarantine (known as the command to live in houses, orders to take refuge in places, or to keep the territory in the area of the South Africa, and at 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, are in some kind of quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a kind of province quarantine, which grew to 2.6 billion people two days later, about one third of the world’s population.

It also led to 33-43% traffic traffic to a shopping center in March compared with February.
The world’s central shopping providers perform additional steps, such as the increase in sanitation, thermal scanation to check the buyer's temperature, and the revocation of the event.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of an epidemic in Wurb, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In March 20, 2020, over 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government aid.
According to the Federal Resterve Bank of St. Louis, the coronary plague can cause loss of 4 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates can reach 32%. The Indian region has caused tens of millions of innocent Indian workers (who have been paid by daily wage) in unemployed. Survei of Angus Reed Institute found that 44 percent of Canadian houses have lost their jobs.
During the second half of March, 4 million French employees put up temporary unemployment and 1 million British employees filed universal credit schemes.
German short-term work compensation was adopted by France and England.
All over the world, the art and cultural heritage of the world are closely associated with human history, which affects the operation of organizations and individuals, both both working and independent.
The art and cultural sector organization is trying to maintain the high level of their mission (which often the public fund) to provide cultural heritage access to society, to keep employees and people's safety, and to support artists if possible.
In March 20,20, throughout the world and at a different level, museums, libraries, shows places, and other cultural institutions were closed without time, with exhibitions, shows, and the show was canceled or delayed.
In response, intense efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another damage to this latest and very rapidly developed disease is a religious treatmentalization, large sports events, and other social events, such as music and concerts, technology conferences, as well as displaying.
The Vatican also announced that the Holy Mosque in Rome, which fell on the last week of Prapah Christian repentance season, was canceled.
Many compassions encourage older Christians to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services through radio, direct broadcasts, or television, while others offer drive or baptismal worship.
With the veils of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Couscons and the teto of Peter’s Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled the services and restrict public meetings in the church, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gudwara.
Iran's health record announces the revocation of the Friday prayer in the region of the plague and places of worship and then is closed, while Saudi Arabia forbids foreign pilgrimages and its inhabitants to the sacred places of Critan and Latin America.
This academy has caused the most significant disturbance of the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most big sports events were canceled or postponed, including the Champions League 20192020, the Premier League 20202020, the OPEFA Euro 2020, NBA 2020, and NHL 30th century 202020.
The plague was ruining the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would “responst until after 2020, but it wouldn't be over the summer of 2021."
This has caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites report significant new registration increases, and the entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delayed or canceled all concerts.
A lot of big theaters like Broadway also delay all the show.
Artists explore various ways to continue producing and sharing the works over the Internet as alternative to traditional live shows, such as a direct broadcast concert online or to create a web based on artists to perform, spread, and publish their work.
A lot of megavirus’s Internet is growing online by many people who turn to humor and distraction in the middle of uncertainty.
Since the development of the COVID-19, there has been a growing prejudice, xenophobiia, and racism against China’s descendants and East Asia, as well as people from the surrounding areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia-Pasific regions.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) recorded racist sentiments revealed in different groups around the world that Chinese people deserve a virus or receive what they claim to be a fair reward.
Some countries in Africa also have an increase in anti-Tycule sentiment.
Many of the people of Wibur and Hubei reported discrimination because of the origin of their area.
There's been support for the Chinese, whether ding or drying, and for people in the area that's covered with virus.
Following the development of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, Italians, the first country in Europe that has experienced serious COVID-19, can also be the target of suspicion and xenofbiia. People in the countries involving Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea at first signed a petition to ban the Chinese into their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, Tagar #ChineseDontCometoJpan became an trend on Twitter.
Chinese people and other Asians in Britain and the United States reported an increase in racist abuse and assault rates.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the crownvirus as "Virus Chinak", the term that critics consider racist and anti-Tiocule.
The signers in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and strangers being evacuated from Wvi Sanztary to Novi Sanzary.
Students from East India, bordering with China, and learning in the big cities of India were reportedly affected by a coronal outbreak abuse.
The President of the B.C.A.ya Janata state unit at the West Didasla Ghosh said that China had ruined the natural world and "that's why God took vengeance on them."
That statement was then condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, by calling it "serious". In China, xenophobia and racist against non-Tionghoa's non-Tionghoa left by the desert, with the strangers described as "sampt" and set to "st free".
A lot of newspapers using a fee have removed it for some or all of their coronary lips.
Many scientific publishers have made the science related to the plague available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share the results quickly on the servers, like bioRxiv.

The lab tests for coronary mental disease 2019 (COVID) and SARS-CoV-2 virus involves methods that detect the existence of viruses and detect those antibodis that are produced as response to infection.
The virus's existence in a sample confirmed by RT-PR, which detects Grandvirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This test is used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibodi infection can be used for diagnosis and population survey.
Antibodi tests show the number of infected people, including those whose symptoms are too light to report or without symptoms.
The mortality number of accurate diseases and immune levels of the population can be determined by the results of this test.
Because of limited testing, until March 20, 2020, no country has a local data about the prevalence of virus in its population.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there's a big variation in the number of tests that have been made by countries.
This diversity may also have significant effects on the fatality of reported cases, which is likely to be counted too high in some countries.
Using polymerase chain reaction to real-time transition (rRT-PCR), this test can be done on breathing samples that are acquired with various methods, including nasopharing or sputum samples.
Mostly, results are available in just a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test that was done on the throat is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
In time, the virus can disappear in the throat while it keeps spraying in the lungs.
As an alternative, for the infected person who was tested on the second week, sample material can be taken from deep - breathing channels by using ceteter isap or materials released through coughs can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the reaction of polymerase transprecisations real-time transscription (rRT-PCR), and forming at least 250,000 tests to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Britain also developed testing on January 23, 2020. The South Korea industry developed the SARS-CoV-2 detecting device based on the PCCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) of January 28, 2020.
This device is looking for the "E" gene that has all of the total malvirus, and gene RdRp specifically for SARS-CoV-2. In China, ERI Group is one of the first company to accept emergency use of the U.S.A.A. of the European Medical Medical Administration for the SARS-CoV-2-C. in the United States and Control Centers.
One of the three genetic tests in an ancient version test device gives no assurance of a reagen error, and the amount of testing in the CC is limited in Atlanta; it resulted in an average of 100 samples a day successfully processed during February 2020.
Tests using two components are considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and then the state lab and local lab are allowed to test.
This test was approved by the U.S. Drug and Food Organization based on emergency Use. The U.S. commercial lab began testing early in March 2020.
March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the CIVID test tests available based on RT-PR on national scale.
In the same way, A Diagnos Adnotic Quest made the CIVID-19 national test available on March 9, 2020.
There's no displaying limit; gathering and processing of specimens must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the Virology and Biology Center of VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for the Surveils on Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed tests to detect COVID 2420 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diignostats received approval to test that could be done in four hours with high volume so that one machine could perform some 4.1 hours.
On March 19, 2020, theperilization of emergency use (EU.S.) was issued to Abbott Labourturries to test at the m20 Abbott system; the previously issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientist.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an ECUL from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has agreed to test that uses analyphilating isoteric acid tissue that is not PCR.
Because it doesn't need a series of temperature change patterns, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are now about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipated to improve production until producing 50,000 tests a day. Tests that use monocal antibodi monocalal proteins that specifically bind kleokacid (prote N) new crowns are being developed in Taiwan, with hope can give results in 15 to 20 minutes like a quick test.
A library survey published in March 2020 concluded that "the sext photo has a small diagnosis value at the start, as well as a CT finding [commoography] may already exist before the show of symptoms."
The typical feature on CT includes ground-glass multilobes otherwise timed with peripheral distribution, asymetri, and posterior.
Subpleura domination, crazy naving, and consoles are formed as a result of the development of disease.
At Wurb, a study that compares PCR with CT at the present end of the academy shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many features of retroductation features associated with pneumnia and other diseases.
In March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as the first test in the COVID-century diagnosis." In March 20,20, the CDC recommended PC for initial filtering.
Part of the immune response to infection is an antibodi formation that includes IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals since about 7 days after awitan symptoms, to determine the immune to the disease, and in the population survey. The testing can be done in the center lab (CLT) or with testing points-ofcare (POCT).
The automatic system with high results in many clinical labs will be able to do this check, but the supply will depend on the production levels for each system.
For CLT, it is commonly used as a perustic blood specimen, even though a series of specimens can be used to follow an immune response.
For PoCT, it is commonly used as one peripheric blood specimen through skin stabs.
Unlike the PCR method, extract step is not necessary before the inspection. On March 26, 20,20, thepers mentioned 29 institutions that provide notice to agencies as necessary and that can now distribute their antibodi tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA based on emergency use. On March 20, 2020, Euroimmun Medical Labostourary Diostatics and Epitope Diagnotics had his approval for their testing device that could detect antibodi IgG and IgA against the virus in the blood.
The testing capacity to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than the conventional PCR check on the virus.
The Antibodi was usually detected 14 days after the awitan of infection, in early April, Britain found that not one of the antibodi tests he bought was good enough to use.
Hong Kong set up a schedule for expected patients to stay at home, "departement emergency would give the patient a specimen tube," they would spit it back into it, sent it back, and get the test results in a few moments later. The NHS English announces that NHS is pioneering on a recent test scheme in the home so that if they come to the hospital or have to demonstrate an ambulance if the test is being used for an unexpected COVID case, a professional health will take the test.
The stage of testing has helped South Korea to perform the fastest and most expensive testing of any country.
The cost is served by health insurance if a doctor's test is asked.
According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 16,000 tests a week.
On March 19, violent trials were offered in some large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown because only positive results reported.
A first lab survey revealed that, in all, 483.25 samples have been tested until and including a 12/2020 week and 33.491 samples, positive exhibits for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Hospital and Rambamba have been tested and tested methods to test tests tests of 64 patients together, and just to test more cases if they are found positive.
With its construction being watched by the founder of Wang Jian and taking 5 days and taking advantage of 5 days, it shows that the case in Hubei can be 47% higher and the cost is related to quarantine management could be twice as much if this test capacity did not exist.
The Wurtu lab was soon followed by Huo-Yan lab at Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in all 12 cities throughout China.
On March 4, 2020, the total capacity of a day's daily capacity is about 50,000 tests. The multiple open sources are released by Origami Assays can test as much as 1,222 patients for use only 93 checks. This balanced design can be run in a small lab without the need of artificial fluids.
Until March, the lack and the amount of reagens have become a struggle for mass testing in the European Union, Britain, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are trying to explore the sample-specific protocols that involve sample warming at 98 °C (08 °F) for five minutes to take off RNA genes for further testing. In March 31, the Arab Union was reported to have more countless vellighal tests of the population than any country, and are ready to increase the scale of testing for most of the population.
It is achieved through the combination of screen testing and lab purchases mass produced as the population of 42 Group and NGI (in the "Huo-Yan" device lab in China).
As built in 14 days, this lab is able to do tens of thousands of RT-PR tests a day and is the first lab to have this scale outside China.
It is a prescription for testing that targets various parts of the progenitoral profiles developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German recipe for the production of test tools sent to low - production countries without resources to develop itself.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Center was not available until January 28 in order to reduce the testing available in the United States.
On the other hand, experts say that large testing methods in South Korea help reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
Test capacity, mostly in private sector labs, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for the increase in testing programs as the best way to slow down the KIVID imp. A high request for testing by the spread of the virus led to hundreds of thousands of testing in U.S. private labs, and the supply of users and chemical reagens was critical.
In March 20,20, China, reported the problem of interrogation on their test tools.
In the United States, the test tools developed by the CDC have "cat"; the government then removed the scruples that prevent private testing. Spain buys tests from the Chinese company of Shenzhen Biechnchology Co Ltd, but found that the result was not accurate.
The company explained that false results may lead to failure to collect samples or to use test tools correctly.
The Spanish administration says that they're going to pull the equipment that gives not true, and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bio.80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic of China. Slovakia bought 1.2 million tests from China turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovč suggests that this test device was thrown into Danube River. Ateş Kara of Turkish Health says that Turkish test tools bought from China have "a high fault" and they didn't "use it". Inggris Raya bought a million tests from China, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that the test device could not be used.
The tests, followed by positive quarantines and the tracking of people with positive SARS-CoV-2 people, gave a positive ending.
A check that works in the Italian city of Vò, the first death site due to COVID-19 in Italy, has two rounds of testing on all populations made up of 3,400 people, at a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the positive people have no symptoms, and all the cases found in quarantine.
With the restrictions of travel to this community, new infection is eliminated completely.
With aggressive contact tracking, incoming restrictions, trial, and quarantine, Grandvirus 2020 in Singapore has grown much slower than other developed countries without extreme restraints, such as a blinding of restaurants and recluses.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that the people live in the house on March 28, but the schools were opened on time after the holidays on March 23th.
Some other countries also handle path controls with aggressive contact tracking, incoming restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with non-strengthing regions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A study of statistics found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a far lower number of fatalities, perhaps because these countries are more capable of detecting people who have mild or without symptoms.
WHO recommend that countries that have no testing capacity, and national labs with limited COVID experience, send five first positive samples and ten first negative samples to one of the 16 indexs to test tests.
Of 16 labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "%s positive results" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
The country that only tests people in the hospital will have % more positive results than countries that test all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors.
Washing hands, also called hand - cleaning, is the act of cleansing one’s hands that is intended to remove shit, oil, microorganism, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain “critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many illnesses, such as diare and colera, which is transmitted through a fecal-oral route.
People can also be infected with respiratory disease, such as disease or cold, if they don't wash their hands before touching the eye, nose, or mouth.
Five critical times during a very important day to wash your hands with soap are: before and after dumping large water, after cleaning the child’s ass or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before preparing food or running meat, fish, or raw purple.
If water and soap don't exist, hands can be cleaned up with ashes, the World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning out a kid who just used a toilet.
After cleaning the nose, cough, or water.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical cleaning refers to the practice of hygiene associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical goal of washing hands is cleaning hands from pathogens, viruses, or other microorganism that can cause disease, and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in medical areas, but it is also a practice that is important to the public.
Washing hands has a lot of health benefits, including reducing the spread of disease, the coronary virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of contagious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality of the baby at home.
The study done in 2013 revealed that the increase in the practice of washing the hands can raise the high growth of the young.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children from respiratory disease can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate of the disease to nearly 50%.
The intervention that encourages the washing can reduce the case of a third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low - production areas.
48% of the demented case can be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent chere and acute respiratory infections, as unconscious behavior done at home, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the principal ISPA, is the cause of the number one child death; this disease causes the death of about one million children a year.
Diare and pneumonia cause death nearly 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, making your hands wash with soap before eating and after using toilets can save more lives over vaccines or any medical action, and reducing death to nearly half of it and the death of the disease infection of a quarter.
Washing hands are usually combined with other sanitation acts as part of the water program, sanitation, and hygiene.
Washing hands also protects themselves from the effects of direct physical contact.
The small side effects of washing hands are often done to cause skin damage due to skin drying.
The test that was done in 2012 in Denmark found that washing overstimulated hands can cause physical and psychological conditions, known as hand or cosmetics, which especially occur among health officers.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsession-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical days of washing hands with soap when it is important to reduce physical diseases: before and after using the toilet (respons, dumping water, large water), after cleaning the child's ass, before feeding a child, before eating and before preparing food or preparing meat, fish, or raw ones.
Another important time to apply the proper washing techniques to prevent the transmission of disease is before and after taking care of the wounds; after it has been covered, coughs, or noses; after touching animal wastes or handling animals; and after touching refuse.
In many lands, washing hands with soap is still low.
A study of washing hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average 38 percent of the houses were doing laundry by soap.
Mendar Health Care Program applied by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of a time - tested action in support of child health and education.
A worm drug twice a year, plus a wash of hands every day with soap and brush your teeth every day with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program was also successfully applied in Indonesia.
The microorganism cleansing of the skin is backed up by soaping or depreciation into the water.
The main work of soap and deteration is to reduce obstacles to solution and increase late energy.
The water is just an efficient skin cleaning because of fat and protein, which is an organic waste component, it's not easy to get out of water.
Even so, cleaning fat and protein is helped by a sufficient stream of water.
The solid rate, because its ability to reuse, may contain bacteria that were obtained from earlier use.
A small number of studies that study bacteria ’ transfers from solid soap conclude that transfers cannot occur because bacteria are used as a bass.
Even so, the CDC continues to say, "The drop of a liquid drop from a vessel without being touched more like it."
The antibirths are greatly encouraged to people who are well aware of health.
Until now, there has not been any evidence that the use of antipsytics or the synthetics that are recommended better for organisms that survive antibiotics in nature.
However, antibakteri soap contains a common antibakary agent such as tricks, which has a list of powerful organisms.
So, even though antibiotic extracts are not targeted by antibiotic soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is.
In addition to pfaktant and skin protective substances, sophisticated formulation can contain acid (austic acid, acorat acid, la palabrakactic acid) as pH, serzothic acid as active antiicroba, and more skin clots (i.e.s, vitamins, bites, extratation).
Warm water to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteri grows faster in body temperature (37 °C).
Warm water is more effective than with cold water in removing natural oil that holds away shit and bacteria.
However, behind many people’s convictions, scientific studies show that warm water use has no effect on reducing microbial numbers in hand.
Hands or hand anti-optication is a clean-up agent with no water-based cleaner.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the hand-serving agent of an unleagued alcohol-based alcoholic (also called an alcoholic-based hand driver, an anti-septic driver, or hand-servation) began to be known.
Most of these clean-up agents are based on alcohol inoprocess or intanols that are combined with information like Carboomer (polymer acidic acid) to be gacter or with glycerins like glycerin to be used and to reduce the effects of alcohol.
The supply of hydrogen peripheral peroxide increases further antimicroba activity, an intervention that contains at least 60-5% alcohol is an efficient mite killer.
Pulse alcohol poisoning kills bacteria, bacteria that survive a lot of drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, multiple viruses (ver HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovus, rccinus, vaccinia, vasinza, and hips), and mushrooms.
The alcoholnitation that contains 70% of alcohol kills 99.9 decibels, similar to that of 35 debel bacteria in 30 seconds after use and 99,99% to 99,999% (consolations 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands of one minute after the use. The most effective handing of bacteria and less effective on several viruses.
The alcohol - based intervention of nearly all alcohol - based hands have to do with nonrovirus virus (or Norwallic), the most common cause for infectious gases. Antisiperious hands or alcohol users in enough amount should be used to heat or cover two hands completely.
The front and back of two hands and in the colla and the end of all the fingers were ripped about 30 seconds to fluid, foam, or dry gel.
The fingers must also be washed well by brushing them on two lines of hand, the U.S. Centers of Control and Prevention are more advised to wash their hands instead of a stringed hand, especially when the hand looks dirty.
Intensing the use of resuscitation agents because of the ease of use and quick killing activity of microorganism; however, constipation agents should not be used as the replacement of the correct hands, except soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol - based coiling can often cause dry skin, unless it's emolyen and/or skin softening added to the formula.
The effects of drying from alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other emolien to formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol - based hand mutilations that contain emolylen cause irritation and skin droughts are much lower than soap and antimicroba deteration.
Introductive contact contact contact, contact utric syndrome, or hypersensia towards alcohol or substance in alcohol watchers rarely occur.
A lower spirit causes disturbing contact to be the appeal of this product than washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't clear their hands from organic matter, but just infect them.
For this reason, the cleaning of hands is not as effective as soap and water as preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still on hand.
The diversity of alcohol - free hands is very dependent on its materials and shapes, and according to history, this product is in a significant way worse than alcohol and alcohol abuse.
Recently, the formulation that uses cerozalcide coride has proved to have ongoing and progressive antimicroba activity after the use, not like alcohol, which has proved to be reduced after repeated use, perhaps due to progressive side effects.
Many in low - paying communities could not afford soap and use ashes or dirt instead.
Abu or land may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the worries is, if contaminated with microorganism, land or ashes would probably increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ashes are also agents of deinfectant because, if contact with water, ashes will form an alkaline.
WHO recommends ashes and sand as alternative soap when soap is not available.
The correct washing technique based on the U.S. Disease Control Center for disease control prevention includes the following steps:
With warm water or cold water.
Water flows in demand because the hidden coils may be contaminated, while the temperature of water does not seem to have any effect.
Hands will rub it with plenty of soap, including hand backs, in fingers, and under nails.
Sabun lifts brush from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more closely when using soap than when they use water alone.
For at least 20 seconds.
Squeezeing into a scratch, which helps remove the skin from the skin, and rub it out longer.
A careful amount of water under the flow.
It's in the bowls can make the hand contaminated again.
Dry with dry magic or let it dry in the air.
Wet hands and spinbabs are easier to re-inspriminated: the area that often goes missing is thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers, and under nails.
The artificial nails and the memoryless nails can save microorganism.
The wheels are often recommended to keep hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
The choice of low - scale options can be made to exploit your hands when water is not available and/or soap is not available, for example, pouring water from a drop or a stumbling bottle and in a hole and/or using ashes, if necessary, in the developing country. In situations when supplying the limited water (like schools or rural areas in the country), there are water solutions, such as "tun-pace", and other options are low.
The tippy is a simple technology that uses a water bottle hung with ropes, cuffs that are operated by feet to pour some water into their hands, and a soap.
Effective handing is an important part of the process of cleaning, but there is a debate about the most effective form of handing in the general toilet.
The more studies show that paper laps are far cleaner than electrical dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008 a study was conducted by Westminster University, London, and was sponsored by the modern - day industrial European European Symposium paper industry, to compare the level of paper magic hygiene, warm - air dryer, and jet-serving.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, the total number of bacteria found increased at 1.4% in fingers and 254% in the palm of the hand.
Breathing with jet dryer causes a total number of bacteria average 42% in fingers and 15% in the palm of the hand.
After washing and drying your hands with paper magic, the total number of bacteria is less than 76% in fingers and 77% in the palm of your hand. Illmuwan also test to determine the potential of cross-dination on other toilet users and toilet environments as a result of each type of drying methods.
The jet air filter, which leaks air from a unit at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/hour), is capable of blowing microorganism from hand and unit and potentially defiling other toilet users and toilet environments up to six feet [2 m].
The use of warm air-servings spread microorganism to 0.25 feet from the dryer.
Paper rate shows no significant microorganism. In 2005, in a study by T.N.V.produt und Umwet, various methods of handing are reviewed.
After hand drying, the next number of bacteria is observed:
There's a lot of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to the drying by using a paper spell.
Washing hands by using hand - mutilations is an alternative during a journey if there are no soap and water.
The alcohol - based hand mutilation must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical treatment was required far after Hungarian physicist Igaz Semmelweis discovered his effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There's an electronic device that provides bait to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection levels are down with the use of the device.
Medical cleaning was done for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in a number of or gels to turn and rub every piece of hand.
Hands have to be ripped together with the fingers of each other.
If there's dirt under the nails, the fur brush can be used to remove it.
Because I can survive in the water that is in the hands, the hands need to be carefully painted and dried with clean magic.
After dry, paper laps are used to turn off the water (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids recontamination of the surface.
The purpose of washing hands in health care is to remove the microorganism of pathogens.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the lack of brainwashing is still at levels that cannot be accepted in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forget how to wash their hands before touching a patient so that it infects microorganism.
One study shows that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can lower the level of blood infection linked to 66 percent.
The concept of cleanliness of WHO's hand can also be seen on its web site for public comments.
The relevant review was done by Whitby et al.
A commercial device can measure and clean hands and clean hands if a demonstration of obedience to the rules is needed.
The World Health Organization has the time to wash the hands:
Once it's stuck to blood/ body fluid
Before the task is accepted, and
After patient treatment. The supply of anti-septic chemicals to soap, or "tanicroba" works to kill the laundry material.
The murder function may be desired before performing a surgeon or in the situation when an organism that holds antibiotics is very common. For 'to move' hand before surgery, it is needed to turn off and shut down without touching, chorphyxidins or yodium, model to dry your hands after washing, and sterilize it to dry up and clean under my skin.
All jewelry must be released.
This procedure's allowed to wash hands and arms down to the elbows, usually 2–6 minutes.
A long hour of harassment is not necessary.
When it turns, the water in the bottom of the arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After we had finished washing our hands, hands were dried up in crushed cloths and had been put on a surgical garment.
To reduce translation, it is better to wash your hands or to use hand - awareness before and after handling sick people.
For a staff infection control at the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands came from the first 20% of cleaning, and that an additional benefit that was obtained is very little when hand - cleaning frequency increased over 35%.
Consuming with soap is more than three times as much as 30 seconds as the transmission of infection to food than washing with anti-baker soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than the alcohol - based hands to reduce the alcohol - based virus of A H1N1 and the Clostridium of hand. Intervenary to improve hands in health care can involve education for the staff in washing, improving alcohol - based hand - based hands supplies, and writing reminders to staff.
More research is required to know the most effective interventions in various health - care settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a fundamental way that costs good health and even good nutrition.
Yet, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or laundry facilities in residents’s homes, schools, and places of work makes the target a challenge to the behavior of universal washing hands.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, the washing area near private toilets or public toilets is rarely available, although there is an option to make a cheap laundry site.
In any case, the low level of laundry can also happen because of a custom that has been developed and not because of a lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and encouragement to wash your hands with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and produce long - term behavior changes.
To be effective, surveillance and evaluation required.
A systemic review of 70 studies found that an effective community-based approach to boosting hands in LMC, while a social marketing campaign is not effective. One example of washing hands at school is "Producing Three Stars" by UNICEF which motivates the school to take simple and cheap steps to make sure students wash their hands with soap, between other standards of cleanliness.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one star to finally to three stars.
Building hands can be part of a washing campaign that is done to reduce children’s disease and death.
The day of the World’s Hands is another example of an increased awareness campaign that tries to achieve behavioral change, as a result of a 2020-20th [192020] virus’s congratulation, UNICEF encourages the use of an emojiding of the hand.
Some studies examine the cost of washing their hands completely in developing countries in connection with the Disability-adjusted Life Year or the size of the year lost by pain.
One survey suggests that encouraging your hands to wash with soap significantly more costs than water intervention and other sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as new birth mothers or soldiers who were injured in the hospital, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two hand - cleaners: doctors Hungarian Igriaz Segmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, who were first known in the middle of modern times in England.
At that time, many still believe that infection was caused by a foul smell called a miasma or a bad air.
In the 1980s, an outbreak that was transmitted through food and infection that was associated with health care made the U.S. Control and Prevention of the United States’s Diseases more actively driven by hand to prevent the spread of infection.
The Canal flu dome in 2009 and COVID-19 pandemia in 2020 increased awareness in many countries will be the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from the infectious disease.
For example, posters "stunnal washing the right hands" were hung next to the sink sinks in the public toilet and in the toilets of the office and the airport in Germany.
The expression "handening from" means stating one's reluctance to be responsible for something or to get involved in something.
The expression comes from the Bible chapter of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to dishonor Jesus Christ, but it has been an expression that is widely used in the British community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth started washing her hands constantly to clean the imajiner stain; an act that shows her guilt for the crime that she did and because she had persuaded her husband to do it.
It has also been found that once you have recalled or meditated on unpleasant actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate the equipment to wash their hands.
Furthermore, those left to wash their hands after the meditation had smaller mogs involved in the "surging," as volunteer.
Religion commands washing hands for clean and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, using water, but without soap to wash their hands, is part of the ritual washing hands in many religions, including the Bahá'í, Hindu trust, the tevilah and the net of yalabo in Jews, Lavabo in Islam.
Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim religions are obliged to wash their hands after using toilets.
Also, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims are required to wash their hands before and after eating.
The danger control of work for COVID-19
The risk control of work for COVID-19 is a safety pathological application of health and working health control for the prevention of coronalviral disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The right danger control at work depends on the location of work and job work, which is based on the risk measure of paparan, the rate of disease in the community, and the risk of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to U.S. Safety Administration and Work Health, low - risk jobs have minimum work contact with public and other workers; for this job, recommended basic infections, which include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay in the home if they are ill, breathing ethics, and doing a routine cleaning and caring for the environment.
The risk of exposure is involved in a work that requires close contact or often with an unknown person who is expected to suffer from an LOVID-19, but it may be infected because of transmission in an ongoing society or international travel.
This group included workers who have contact with public people like in school, environments with high population ties, and high volume order.
The danger control for this group, apart from basic infection precautions, involves ventilation using high-descient air filters, protective against the water, and providing protection when meeting with the COVID-19.
OSHA considers the health and morgue that is located on someone who is known or expected to suffer a high LOVID risk of exposure, which is a growing risk if workers perform aerosing procedure on, or take or handle specimens of, people who are known or suspected to suffer from COVID-19.
The proper danger control for this worker includes technique control, such as a negative ventilation room, and the self - protection tools that fit the job.
The COVID-19 plague can have some impact on the workplace.
The worker may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or because of fear of exposure.
Business pattern can change, either in the kind of thing requested or how to get these things (like shopping outside the busy hours, by delivery, or in the frame).
In the end, delivering items from the highly personal area of the COVID-19 could be interrupted.
The plan considers the risk levels related to different workplaces and jobs, including the sources of exposure, the risk factors raised from home fathers and society, and the risks of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also describes the control that is needed to deal with the risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Kesiapsagaan and plans of infectious diseases may submit to national or social recommendation.
The purpose of the outbreak includes reducing the transmission among staff, protecting people who are at greater risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing bad effects on other intities in the supply chain.
The intensity of the disease in the community where business is affecting the actions of repeated recursion taken.
The danger control shark is a labor shell that is used in safety and working health to combine danger control based on its effectiveness.
If COVID-19 danger is unresponsible, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative management, and the last protective tool.
Technically control includes isolationing employees from work - related dangers without relying on the working behavior and becoming the most efficient solution of the cost to be applied.
administrative management is a change in job policy or procedures that require both workers or employers.
Self - protection tools (APD) are considered less effective than technique and administrative controls, but they can help prevent most fathers.
All types of APD should be selected based on the danger of workers, installed properly as they do (empirator, resirators), are regularly and properly, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and removed.
According to U.S. Safety Administration and Work Health, low - risk jobs have minimum work contact with public and other employees.
The steps of basic infection that are recommended for all places, including often washing their hands thoroughly, encourages workers to stay in the home if they are sick, breathing ethics include covering rocks and water, providing tissues and garbage containers, preparing for work from distance or time to time with arrivals, if necessary, to give workers no use and equipment, and to clean up and clean up the environment regularly.
The quick and isolated identification of potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay home until they are free from fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using a fever or other symptoms controler drug, and that the hospital health policy may allow employees to stay at home to care for the hospital, and that the employees will know this policy.
According to OSHA, the risky job is to include a job that needs close contact or often within six feet (1.8 m) with an unknown person who is expected to suffer from COVID-CoV-2, but it may be infected with social transmissions around business locations, or because someone new has traveled internationally to the area with a vast COVID transmission.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general society such as in school, working with high - population ties, and field quel volume settings. The technique for this group and a high risk group included setting up high air filters, increasing ventilation levels, setting up a physical barrier, such as the physical barrier in school, and setting up a drive-thru or setting for the field service field service. The field controls of this group is a high - risk of working in the home, which includes replacing the highly timeline of communication, increasing the body’s of support, the support, the support, the support of the support of the support, the support, and support of the support of the support, the support of the support of the support, and support of the support of the support of the support, the support of the support of the support of the support, and assistance of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support, of the support, the support, of the support of the support, and support, of the support, of the support, of the support, the support of the support, of the support, the support, of the support, of the support, and the support, of the support, the support, of the support, of the support, of the support, the support of the support of the support, of the support of the support, of the support, of the support, of the support of the support of the support of the support, of the support of the support of the support, of the support, of the support, of the support, and of the support, of the support of the support of the support, of the support, of the support, and of the support, and of the support of the support, and the support, and of the support of the support, and of the support, of the support, and of the support, of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support, and of the support, of the support of the support of the support, of the support, of the support, of the support, of the support of the support, and of the support, and of the support of the support, and of the support, of the support, of the support, and of the support, and of the support, of the support, of the support, of the support, of the support of the support, and of the support, of the support, and of the support, of the support, of the support, of the support, of the support of the office operation of others ins, of the support, of the support, and of the support of the support, of the support, and of the support, of the support, of the office operation of others..
The workers in this risk group do not need respirators.
If someone gets sick on a plane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers involves separating people who are sick by six feet, pointing one cabin crew to look after the sick, and offering the masks for the sick or asking him to close their mouth and noses with the tissue when the cough or the stone.
You cabins have to wear the medical gloves when taking care of sick passengers or touching body fluids or the potentially contaminated surface and maybe other protective devices if a sick passenger has a fever, a constant cough, or a breathing problem.
The gloves and other goods have to be thrown into a life bag, and the contaminated surface must be cleaned up and infected after. For a commercial voyage, including fishing ships and other passengers, danger control involves delaying the journey if it is ill, disserving the medical center of the ship, and witnessing the medical center immediately if one has a fever or other symptoms on the ship.
Idealally, medical studies were performed in a isolated cabin, no matter how much of the community, for school and child care facility, CDC recommends short-term closings to clean or commit infected if people who were infected were at school.
If the transmission in society at the minimum level to the present, social restraint strategy can apply, which includes: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating in cafeteria, increasing distance between the table, the arrivals, and a gradual return, restricting absence visitors, and using separate health locations for children with symptoms similar to the flu.
If there is a high transmission in the local community, along with social restraint strategy, the extension of school will be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, the health risks are considered low by the CDC.
A law enforcement officer who has to make contact with the confirmed or unexpected COVID-19 recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-servators.
If close contact occurs during the arrest, workers have to clean up and treat their belts and task equipment before being used again by a spray or household cleaner and then follow standard operating procedures to control and take out a former APD and to control and wash dirty clothes.
SOHA considers the health and body energy to be in the category of high or extremely high risk.
High - risk work includes health care, support, labs, and medical transportation that is diagnosed with known or expected COVID-19 patients.
This job is a high risk if workers perform aerosol procedure on, or take or handle specimens from, known or expected COVID-19.
Aerosol procedure includes intration, rock breeding procedure, bronkoccop, several procedures and tooth checks, or accematory specimen.
The duty of the morgue is at risk of the work of the workers involved in preparing a dead man who is known or expected to be a CVID-man case at death; this job is a very high risk if workers perform autosips. Additional techniques for this risk group include the isolation of patients who are known or suspected of COVID-imology, including when the reseration procedure is performed.
Special negative pressure poisoning may be appropriate in some health - care settings and morgues.
The scheme must be handled with levelel's safety precaution 3th.
The World Health Organization (WO) recommends that patients who come to be separated into a different waiting room based on whether they are thought to be a COVID-century case. In addition, OPA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of known or expectedly infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform social performance.
In the United States, the N95-face cover respirator approved NIOSH or better should be used in the context of written respiratory protection programs that include appropriate tests, training, and medical examinations.
Another kind of respirator can provide a greater protection and increase the comfort of workers. WHO does not recommend the total cover or every coat because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO is just recommending surgical masks for the screening officer at the entrance point.
For those who take respiratory specimens, take care, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, clothing, and gloves.
If aerosol procedure is performed, the surgeon is replaced with N95 respirator or FFP2.
Given that APD supply is not enough throughout the world, WHO recommends the need for an APD through long - term medical services, physical restrictions like a window of perspective, with only people involved in immediate treatment may enter a room containing COVID region patients, using only APD needed for a specific task, keep using the same respirators without taking care of many patients with the same perceptions, and monitoring the same airlines, and editing the air chain of the AP, and no longer, and no longer, for any other symptoms.

BARIS SUBJEK: [WId-19] Refreshing burden and preparing the future
TANGGAL/DEVER: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
REITS: CC0: No rights to protect
We find ourselves in such a wonderful situation this month.
The COVID-19 Epid was the thing that makes clear the inter-human status and the responsibility that we have each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and global community construction, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've witnessed among all fellow workers through emails, calls, and chats are incredible eyewitnesses of human beings, which we've been lucky enough to work with them.
My gratitude and pride can't be referred to as fellow workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how much it means to the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how this is a strong symbol for this important resource to remain available to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you keep the site running, help pay for our colleagues, or help keep the security of our community.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially right now.
It's a moment when it's not just the work we do, but the way we do it will make the impact that the world has.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjusting to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenge we faced and the best way to keep the survival of the organization all these days.
We really want to lose the pressure and support our mission for a long term.
If you need to reduce the job schedule, it's okay.
For all staffs, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, to further notice.
We don't set off a day off, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
But the world cannot be interpreted right now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shopping for a tree, or going to a doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your worktime.
If you're sick, don't work.
It's not supposed to be said, but we're saying it.
It's not necessary or PTO, enough to inform your manager and help your team see the calendar and schedule to ensure the main field of work can be completed.
(If you're diagnosed positiveally ill, please tell Bryan in T onps so that T onC can help with support and make sure your situation gets the right attention of management.)
The mate whose pay is due hour-based will be paid full.
We've said it, and said it one more time, to honor our commitment to the contractors and the clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal hours of work.
It includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of channeling stress on the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Again, the main thing is to look after yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what needs to be anticipated and can take appropriate action.
A certain job is considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, Operation SDM, Trust & Security, as well as the Dana union, among other things, doing important work that may need additional support.
We're going to start a process with all the departments to judge the current purpose and distract our focus to support the essentials for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential project.
Slowing down at this moment won't be anything for the future.
We're not planning on running a late end of this academy.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet the current unrealistic time limit.
We realized that situations changed and would try to set new targets and lines if necessary.
What about APP?
To adapt to new reality and awareness of the day’s work hours, we intend to adjust the time line for the completion of the 20202202th Yearbook plan.
We mean to propose a 20-20-20 series that allows more time to make budgets so that employees can raise an important job, self - care care, and the care of the loved ones while training them in their needs or wanting to work on schedule for less than a few weeks to come up.
This length of time has been greatly reduced by work and planning pressure now all over the organization.
We will deliver our proposal to the council next week and will update delegates and teams on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you APP team for your leadership in this matter.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our fellows based on SF may have been exposed to COVID-19 virus.
However, for deep concern, we hire cleaning crew to infect all surfaces in San Francisco's office.
They use the peripheral fluid of the hospital to infect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
The building applies its own safety ensure protocol by using a product that supports the safety of its provider.
We were glad that the office would be ready when we decided to return.
Our DC office is in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocols protocols to us and all of the staff based on DC.
From last week, our DC's office moved to a long- distanced work order, along with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As it was known by some of our friends who were based on the NYC, we were also discussing hiring the location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still continuing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work from a distance for the first time.
Our long-time associate realized that it may be necessary to make adjustments and they want to offer you some advice:
The limit of one or two-hour meeting lasts.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into a few days.
Deficate meeting clearly, for agendas, and send in the previous publications.
Make a video as default, with a device like Google Docs and Zoom to enhance the cooperation and direct connections.
Show the leaders to enhance each meeting, someone to monitor chats for questions and records a speaker list, and someone to help create a meeting note (or create a joint record).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy small foods.
Join the #remotis channel in Slack to talk to your partner about the job shared
The SDM operations team is looking for web - based ercogomis to support the increase in work distributed throughout the foundation.
Last week we asked all members of the community's funds to cancel Wikimedia's public event, like Edit-a-thon, until WHO declared the bread had ended.
We tell them that we understand our request for revocation and other restrictions can make them impossible to complete the approved supply and that no one will be given pinal to delay or modify the target.
The next week we'll follow up with an additional guide on Wikimania and a regional community conference and other themetics.
In general, the sentiment of the entire global community seems to be a sadness because of this disorder, but it is both relieved of clarity and the ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Next, CRT is trying to prepare a page in Met-Wiki to provide room for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll send you an invitation to your calendar for Thursday, at 14:00 p.m./07:00 PT to a meeting of a special staff.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and make time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all of the essential information related to another COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also tried to keep a routine communication with staff living in countries that are now significant.
If you have questions about travel, events, main work area, or difficulty about lips, or other things that may need help, do not hesitate to tell and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and become connected to needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judan, director of International Global SDM Operation.
No one of these changes is seen as our job fulfillment and duty.
Rather, these changes are a recognition that, at present, our jobs and obligations may need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are the steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can keep working, provide the support that we need, and give the world the services they're responsible for.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for the important work that will come in a couple of weeks and maybe a few months to come forward.
We need all of you to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work as well as you need it.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, feel V, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other People of the Congregation (Grann I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, M, and Toby).
b' Enzim dysin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell (cell cells) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity contrary to the enzyme of the dysin denzim (ACE), by reducing the number of surelytentensin-II and increasing Angiotensinsin (1-7), thus making it a promising target to treat the disease. ACE2 also serves as a point into a cell for some coronavirus.
ACE2 human versions are often called HACE2
The enzyme of Dynthecytensin 2 is a metaloenzim containing a septree that lies on the surface of edotel cells and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has the M2 peptide terminal-N domain and the amino re-fitrin terminal-C transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-type servile membrane protein I, with an enzyme that's active on the surface of the cell in the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 extrasel domain separated by other enzymes, known as sheddase, and the terriced protein was released into the blood stream and finally introduced into the urin.
ACE2 is in most of its organs: ACE2 attached to cell membrane mainly the lung alveolar form II, small intestine cells, artery cells and veins, and innocent muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mREN expression was also found in the sebral, striats, mortgages, and brain trunks.
ACE2 main function is as an ACE developer.
ACE broke up a dystensin hormone I became a fellowtensin II Bascontruction.
Finally, ACE2 cut off the amino ponlalanin terminal carbosils from 12thusin II (Aps-Varg-Val-Tor-Ile-Pe-PHOhe) acid and hydolissics to be the 12-7 vadilator (HAp-Ap-arg -Val-HOHOHOHHHH).
ACE2 can also split up a number of other contraceptions [des-arg9] -bradirin, applein, neurotensin, dinophine A, andghrelin.
ACE2 also arranged traffic between amino imino neutral SLC6A19 and involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmerbran protein, ACE2 functions as the main entry point in the cell for some coronalvirus, which includes HCCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (Virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID).
More specificly, the form of protein S1 on cheating or tons of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoSV2 with enzyme domain ACE2 on the surface of the cell leads to endotosis and translocing viruses and enzymes into edosom located in the cell.
This virus's entrance process also requires a thing of protein S by a vertease of TMPRS2 in the cell's park, which his cheater is currently being investigated as potential therapy.
However, many professional people and regulating bodies recommend continue to submit to standard studies inhibitor ACE and ARB.
A systemic review and metaalisis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "inhibitorship of ACE caused a significant reduction of 34% in pneumonia risk compared with control."
Further, "ACE's inhibitor use also lowers the risk of pneumia in patients who have a higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients suffer from stroke and have a heart failure.
The use of the ACE Inhibitor is also associated with the death rate associated with pneumonia, though the result is less powerful than the risk of the entire pneumonymia."
ACE2 humans are recombined (rhACE2) expected to be new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase lung hemodinics and uniting oxygen in the pig's childhood with acute respiratory syndrome.
Half-time in humans about 10 hours with a 30-minute job other than a 24-hour effect.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance of systemhibitor-angiotensin (inhibitor RA) classic or in a disease with the dulytensin II in the circulation of blood. Infus rhACE2 has been tested in a clinical test for acute respiratory disease.
b'Apritic COVID-1920 is a mobile software application designed to help contact contact tracking the Grandvirus 202020, which is the process of identifying the "confent" who may have been contact with a infected person.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which have official government support in some areas and jurisdiction.
Some working skeletons to build contact tracking applications have been developed.
The issue of questionable privacy, especially related to the system that is based on the tracking of the location of the application user's geography.
Alternatives that don't get into privacy include the use of Bluetooth signal to record the approach of the user with another cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would redemploy the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and the ISS operating system.
In China, Chinese governments, along with Alipay, have spread applications that allow citizens to check if they have been contacted with COVID-19.
This application was used in over 200 Chinese cities in Singapore, using applications called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local T.A., released as a source of open and delivered to the government. North Macedonia launched "Stop Korona!", an application based Bluetooth based on exposure to infected people and provided a quick response to health care.
This application was developed by the communications and Technology Center and Health Services.
Until April 14th 2020, the application is still waiting for Google Play Storm and Apple App Storme's approval.
On April 12, the government stated that contact tracking applications are being in further development stages and will be available to spread within weeks. similar applications are planned in Ireland and in France “StopCovid”.
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore TraceTogether applications and Blue Torace protocols. Russia means to introduce a geophenic application for patients who live in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure that they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Camborridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur in the application-based system, which involves fake positive and possible lack of effectiveness if the data taken limited applications on a small portion of the population alone.
To overcome concerns about the spread of the "cronavirus" application that is misleading or dangerous, Apple sets boundaries on the type of organization that can add affavirus related application to App Storm, which is restricted only for the "resmi" organization or who has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon are applying similar restrictions.
The privacy supporters are expressing their concern about mass survey applications using the coronavirus apps, especially about whether the survey infrastructure made to handle the coronavirus board will be stopped after the threat passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued a statement that calls for limitations in this kind of survey.
This organization states eight conditions on government projects:
surveys should be "in accordance with the law, necessary, and professional."
Initiating and surveys must have setting sun count;
data use must be restricted to the purpose of COVID-19;
security and anonymity data must be protected and proved protected by evidence;
The digital survey must avoid the increasing severity of discrimination and Marginalization;
Every data division with third party must be defined in laws;
there has to be protection against the abuse and rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
Partition means all "Productoral interests" are required, which includes community health experts and groups are equipped. The Chaos Computer Club (CC) and German Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) also issued a check list.
The proposed Google/Apple plan means to resolve the constant survey problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the device's operating system after it is no longer necessary.
Some countries use network-based location trackings, and not applications, so eliminate the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network - based tracking was approved.
The network - based solution that has access to raw location data has significant privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use central servers only for intercommunication (see below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used for contact tracking.
Instead of using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications through text messages to a potential infected person.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contact, the government also made the information available to the public, which is allowed with extensive change in information laws after MERS’s decline in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and web sites. Such countries as Germany consider using the system's system to keep privacy safe.
Until April 6th 2020, it's not released.
In April 7, 2020, more than a dozen privacy - protection contacts, such as using Bluetooth Lowgy (BLE), with a large number of research literature literature sets from at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of the experts are working on private social solutions, such as using Bluetoow Lergy (BLE), to record the approach of the user with another cell phone.
However, PEP-PPP-PPP is an effort that contains a coordinated and detectorized approach, former contact (TCN, previous called Genesis Contact Number, CEN), and Considering Prestrupulations to the DP-P-PP-PPPPPPPPPPT (DPPPPTDDDT), previous calls (T, previously called Genesis, CEN, CEN), and Considering SStructrucistationstationstationsatriatementationsion to a Social (C).
In this protocol, the identifyable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy group at MIT Labs developed Safe Paths, platforms to use a technique that protects privacy when collecting and using location or international data to track the COVID-19 spread.
This is based on the research of the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the epidec" released on March 2020.Upaya was a similar safety platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and originally established at MlT Labs.
SafeTrace uses safe hardware technology to allow users to share the location and health data sensitive to other users and officers without sacrificing the privacy of the data.
On April 5, 2020, the Coalition of global TCNs was established by groups that have a basic approach and are a broad-up protocol, with the purpose of reducing fragation and allowing global interaction for tracking applications and warnings, which is a major aspect of reaching large acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made Blue Torace protocols used by its official government applications to be an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and ISO mobile platforms, announce the initiative for contact tracking, which they claim to protect privacy, based on the combination of Bluetooth LowEnergy technology and the culpography that protects privacy.
They also duplicate the core technology specification used in that system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to launch in three stages:
Tool launch to allow the government to create an official recognition application of the crownvirus that protects privacy
The combination of these functions directly to the ISOs and Android Google and Apple plans to resolve the problem of taking data and surveys constantly to distribute the system through the operating system's update, and then remove it in the same way after the threat passes.

Five vaccinary candidates are currently in Fase I's security study in April.
COVID19 identified on December 2019.
The great plague spread across the world in 2020, resulting in investment and great research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use a gene that is published to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI’s logic gave a statement in April that what should be noticed in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, preaching on a scale needed, and global access.
In April, the CEPI nurse reported that 10 different tech platforms were in research and development at the beginning of 2020 to make effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform target that's forward to the Fase I security study, covered:
nukleth acid (DNA and RNA) (pengeue I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mER-1273)
Vektor virus (Penge developer Fase I and vaccine candidate: Cans Sisno Biologics, voekorvirus type 5)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, total 115 vaccine candidates are in early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to the Milken Institute), and the other 37 were announced, but with a little public information available (in planning or under design).
Fase I-ll test the original security and immune evidence, usually randomly, controlled plasebo, and in some places, while determining more effective doses of doses.
Fase III's test usually involves more participants, including control groups, and testing vaccine effects to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects on optimum doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (persisted at early April 2020), 74 of whom are not yet in human evaluation (in the research "practinis").

In March 20, 2020, government, industry, and three U.S. universitys gathered resources to access supercomputer from IBM, combined with cloud-computation resources of Heckard pledges, Amazons, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterolog effects, which are also called nonspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond his preventing disease.
Further research tests in Australia are trying to run 4.2 health officers.
There's a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
The early study of vaccines uses a 3-term bio-trological model, such as the ACE2-transgenic mouse, other lab animals, and nonhuman primates, showing the need for reveling steps to achieve biological safety levels in handling the virus of living, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaksin against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
Until 2020, there's not been any protective drugs or vaccine for SARS that proved safe and effective on humans.
According to this, research published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for government and public health institutions all over the world.
When MERS became a prevalent, the research of the SARS that is believed to be a useful template to develop vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine that completes the molecular test IVS-GamVa, and the other three vaccines are in the process, which is all virus-vectors, two multi-vecroviral vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERSS).
The social media posts are covering the conspiracy theory that claims the virus behind COVID-19 has been known earlier and that vaccines have been available.
The Pattens quoted by various social media posts refer to the support available for genetic and vaccines for another coronary gallur, such as the crownvirus SARS.
B'N'Tlvirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by a acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Public symptoms cover fever, cough, and breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of touch, and stomach pain.
Time from the exposure to the awitan of symptoms in most of five days, but it could range from two to fifteen days.
Although most cases result from mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and fail the mahmunic organ.
Until April 17th, over 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and the mostitarian region, resulting in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 68,000 people have recovered. This virus is especially spreading human contact when it comes to close contact, often through sparks or small bits produced through coughs, scisssors, or when it's spoken.
Although it was produced while breathing, the blade usually falls to the ground or to the surface and is not contagious to the distance.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is highly contagious for the first three days after the symptoms, though the spread may occur before symptoms occur and after the next stage of the disease. Standard diagnosis is with the reaction of the actual transmeration transcrisp (rRT-PCR) chain in use of nasophaline.
The use of masks is recommended for people who are presumed to be infected with viruses and people who take care of them.
Recommendations about the use of masks by the general society differ; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend use, and others require use.
Right now, there's not a vaccine or a specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmissions have been recorded in nearly all countries in six WHO regions.
A person infected with a virus can be without symptoms or symptoms like flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing.
The emergency symptoms include breathing, pain in the chest that constantly, confusion, difficulty waking up, and face or lips; medical tension is advised if these symptoms appear.
The symptoms of breathing over, such as sleague, sanctuation, or throat pain can be found, but more rarely occur.
Gastroinstinl symptoms, such as mual, vomit, and diare, are seen in a wide percentage.
Some cases in China were initially just with a clinicicized image of chest and pallpiation.
For some, disease can grow into pneumonia, failure to organ majemuk, and death.
It's called wearout time.
The immuration period for the COVID is normally five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
The report shows that not everyone infected with symptoms in 11.5 days of infection.
The laborer without these symptoms in the transmission is not fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms and are being diagnosed, with Korea’s Control Center and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all cases are confirmed without symptoms during hospital treatment.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include a case without any symptoms in its daily case on 1 April; of 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms during testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry virus load on a large scale.
Speak out letting go more sparks or drots than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that a stone that was not covered could cause the coils to be pushed up to ten feet [4.5 m] (15 ft).
Although this virus is usually not transmitted through air, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences shows that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air-strengings located in the hallways outside the room of people create a positive sample for RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as introducation and lung resurrect (RJP), can make the pace of breathing turn into aerosol and then spread through the air.
Even though there is concern that the virus can spread through fetuses, this risk is believed to be low.
European Prevention and Disease Control Center (ECDC) said that although it is not fully clear how easy it is to spread, one person usually infects two to three others, it can last on the surface for hours until days.
Specially, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on carton/carus, for three days on plastic (positivalphilen) and rusted rust, and up to four hours on the 99% copper.
However, it's different depending on humidity and temperature.
Sabun and detergen are also effective if it is used properly; soap products outline the virus’s protective fat, destabilizing viruses, and releasing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other areas, such as corzalconicide and corhexin glucant, are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, a sample of saliva was taken in the median two days after the inp.
On five of six patients, the first sample showed the top virus charge, and the sixth patient showed the highest charge of virus on second - day testing.
The Koronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia with a pneumonia that was associated with claims of acute respiratory disease in Wlant.
All features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are on the crownvirus that's in the natural world.
Outside the human body, this virus was killed by household soap, which broke his protective bubble.
Paru is the most likely organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesss an insem cells through the enzymesin 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in alveolar type II lung.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or tonjolan" to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
But I found 12 percent of the infected people in Wlanta, Chinese, and more often in severe disease.
The rate of high illness is due to a systemic inframent response and immune system disorder during the development of disease, but mookard’s mookard injuries may also be related to the ACE2 reception in the heart.
ACE2 chairer was shown very high in the heart and was involved in heart function.
The high-employed trombombolism (25%) was found in the LOVID infection patient in ICU and may be associated with bad prognosics. Otosisi to the dead because of COVID of the nefus (D) damages (D) and instraphymation that contains in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropicale cells for telephysels that express ACE2, patients of the CIVID are heavyly underlying symptoms of systemized hyperinflution.
In particular, T cells that scored the GM-CSF pathogens proved to be compatible with the recruiting of moncelics that scored Ll-6 inflamology and severe lung pathology in COVID patients.
The limphotic Infiltrate has also been reported on the autopsy.
The WHO has applied some testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is the reaction of the polymerase transcrission of real-time (rRT-PCR) chain reaction chain.
These tests are usually performed on breathing samples acquired through nasopharing; however, samples of nasal or sputum can also be used.
Mostly, results are available in just a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but it takes two samples of blood taken with two weeks away so that the result would have a small amount of time.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate this coronary gallour and duplicate genetic decodrops so that labs around the world can develop tests of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) independent to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4th 2020, antibodi test (who can detect active infections and if someone has been infected before) is in development, but not much used.
The Chinese experience with the test shows its authenticity only 60 to 70%.
The first point-of-care test in March 21, 2020, to be used at the end of that month. Pedos was released by the University Hospital of Zhilus suggests the method of detecting infections based on clinical images and risk of epidemiology.
Opacity of ground-glass multilobarsal with peripheral distribution, assymetris, and posteriors found a lot at the beginning of infection.
Subretural domain, crazy naving (Libular septial supple), and consoles can appear as a result of disease.
A little data available about microscopic lessons and COVID pathology.
The main pathological guests in the autopsy are:
Makroskopi: pyreche, perpedicious, lung console, and emdema lunger
Four types of pneumony virus enlightenment can be observed:
light pneumonia: edema lunger, hyperpla pneumocytes, pneumocytic pneumrate pneumium, interstitial infrupt by limphotic lom, and form a large massive cell
heavy pneumonia: alveolar damage difus (DD) with alveolar limitations.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and heavy hyperksemia.
pneumonia in cure stage: Extentity in alveolar buffers and interstitial lungys
Blood: introvascular coagulation (DIC); disacceratorial reaction
The chances of reducing the likelihood of infection include staying in the home, avoiding crowded places, usually washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, hygienicing a good breathing hygie, and avoiding touching the eye, the nose, or the mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing your mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or water and recommending the use of the areas in the elbow if tissue is not available.
Higiene's hands are appropriate after coughing or insulating.
The CDC recommends the use of face - to - face covers in public places, part to restrict transmission by people without symptoms. The social restrictions are intended to reduce the contact of people infected with many, by means closing schools and places, restricting travel, and canceling major meetings in public places.
The restrictions also include keeping people at least 6 feet or eight feet [1.8 m] away.
There's no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Because vaccines expected haven't been there until the beginning of 2021, the main part in handling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as "streaping a curve".
The CDC also recommended that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, and after washing their noses, coughs, or water.
Further CDC also recommends using alcohol - based hand mutilation that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In the area where commercial hand-encousing is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicroba activity is derived from intanol or inopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria in alcohol; this substance is "not active for antipsypsics."
Gliserol was added as a hutan.
People are treated with support care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs.
The CDC recommends people who thought they were bringing a virus to use a simple face mask.
Exxigenation of extracorporum membrane (ECMO) has been used to resolve respiratory failure problems, but the benefits are still being considered.
Self - cleaning and lifestyle and wholesome eating patterns are recommended to improve immunity.
Substructive treatment may be helpful to those with mild symptoms at the beginning of infection. WHOO and China’s National Health Commission have published recommendations for handling immunely treated patients.
The U.S. intensive care expert and lung expert has set up treatment recommendations from various institutions to free resources, which is IBC.
Until April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical energy is more recommended for parastamol than a mother for the use of the first litian.
The precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of viral transmission, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosol, such as intubtation or hand vents.
For health energy that takes care of COVID-19, the CD recommends putting that person in the Insolation Infectation Infection-UD (AIRD) except using standard precautions, contact precautions, and high-air precautions. The CDC describes guidance for the use of the protection device (APD) during the term.
The recommended equipment is: APD's garment, respirator or face masks, eye shield, and medical gloves. If available, respirator (not face masks) is better.
The N95 previously approved for industrial fathers, but theper has contaminated this mask to be used by the Authorization of emergency Use (ECU).
N95 reservators are designed to protect from the inner particles of air like dust, but its effect on certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unresponsed use on labels.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends using face shield or, as a last effort, the mask is self-made.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they need mechanical or alternative vents, but some cases are really heavy.
The type of breathing support for the experience of the COVID-19 is active for people who are treated inap, and there is evidence that intructation can be avoided with high-stips or pre-servative air salt pressure.
Didn't know if any of these methods resulted in the same benefit to people who were critical.
Some doctors prefer to keep using mechanical vents, when available.
Many developed countries have no proper hospital bed, which limits the health system’s capacity to handle suddenly the amount of the COVID-19 cases so it needs an inap.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1,4% died.
In China, about 30% of the LOVID class who was treated in the ICU eventually entered the ICU.
The mechanical ventilation is getting more complicated as a result of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurred in COVID-19 and oxygen is getting harder.
Ventilators who are able to do high pressure control mode and PEEP mode are required to assess oxygen shipments and reduce the risk of lung injury and pneucomors related ventilation.
The high PEEP may not be available on the old ventilation.
Research on the potential of treatment began in January 2020, and some drug analytics are on a clinical test.
Redesivir seems to be the most promising one.
While the development of new drugs may take as much as 2021, some drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in further testing.
Drug drugs can be tried on people with severe diseases.
The volunteers who are recommended WHO join in as well as in the trials of activation and potential medical care. The FDA has given temporary authorization for convalent plasma as an experimental treatment in a person's life case is very or as well as-serta threatened.
Convalresen’s favorites haven't conducted a clinical study needed to prove its security and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched mobile applications to deal with this epidemic.
User was asked to enter their name and ID number.
This application is able to detect close contact using survey data so that it can detect the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If risk potential is detected, the application is not only recommended independent quarantine, but also tells local health personnel. Aloquence on cell data, facial recognition technology, phone tracking, and artificial intelligence is used to track the infected people and the people who are connected with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 20,20, the government of Israel allowed the security body to track down the phone data of a man who was suspected to be infected by the crownvirus.
That step was taken to run quarantine and protect people who might be in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggat the phone location of the German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the virus’s spread.
The Russians used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
The Italian regional health committee, Giulio Gallera, said he was told that the phone operator was "40% of the people still moving around".
The German government did a hackathon weekend 48 hours with over 42,000 participants.
Moreover, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the crownvirus.
People may experience pressure caused by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor who said, "Instigate social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic collapse is a perfect storm of mental health and well-being people."
This disease can take on a slight or without symptoms, which resembles airline disease over other commons, such as pills.
The mild case is usually cured in two weeks, while those who suffer from severe or critical illnesses may need three to six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for COVID-19 weight infection based on data from a similar virus, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still low in terms of, in part, COVID-19 can influence the lungs so that it causes pneumonia.
In the worst of people, COVID-19 can quickly grow into acute respiratory disease that causes respiratory failure, respiratory shock, or failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidney, and heart.
The absence of blood clots, especially the increase in protrombin time, is observed at 6% of the i.D. patients who are treated in favor, while kidney function disorders are seen at 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 image showing the increase in the liver.
According to the same report, the time of median between the symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in the inp.
However, patients who were transferred to ICU have seven days of median between ink and death.
In a study that studied early cases, median time began from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Chinese, men have a 2.8% death rate, while women have a number of deaths.
A hystopatiology sample of postmortem shows an alveolar damage of alveolar infus with cell fibrocomid limitations in both lungs.
The change of cytopic virus is observed in pneumocytes.
A picture of the lung resembles acute respiratory syndrome.
In 11.8% of death reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, the heart damage is observed, with the increase in the Furthermore or constant rate of the heart.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those treated in the hospital have a default condition. The supply of medical and economic resources can also influence fatality.
The mortality estimate of conditions varied because of the differences in the region, but it is also due to pathological difficulties.
The loss of small cases may cause death rates to be way too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean the death toll at present is too low.
But smokers have a possibility of 1.4 times more of a severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more may need intensive care or die than those not smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop in the capacity of 20% to 30% on some people who have recovered from disease, and lung scans show organ damage.
It can also lead to a post-intensive pascape syndrome after a recovery.
Until March 20,20, it was not known that previous infections gave effective and long-term immune response to people who were cured of this disease.
Imunity may be seen, if it's seen another coronary behavior, but it has been reported that the COVID-19 recovery case followed by a positive vevirus test a few days after.
This case is believed to be a bad remaining infection, and it's not resuscitated infection.
This virus is supposed to be natural and it comes from an animal, through a spread infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection is almost completely driven by human transmission to man.
A study of 41 cases confirmed by the first LOVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the early show date of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official publication of WHO reported the earliest symptoms at December 8, 2019.
Mostly, some measurements are used to count deaths.
This figure varied according to areas and with time, and has been influenced by the number of tests, the quality of health care, treatment options, the time since the first plague, and the character of populations such as age, sex, and health as a whole.
At the end of 2019, WHO set the ICD-10 emergency U07.1 for death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection that confirmed lab and U07.2 for death due to death due to clinically-deed COVID or anti-desiology without confirmation of lab infections for SARS-Co-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death ratio for global cases is 6,9% (153.822/240.191) at April 1720.
The number vary according to the region. Another size includes the mortality rate of cases (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed with certain diseases, and the fatality of infections (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people who died of certain diseases.
These statistics are not connected and followed a certain population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Although not all infected people make antibodi, antibodi's existence can provide information about the number of people that have been infected.
In the episode of the plague in Italy, Castiglone d'Adda, a small village that contains 46,000 citizens, 80 (1,27,000) is dead.
In Gangelt, this disease is spread through the Codal festival, which spreads among young people, causes relatively lower mortality, and probably not all of COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 death.
Moreover, the German health system has not yet been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3 percent of the population may have antibodi, as we examine from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) died because of COVID-19.
It's a death rate and its mortality rate is different for men and women.
Mortality is higher on a man in his study in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with a risk cell between new men and women doesn't appear at 90.
In China, death numbers for men by 2.8 percent and for women by 1.7 percent.
The reason for the difference based on this type of gender is unknown, but genetic and behavior may be an excuse.
Immunological differences based on gender types, lower smoking access to women, and men with serbid conditions, such as hypertensia, at younger age than women can contribute to more mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected people are men and 72% of the people who died because of COVID-19 are men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track the sex-based data for COVID-19 infection.
Research suggests that virus diseases, such as Ebolic, HIV, influence innsza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The behavior of women who have sex are higher in sex, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance to be exposed to viruses.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11th 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
The leader of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreesus explains that CO is short for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time the outbreak identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographic location (e.g. Chinese), animal species, or group of people, along with international recommendations intended to prevent stigmatization. The virus that led to the LOVID region has been named after a heavy respiratory respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "CVID-19" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Either disease or a common virus is called "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the plague in Witas, China, the virus and the disease are commonly called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wbour."
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for virus and disease according to 2015's guidance that refers to not using the name in the name of disease and virus.
The official name of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on February 11, 2020.
Because of the limitations in standard supply chain, some digital producers print such health care items as nasal and ventilation components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital is desperately in need of ventilation valves, and suppliers can't provide on a necessary time scale, a local company designs and prints 100 containers that are needed last night.
After the start of the COVID-19, conspiracy theory, wrong information, and informed of origin, scale, precautions, medicine, and other aspects of disease, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animal.
Sttudi failed to find evidence of replusion virus on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat this disease.
International research on the vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being done by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated "SOLIDTY Trial" to review the effects of the four-generation medical effects that already existed with the most promising success.
Vaksin is not available, but various institutions are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previously on SARS-CoV used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are both using ACE2 receivers to enter the human cell.
There are three vaccination strategies that are being studied.
First of all, researchers are designed to make a whole virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, either an inactive or dead virus, is intended to hasten the human immune response to new COVID infection.
Second strategy, subunit vaccines, aim to create vaccines that make immune systems sensitive to certain subunite virus.
In SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on S-sike proteins that helped virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzim prescription.
The third strategy is a nukleat acid vaccine.
In March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaksin contains a harmful genetic code copied from a virus that causes disease. The increase depends on it has been recommended as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials that are being carried on in April 2020.
Seven trials are trying to evaluate the treatment that has been approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxocroclins or chlorines.
A new treat that was given the purpose of forming most Chinese research, with nine test tests of Fose III on the brakesivir in some countries with a drop of time reporting at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic survey of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs was already present. Some of the techniques that were being reviewed for COVID-19 medical treatment, which included brakes, chlorines and hydrophocroclorins, will be movir/rirnavir, and lovirvir/birvirthabrir are combined with a follow-in.
In March 2020, there was a temporary evidence for the wisdom of the brakes.
The increase in calinis is observed in patients treated with brakesivr in emergency treatment.
The test of clinical Fase III is being done in the U.S.A., China, and Italy.
However, there is a call for research on the research.
Korean and Chinese Health Authority recommend chlorine use.
However, the Virology Institute Whab, despite recommending daily doses of one gram, notes that dose twice as dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 20,20, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for hydroxisculin and chorroculin policies of doctor's policy of treatment of COVID-19. The 7th European government also entered interferon, onvirin, or umifovair to be used against COVID-19.
The initial data shows that high doses are required to impede SARS-CoV-2 in a vitro.
Nitazksanide has been recommended for further studies in vivo after showing SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration. In concentration indicates that early due to protein to tons of ginger by synthease transmebran (TMPRS2) is very important to enter SARS-CoV-2 through a simple prescription with an ACE2.
The study of chloromilins and hydroxixocins with or without azitromyin has had a major limitations that have prevented medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamavir doesn't prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and have no known role in the COVID 2001 treatment.
The cytokin storm complications can happen on COVID-19 heavy levels.
There's evidence that hydroxicocrokuin may have an anti-sitokin properties, and Tociizumab has been put in treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study complete.
This drug is undergoing two phase tests at the national level of Italy after showing positive results to people with severe diseases.
Combined with blood tests of pheritin amum to identify the cytokin storm, this drug was meant to fight the stokin storm, which is presumed to be the cause of death on some of the sides.
In 2017, anagonitist of interpilentkin-6 was approved by the FDA based on a rerospective case studies for post-accupinary cyclactericide syndrome produced by a different cause, which is CAR T cell therapy.
Until now, there has not been any random and controlled evidence showing that Tociizumabs are effective treatment for CRS.
Switching refined antibodis and blessed by a man’s immune system to a man who has recovered from the COVID 19th century who needs it is being copied as a method of nonvaccine passive immunization.
This strategy is tried for SARS with unconceptive results.
The virus Netralization is a job mechanism expected for passive antibodi therapy could combine defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as mobile cytotototonosis, which depend on antibodi and/or phagototosis, also possible.
Other passive antibodi therapy, for example, uses a monocollal antibodi produced, being in development.
The production of convalents, which is part of the patient’s healing blood and contains specific antibodi against this virus, can be improved for faster use.
The disease of the crownvius, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenfort, a doctor at the Wlanc Hospital, who was infected and died because of the COVID-19 after the awareness of the virus spreading.
