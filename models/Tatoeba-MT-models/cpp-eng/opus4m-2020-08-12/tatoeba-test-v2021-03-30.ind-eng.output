Tom knows he heard something.
Health is more valuable than gold.
I will be happy to help him.
Learning about foreign culture is fun.
When did you start wearing the lens?
Tom wouldn't like that answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to contact us earlier.
Without fear, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnic and minority religion.
I must've made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too blunt until it can't be used to cut meat, finally I use my pocket knife.
Through her eyes blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's a forgetr.
Where have you been?
Backlights were used to manage traffic.
Don't let Tom see these pictures.
This room gets a little sunlight.
He's drawing a picture.
I shouldn't have broken that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I used to stay out of time.
It smells so bad.
Words are words.
There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.
I found out yesterday.
You can buy it at the bookstore.
Let's take an Intercity-Express train.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brother loves music.
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I think I can come this afternoon.
"It's not worth waiting for two hours." "Yes, I'll keep this signature for the rest of my life."
Tom was one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I'm just telling Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ant.
You'll never be able to find a way home, through a narrow road.
Tom was really not at home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
The guy's driving the car.
It's a birthday card coming.
Please read it one more time.
You can tell when?
I'm just kidding.
Tom's almost hit.
I'm going, too.
Love never is wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
It's already included payment for professional services to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn logogram, do you?
Tom tried to persuade Mary to help her.
Two things are not related.
How can I not realize this?
What's this called?
I'm staying home because it's raining.
That's the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
For me, there is no fundamental difference between the culture of both countries.
He's having an affair.
Wake me up at eight o'clock right.
Tell me why she didn't attend.
That might affect their decision.
It's been raining for a full night.
Tom's getting jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that horrible?
I'll buy this bag for you.
The cake's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Have you ever been to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready.
Mary refused an invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
He's sitting around his grandchildren.
The boy just fell asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left road.
He's focused on those riddles.
The man died a few hours ago.
Want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We knew that front door was locked.
Can I talk to Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is his acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying on a plane.
I've suspected that he's lying, but it doesn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I can't finish reading this thick book in a week.
The choice of time was very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other choice.
I'm not sure what else to do.
We've done what we can.
Any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
In front of the law we all pursue, but the rich sometimes have more advantages.
He's gonna make it.
I like cats.
The meeting's over at nine o'clock.
Tom was mentally disturbed.
Maybe I'm crazy?
We faced a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone's ever made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mother's been gone for ten years.
There's no perfect man.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, just you can't drive.
May I see your coupon?
He looks serious reading.
Tom married a girl who's easier than him.
He's a copy of his father.
He has good words to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself but in the end he failed.
Do you have any light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.

We got a lot of rain this summer.
He made an important scientific discovery.
He's a student.
Tom's here, but Bill's not here yet.
Laurie langsing.
They suggested that he go alone.
Tom's a good man.
I'll call back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom fooled Mary.
There are no less than 40 percent of students going to college.
Tom put the pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom broke his voice so no one could hear it.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he long hair?
She greets him every morning, when she enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very steep down, it's better to go to the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
Her mother's worried about her son.
What surgery is being shown at Lincoln Center right now?
I feel tired.
Tom killed Mary.
The data is often not accurate.
Get up!
We've ordered that at 6: thirty.
We named that dog Tim.
He opened that letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom led Mary to follow her.
It's 11 o'clock.
I'm smarter than them.
The sky is getting dark.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows him admires him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those guys are crazy!
