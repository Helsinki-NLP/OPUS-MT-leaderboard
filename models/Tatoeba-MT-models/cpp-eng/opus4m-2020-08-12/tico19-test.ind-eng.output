How long have these symptoms been going on?
And all the chest pain must be handled this way especially at your age
And along with fever
And your blood pressure and cholesterol should also be checked
And are you having a fever now?
And do you feel this chest pain now?
And are you also having trouble breathing?
And can you tell me other symptoms you're going through with these symptoms?
And how tall has your fever been?
and I'm also coughing
And I'm a little pill and cough.
And I feel heavy chest pain today
And this season's allergic allergies.
And it hurts the chest.
And I think I'm also a little fever.
And I want you to explain your chest pains
And they also had fever.
and with your diabetes history
And you know, my chest feels like it'll be broken
And you know, people are always coughing towards me
And you feel chest pain
And you say that there's pressure in your chest
Anyone in the family with heart problems, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
Is there any symptoms or other problems you notice together with muscle pain?
Is there anyone else who's sick like you at home with the same symptoms?
Do you feel any other symptoms?
Have you ever felt so low?
Do you still feel chest pain?
Because it's flu season.
But neither should we put aside the chest pain that comes from the heart
But the more important problem now is this chest pain
And I'm having trouble breathing
But I know a lot of coughers towards me
But we need to handle every chest pain very seriously.
But now you can breathe well?
I completely forgot the cause of this chest pain
Does it feel like someone's gonna squeeze your chest?
It still feels like breathless
Do they complain about the same symptoms?
Do you have chronic problems like high blood pressure or something?
Do you have any medical or other chronic disease like diabetes?
Do you feel the breath along with that chest pain?
Do you have high blood pressure?
Do you feel so tired of breath along with those symptoms?
Do you know what symptoms he's going through?
Did you see the picture?
Drink plenty of fluids today
But I'm running diabetes tests.
But he has a rather similar symptoms with me
How tall is your fever?
How's your blood pressure?
If your fever continues
If your fever is a hundred or higher
If you think of symptoms or problems you need to examine better
I had a fever yesterday.
I'm also a little fever.
I had a fever yesterday.
I feel pain stabbed here, in the chest
I'm also having trouble breathing
I'll send you a picture
I feel chest pain today
I just feel a little headache and fever today
In my opinion, it's flu
In my opinion, it's a little flu
Does it feel like there's someone really heavy sitting on your chest?
All started off the headache with fever at almost at the same time
It hurts in the middle of my chest
Pressures like chest pain
on my chest
in the middle of my chest
in the middle of the chest
I have pain in my chest
I'm so worried about this chest pain.
I want you to explain this chest pain
Like high blood pressure or diabetes
It's like right in the middle of the chest.
For the fever, you can drink sweet tachipirina
Mary, how many days have you been having these symptoms?
You said that you felt chest pain
Sometimes I feel chest pain
All right, is there any other symptoms along with these symptoms besides pain?
Or someone sitting on your chest?
Almost the same as fever, cough, headaches, and muscle pain
Right in the middle of my chest
Show this picture where you feel sick
Because you're fever
So, do you think some of these symptoms might be related to pregnancy?
So, your kids have some similar symptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain
The fever rises at night
My fever has been going on for two days
The fever began to rise last night.
This is Doctor Porter at the center of the emergency room.
Can you tell me more about your chest pain?
I feel pain in the front of my body, right here, in the chest
I feel a severe pain in my chest
When I felt the pain in my chest
What kind of pain do you feel in your chest?
When is this chest pain beginning?
Where do you feel pain in the chest?
Where do you feel chest pain?
You feel like tight on your chest
Do you know I suffer from diabetes and other diseases?
You said that you felt this chest pain
The accumulation of coronavirus disease (COVID) increases rapidly in the European Union/Wilayah Economi Europe and Great Britain, January 1 through March 15, 2020
The accumulation of the cases of coronaviral disease (COVID) shows similar trends in the European state of Europe/Wilayah Economi Europe and Great Britain confirm that, although it's different levels depending on the country, the COVIDian academy has developed very quickly in all countries.
According to Italian experiences, countries, hospitals, and intensive care unit should improve its preparation for the calcinary COVID patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, claims of pneumony case with unrecognised ethics were reported in Whadan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Disease Control and Prevention Center reported this corrupt agent is the new Grandvirus called the current acute acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease.
Evidence until now indicates that about 80 percent of CVIDS are suffering from mild disease, which is a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these sufferers recovered.
In about 14% of cases, COVID 19 developed into a heavier disease and needed hospital care, while another 6% of them suffered from critical diseases that require intensive care.
The mortality of patients who were treated at the hospital because of COVID 198 about 4%.
In this study, we studied the development of the COVID historic incident of the European Union/Wilayah Economi Europe (EU/EEA) and Great Britain (UH) and compared it to an incident in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of cases of CVID 19 today in EU/EA and U.S.A. with the number of cases in Italy during January 31, March 20,20.
CVID 19th case in EU/EEA and UU
After China, COVIDS experienced more geography and redemployed COVID bread in another part of the world today follows the demikad in China.
On March 11, 2020, the director of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19 to be a academy.
In Eurosurvellance 2020 of March 5, Spiti et al. reported the first European with the CVID 19th case confirmed by the definition of WHO case.
In EU/EA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 on people returning from Wanti, Hubei Province, China.
On March 15, 2020, the case of CVID 198 has been detected throughout the 30 countries of EU/EA and England (U.S.), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with that date, there are 2,78 cases and 1,77777 deaths reported, with 1750 cases and 44 deaths of Italy alone.
Getting a improved number and a progressive CVID case incident
At the European Center and Control of Diseases (ECDC), the number of cases reported to each country every day at 8,00. This number was obtained only from the official source of the state's health, national health and regional health authority, and WHO.
This data is used to assess the American COVID trend in EU/EA and U.S.A. and compare it to trends in Italy.
As a prevalence of the CVID-importion case active, we count the planned incident at 14 days, so consider the natural journey of COVID 198, in each EU/EA and UA state, in the January 1 period of January–15 March 2020.
We also present a qualified number of cases known to each country until March 1520 at 8.00 compared with the Italian case during January 31th –15Maret 2020.
Tren COVID 19th in EU/EA and U.S.A.
The master of the graduation incident was 14 days of the CVID 19th case in EU/EA and INDEA and are generally following the trend in the Hubei Province (GImbar) (Gambar 1).
For EU/EA and dU in all, the LOD creative incident began to rise about 21 February, then rise sharply around February 28th 2020.
This train is especially moved by a rapid rise in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all of the other EU/EA countries andU show a trend in the development of similar COVIDS incident.
Image 2 shows the recruit of the COVID 19th case in EU/EA and U.S.A. compared with the exquisite number of in Italy during the January 31th period – March 20,20.
The data highlights that, until March 15 p.m., 15 other EU/EA countries and U.S.A. have reported the total number of cases equal to the number of Italians three weeks earlier or less than that.
Our results indicate that the amount of COVID 19 cases that are reported rise fast in EU/EA and U.S.
Tren was observed on the NOVID educational incident indicating that pandas are increasing at equal speeds in all countries.
It's in spite of the differences in countries, differences in public health reactions, and possible differences between state definitions and protocols to choose patients who must be tested to confirm COVIDS, which include milk testing.
At the beginning of March 20,20, doctors in the best Italian district explained the situation about 10% of the COVID patient needs intensive care and media sources report that hospital and intensive care units in this region have reached its maximum capacity.
At present, the ROVID cases data are currently available to each 6% and 1% of cases (not shown) in the hospital and/or intensive care unit at EU/EA level.
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current survey data that focus on the number of cases reported and deaths.
The research done in 2010 2011 shows great variations in the provision of intensive care and medical treatment in Europe, ranging from 18.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (the bed of intensive care and medical care per 100,000 population in 2010201).
EU/EA and U.S. risk rates >90% exceed the capacity of intensive care, provided at a further rate of rapid LODC risk rate for every state of EU/EA and U.A.
Because as far as this is the last case in certain areas of EU/EA and U.S.A. and hospital and intensive care units are usually serving a certain regional services population, information about cases and intensive care should be provided at the stage of the State Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries shows that the COVID 19s developed very fast in EU/EEA and U.S.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and raise the number of patients who need medical care, especially intensive care, as it did in the best circuit in Italy.
As shown in recent ERDC risk assessment, a quick approach, professional, and compromise is essential to slowing down SARS-CoV-2, with a distraction approach to my approach, because the increase in cases, as anticipated, may not give enough time to the workers and the hospital to understand, accept, and adapt the exact response if it does not apply before.
That quick risk assessment also includes the health measures of society to assess the effect of the setting.
It's like a short window of opportunity when the country has a chance to improve its efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If failed, another EU/EA health care system is likely to face the support of patients who need intensive care within the next few days or weeks.
The calivirus 2019 (COVID) disease plague, caused by a 2-CoV-2 respiratory syndrome, has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and other places in the world, causing disaster for humans.
Similar to his homologic virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in the thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be tested from bats and caused similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Nevertheless, COVIDS has a lower rate of enlightenment and mortality than SARS, but more contagious and more about older than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about this new disease, this article is trying to provide a timely and scholarly review on the subject of fast - growing research.
We're going to discuss the basics of epidemiology, mythology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this survey will help understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Summer Festival on January 25, 2020 has been a memory that has never happened and forgotten for all the Chinese people who were ordered to stay home on vacation and weeks after the outbreak of the new virus.
This virus was highly gay with the crownvirus (COV) which caused the outbreak of acute acute respiratory disease in 2003; so it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease which is called CVDODOD).
Epidemia started in Wang, China, and quickly spread across the country and to almost 50 other countries worldwide.
Until March 2, 2020, this virus has caused 80,000 cases confirmed, with over 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died of the world.
WHO warns that COVID 19 is a "meet enemy number 1" and is likely to ruin more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (htttps www.c.nl.h.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that sets isolated virus dried off from some patients, more than 200 of them, which has been published about COVIDS, which involved bioology, mythology, mythology, diagnosis, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review is trying to involve research progress in this rapidly developing aspect of the new subject.
As possible, we're going to try to compare the CVIDS to SARS and other diseases caused by the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, epidemic in 2012).
We will also consider the things we have learned so far about prevention and prognosis of disease and some other questions that have not yet been answered, but they are urgent.
According to tradition, CV is considered a nonletal pathogen for humans, especially causing about 15% of the pillage 4.
Even so, in this century, we have found a very pathogenic CV for humans twice, that is SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of which caused a plague that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and immediately spread to many other countries with a terrible mortar and mortality.
Therefore, COVID is now the third CV epidemic in human history recorded.
As shown at Gbr. 1,1, a pneumonia’s caster was reported the first time reported from Whats on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese People's National Health Committee.
Seven days later, C.V. sequenced.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of What was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly into cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, health - care infection reported, which suggests that human-human transmission might happen.
On January 23, the province quarantine was performed in the city of Wuran and the entire public transport was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients were directly exposed to Wlan’s food market that was considered to be the first location of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).2).
Because the situation has developed very quickly, the end of the plague and the awareness must still be set.
On February 11, 2020, multiputoat study in 8.866 patients, which includes 4,021 patients confirmed, presents a more updated description of an epidemic (hthmp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHHHHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Nearly half of those infected over 50 years old, only a few under 20 years of age, and only 14 are infected under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0,31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVIDS is widely in cluster, especially in and around Hubei.
COVIDS takes an average of 5-9) days from awitan to diagnosis.
The average inquency period is 4.8 (3,0-7.2) days.
The average time starts from awit to death is a 9.5 (48-13) day.
Base analysis number (R0) is 3,77 (95% CI: 3,0-4,05) and R0 is reduced 2.23-4,8222.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, according to the actual time in transportation before the spring Festival in China.
The patient's brutality with confirmed cases of 1,44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%) and death is reduced for all patients by 3.6% (95% CI: 2,02-45).
Three major risk factors for COVID 19 is the sex (mana), age (60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CV is a large subconnect virus containing a single RNA sense.
CV can be divided into four genuss, the alfa, the beta, the suita, and the delta, with the alfa- and the family-CoV known to infect humans.
Gligoprotein tonjolan or cheating (S) the cover of the cell receivers, the enzyme of the bitterlytensin 2 (ACE 2) and the appidiltide 4 (DP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then the membrane of the membrane occurs.
Genom RNA virus is released into the sytoplasm; after replices of the virus, the genenams are accompanied by glycopropectin and the nucleus of nukleokacids forming vesicles, which then experienced a fuces with plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first human pair of SARS-CoV-2 were reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-CoV type with a genetic equivalent of over 99,98% of 10 samples involved; it's taken from the location of the plague, that's the Johnan Sea Food Center in Wan.
Geneticly, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron electron, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the very thin epitelium of human breathing.
ACE2 of mankind is found to be a prescription for SARS-CoVs as well as SARS-CoV.
Even so, the SARS-CoV2 protein is linked with the ACE2 human beings is weaker than his bond with SARS-CoV protein, which is according to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes an infection that doesn't matter with SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein associated with orf3b and protein dedicated with orf8 passwords.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may have a role in the virus pathogens and the IFNG expression expression expression; yet, orf8 has no functional domain or known motive.
On February 18, 2020, December al, reported the structure of the Cryo-EM ACE2 of humans on a double resolution in complex with amino B0AT1 acid transport.
They found that complex, which has open and closed harmony, is set up the Mermer and complex ACE2-B0AT1 can tie two protein S, which is evidence for recognition and CV infection.
B0AT1 can be a temporary target in drug filtering to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Integration and mediator
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each of them is attached to human beings through mousangs and camels.
By comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with another CV, bats are considered to be SARS-CoV-2's original SARS-COV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical with two CoV similar-SARSS from the bat called baht-COVZX45 and bat-COVX.
But the middleman who helps the virus cross the species’s barrier to infecting humans is still unknown, and the transmission route must be explained.
Ji, it al. proceeded to propose a snake as the bearer of a virus from a bat to a man involving a homologic recombination inside the protein S.
According to one study, researchers in  overseas, China, propose that the milling tea, the long-wired ant-canced mammal that is often used in traditional Chinese Chinese medicine, is possible as a SARS-CoV-2 identifying adder based on the genetic compound of CoV found in mill and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the differences spread throughout the genes are still a big difference; therefore, a concrete result as a concrete evidence has not yet been obtained (Gbr. 3).
The nature of SARS-CoV-2 physics is largely unknown.
In vitr, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days on 20 °C and 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar qualities.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ethane, 75% estaneol, sprayed chlorine acids, hypesetat acids, chloroform, and other fats, but not chorhexins, effectively disable the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and therefore it's vulnerable to this new virus.
Right now, there's no detailed study reporting on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another CoV study before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.4.
Commonly, after imunization, the virus is known by the default immune system through pattern recognition (PRR), which includes C-type stickin-le receivers, Toll-leptor (TLR), NOD-leaplore (NLR), and RI-I-I-I-I-I-Ile reception (RRRR).
Through different paths, the virus induces the expression of an inflamatory factor, dedritic cell mature, and synthesis interferon type I (IFN) which restricts the spread of the virus and speeds anti-gen anti-gend anti-gent virus.
However, the N protein on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune reactions.
Soon, adaptive immune response joined in fighting this virus.
Limfosit T, which includes CD4+ cells and CD8+, plays an important role in this defense.
T CD4+ cell installed B cells to produce specific antibodis against viruses, and T CD8+ cells kill cells that are infected directly.
The helper T cells produce sitokin proinflamatory to help protect the cell.
Even so, CV can impede T cell function by injecting T cells.
A sense of humor, which includes completions, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodi is also important in fighting virus infections.
For example, isolated antibodis from cured patients neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive immune system reaction produces a large number of locally free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, at the worst scenario, failure in the design and even death organ.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, marked with the awit club, is more about old age than the disease of the providers and pregnant women.
Mostly, people who are exposed to viruses in large numbers or whose immune functions are disturbed have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average SARS-CoV-2 period is 1 quadruple days, most 3-7 days based on the study of 425 cases first in Wupan.
However, a study of 1.099 cases shows that an average inquency period is 3 days and counting from 0 to 24 days.
More new conducted, as explained above, shows that the period of immunization is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on demography 8.866 cases.
It is vital that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate inquency period that prevents people from becoming infected, but without symptoms, regulating the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Demams are often symptoms of primary and primary COVID, with or without other symptoms like dry coughs, breathless breaths, muscle pain, joints, throat pain, kidney pain, diurea, diurea, and vomiting.
Some patients have been suspended and/or hipoxemia a week after the disease's awit.
In heavy cases the development of patient disease has occurred quickly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic asiosis, and coagulopathy.
The patient who suffers from fever and/or symptoms of breathing and acute fever, even though without lung testing disorder, should be reduced to the virus for early diagnosis.
Sttudi demography at the end of December 2019 shows that percentages of symptoms worth 98% for fever, 76% for dry coughs, 55% for rulership, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% patients need ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, which was studied in family and chumsters that were based on the transmission of asimtomatics.
As compared to that, the study of demography in 2012 showed that the MERS-CoV patient also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and suspended (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than the patient COVID 19 and consistent with MERS livity higher than CVID 19D.
Diare (26%) and throat pain (21%) is also observed on MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough %-75%), suspended (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat disease (13-25%) is shown as the main symptoms and support of ventilation is needed for about 14% of patients.
Until February 14th, CVID mortality is 2% by confirmed case reaching 66.576 worldwide.
As compared to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 is 10% of 8.096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, based on demography studies in June 2012, deaths are 37% of 2.494 confirmed cases.
The previous research reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached a height of 6,47 with a population of trust (CI) 95% by 5.7-7,23, while R0ARS-CoV is only 2 to 4.
The SARS-CoV2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in symptoms, mortality, and R0 given at Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has higher spread skills than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as deadly as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemia is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All too often found in a family or in one group or a vehicle like a cruise ship.
Patients often have travel history or live in Watur or other peaceful areas or hang in touch with infected people or patients within the last two weeks before the awit.
Yet, it is reported that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms over two weeks and patients returning from the hospital can bring another virus, thus causing caution to increase quarantine time.
At the beginning stage, the patient has a number of normal self-blooded white cells or low.
For example, slimfopeia by counting the white blood cells < 492109/L, which includes the count of simphocys < 1,0109/L, and the level of amino transferase and increased viremia found at 1.099 CVID patients.
The enzymes and muscles and microlobins are increasing in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and the rate of blood scans increases in most patients.
In a patient with a heavy case, the D-dimer levels are increasing, which is the product of fibrinsing in blood, and the count of lymphocytes is becoming more progressive.
The presence of the prints was found in large parts of COVID patients and marked with a visible shadow or spaced grid-glassity in the lungs.
Patients often experience acute pneumia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory disease (ARDS).
When ARDS occurred, inflamation instructial inflation, measuration of fluid, and progressive pybrosis is very much aggressive in exchange for gas exchange.
Disperses type I and type II pneumocyte lowers the southern level and increases surface pressure so that it lowers the lung ability to expand and increases the risk of lung laps.
Therefore, the worst discovery in the direct photo is often parallel to the worst level of disease.
On February 18, 2020, first pathological analysis indicated the predisposing of the pneumocytes, the formation of the hyalin membrane, and the exposure of interstitial lymphitis, as well as the seritial synthetic cells in patients who died of this disease, according to the pathology of viral infection and ARS, and similar to the pathological pathology of the SARS patient and MERS.
The RARS-CoV-2 Detection of the polymerase chain (RT-PCR) is used as the primary criteria for CVID diagnosis.
But because false negative levels can speed up the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) in China at February 13, 2020.
Similar situations also occur in SARS diagnosis.
Hence, the combination between the history of the disease, the clinical display, the lab test, and radiological findings is important and a need to make effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Ferng's group explained the process of SHERLOCCK-CRISPR technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects RNA SARS-CoV-CoV-Synthetic fragments on 20-18 ml-L protocol protocol protocols to 200 m-18 ml-L-L copy micro-L-L-L-L-stems input cells input, using less than an hour without a complicated instrument.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly enhance sensitivity and ease if it is verified on clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with new CVs, doctors are primarily offering support to patients COVID 19, as long as they've been tried or previously used for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral disease.2.
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with antics, immunosuppression, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma of cured patients is proposed to be used in therapy.
Pharmation companies develop antibodi and vaccines against this virus.
At the beginning stage, SARS-CoV-2 is mainly attacking the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as a gasthindol and kidney system.
However, success and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is vital to ease symptoms and save lives, which includes public oxygen therapy, high - flow oxygen, non-diversity ventilation, and mechanical ventilation, depending on the level of illness.
Patients with heavy respiratory symptoms have to be supported with extracorreum membrane oxygen (ECMO), which is the modified method of cerdipulmoner shortcut used for mental failure care or respiratory breathing.
In addition, electrolic balance guard, prevention and secondary infection care and septic control, and protection of vital organ functions is also vital for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
An excessive immune system reaction is known to cause sicotkin storms in SARS patients and MERS.
Cytokin storm is a form of systemic inflamatory response marked by series of silencies, including TNFFkins, IL-1#, LILL-6, IFNGUR, IFNGNG, IFNGAN-1, and MCP-1.
These skin-sytokins fed immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that became the main cause of RADS and failed the peripheral organ.
Immunossupressi is very important in the treatment of the sytokin storm, especially on severe patients.
The Komicsteroids and Tociizumab, an anti-Il6 anti-ILLal anti-ILL6 anti-teacher, have been used to deal with the sytokin storm.
Another imunsupression of immusuppression for sitokin included immune modulation modules directed by T cells; IFN-owing, Ll-1, and TNF; the JAK inhibib; blinatoumomab; sivoric signal 4; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids, as immune, are widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the awareness of inflamenology damage.
In high doses, however, steroids is useless for heavy lung injury to SARS patients and COVID 19 years.
On the other hand, steroids can cause major side effects, especially oxonecosis, which greatly affects prognosics.
Even so, a brief Korean gift at low doses is being encouraged to be given with caution to critical COVID patients.
At the time of writing this review, there has not been an effective treatment that has been confirmed.
However, intanventions, a nukleotide Academy, were found to be esteemed by an American COVID patient.
Redesivir is a new drug developed by Gilead, back for the treatment of the disease caused by the Elball and Marlburg virus.
Later, the remotestiff also showed inhibition of another single ERS virus, which included the MERS and the SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead provides this compound for China to do a series of tests on SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the results are very eager.
In addition, swept it off, interferon-ow, lopinavir/ritnavr, and virin has been recommended a potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diare, nausea, vomiting, damage of the heart, and other side reactions can occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/rirnavir.
This session of therapy with other drugs that patients use must be carefully monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody creation
There's a long history of the gathering of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who suffer the same disease or to prevent healthy people from developing the disease.
Granted, cured patients often have relatively high antibody levels in their blood.
Antibodi is immiglobulin (Ig) which produces sifocy B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from CVID 19 years and was diagnosed with 10 severely ill patients.
Their symptoms are improving in 24 hours, along with reducing inflamation and burden of the virus and increasing oxygen uniting in the blood.
However, the confirmation and clarification needed to be done to make the method available for a large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
Further, in addition to the active effects, some lack related to plasma must be considered accurately.
For example, antibodi can maintain excessive immune reactions and lead to synokin’s disfigure syndrome, which is a potentially threatening behavior.
An antibodi in blood is usually low and plasma is required in large numbers to care for patients who are critical.
The development and production of specific antibody production is fast enough to resist global epidemic is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells of cured patients and identify genetic code that enables effective antibodi to perform effective antibodis that are effective against proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effects are largely dependent on the combination of different components in the formula. This formula is different depending on the diagnosis of disease based on TCM theory.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or obscure because it is hard to extract or verify the components or combination of these components.
At present, since effective and specific therapy for COVIDS has not yet existed, TCM has become one of the primary alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms until now or for those who recover from heavy diseases.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Wen were found to be good enough for COVID therapy.
The top rate in CVID patient therapy is observed in some Chinese province using TCM on 8 million patients, including Gansu (63, 3.5%), Ninxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei province, which uses only about 30% of COVIDM patients, has a low rate of recovery (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other effects, such as the number and severity of patients, have to be included in evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli comments a study that compares West drug therapy (WM) alone with WM and TCM combined therapy.
They found that the time it takes for the body temperature recovery, the loss of symptoms, and the inap conditions are much shorter in the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone.
More impressive things, the rate of hunting (from low weight) is much less for WM+TCM groups than the WM group alone (7.4% above 46.2%) and mortality is lower on the WM+TCM group than the WM only (8.8%.
Even so, the TCM and security are still waiting for a more controlled test on a larger scale and on more research centers.
The other interesting thing is to characterize the working mechanism and verify effective components in TCM therapy or combination, if possible.
Most patients expected or confirmed COVID 19 are greatly afraid of an extremely contagious and even deadly disease, and the people who were quarantined also have feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and anger.
Moreover, symptoms of infection such as fever, hyperxia, and cough and side effects as well as insomia caused by Corosteroids to cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
In the early phase of SARS, a series of psychic morbiditys, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomogs, psychological symptoms, deliriums, and even suicides have been reported.
On account of contact and quarantine, as part of the public’s health response to the COVID disease, can make people feel more anxious and guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided for patients of COVID 19, people who are expected to meet them, and the public in need.
The psychological support must include the formation of a multi-discipline mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate update on SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and programs of therapy and professional electronics to avoid contact close to each other.
Effective Vaksin is vital to dislocate the transmission chain from animal reservoirs and humans infected to vulnerable hosts and often designed therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by the virus.
Efforts have been made to develop the S-based protein vaccine, which is long-term and effective in creating neutralal antibodi and/or immunity that protects the SARS-CoV.
For SARS, life - weakened vaccines have been evaluated to experiment animals.
Even so, reaching in vivo this vaccine candidate in the old age and model of legal challenges and protection against zoonotic virus infections should still be determined before clinical studies begin.
It's probably because SARS dropped 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the other hand, the MERS case and the MERS censor continues to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas because there is a constantzonotic source in the end.
The vaccine of vaccines has been developed for the MERS by using disabled viruses, DNA markers, viral vancorators, destructive particles, particles similar to viruses, and subunit units of recombiny proteins and some have been surveyed on experimental animals.
The vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2 is safe and effective for non-imuns are a very urgent and important task to control the current epidemic.
However, these difficulties are not easy to cope with because a long time to develop vaccines and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, the COVID 19 is just beginning to show his full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
In most cases patients can heal slowly without a single schedule.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVIDS is also associated with high quality and mortality in patients with heavy cases.
Therefore, the formation of the disease’s progesic model is essential for health care to bring about its services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported thus far, the following factors can affect or be associated with the prognosis patient COVIDS (Tbel 3)
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosics, which also apply to COVIDS.
COVIDS is especially occurring at 30-65 years of age with 47, a 50-year-old patient in study contains 8.866 cases as explained above.
The patient who needs intensive care tends to have predispositive and complications and is significantly older than the patient who does not need intensive care (in age 66 than 51), which represents age as a prognostic factor for the end of FOVID patients.
Type: SARS-CoV-2 more infected men than women (0,31/100,000 than 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Forrbidity and complications: COVIDS patient who needs intensive care has more likely to experience acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
The incident of the heart also made the most important reason for death on SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be blessed with colangiocytes with ACE2-positives, which can result in emotional intervention in COVID patients.
It needs to be noted that a fundamental age and disease may influence each other very well.
abnormal lab finds: C-reactive protein added to the blood reflect inflamation or network injury and is adopted as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The transition between CRP levels and enlightenment and prognosis COVID 19 has also been proposed.
In addition, the increase in lactate dehydogenase (LDH), the Amino transferase (APS), the amino transferase aminoase (ALT), and creationtin (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in different organs, especially in hearts and hearts, and are released during network damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and heart function.
Main clinical symptoms: Photos and development of temporary clinical symptoms must be considered along with other things to predict the end result and process COVID 19th.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroids is a widely used immune to support therapy for infection disease in order to reduce the severity of inflamatory damage.
Because of high doseic Corosteroids being used in SARS patients, many people who survive this disease eventually suffer avascular analycemosis with life’s life prospects and a terrible quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used on low doses and short time on COVID patients.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the epidemic of COVID 199, many patients suffer extraordinary stress because they have to undergo long - term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
The psychological association and long - term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on this far - reaching demography study, COVID 19 appears to have a different image of an epidemic of SARS.
In addition to applying in the lower respiratory channel, SARS-CoV-2 can interact efficiently on the upper respiratory channel and cause mild symptoms or symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CVs that cause pills.
Therefore, in the early phase or period of inflation, infected patients can produce viruses in large amounts during daily activities, which cause great difficulty in controlling the disease.
However, the SARS-CoV transmission happened when patients were seriously ill and most didn't happen in the early phase.
The COVID epidemic is thus much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS plague.
At present, great efforts are being made in China, which includes the quarantine of Wangan and cities around and the ongoing quarantine of nearly the entire population with the hopes of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Even though this action is very damaging the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients is down, which indicates an epidemic delay.
The most optimistic rate of the outbreak is that it will end in March and the drop phase lasts for 3-4 months.
Some other experts, however, do not have that opinion.
Paul Hunter is al. Love that COVID 19, which seems far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, it al. Makes a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and states that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of global population.
The group of Canadian researchers reported that SARS-CoV-2 detected in mid-conka and the healing patient’s throat and returned home from the hospital two weeks earlier. This indicates that the re-servable virus can be repeated episodes, similar to the effect of valet.
Even so, the promising signs happen in China, if seen based on reducing the number of new cases, which suggests that the current strategy might work.
The re-experience would cause a million cases with half also death.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease can finally be controlled.
Maybe it's similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakened his ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus that can be associated with humans.
The COVID epidemic with SARS and MERS epidemic is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted through cough or water, and maybe also through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in thesiss so that it was possible for a new transmission, which is the transmission of the case-to-the-word transmission.
The recent research in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may have been caused by malkomial infection, which included 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health - care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions must be made to protect humans, especially health - care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who happen to contact patients or those who are infected.
The first defense link that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and an N95 respirator (c. 1860-an series) to help control the spread of the virus.
The surgeon’s surgery keeps a splash of a person who is potentially infected from being exposed to air or attached to the surface of the material, where the spray has been passed on to others.
However, just an N95 mask that can protect against the virion inhalation with the size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virion can completely redenetate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both size about 85 nm.
Since particles can attach even five surgical masks to one, direct health care providers with patients have to wear N95 (the number of 1860s) and not the surgeon masks.
In addition to masks, health - care providers must wear appropriate isolation coats to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, an infected Dr. SARS-CoV-2, even though he wore an N95 mask; the virus may enter his body through the eye supply.
Therefore, health - care providers should also wear a visible shield or glasses while working with the patient.
For the general community in the peaceful or potentially comfortable areas, it is recommended that everyone wash his hands with soap more often than usual, try to stay home for independence, and avoid contact with people who become infected.
The three-foot range is believed to be appropriate to keep distance from the patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, the high homicide with SARS-CoV, as reported on at January 7, 2020, must be a great warning for Chinese having strong memories of the SARS epidemic in 2003.
Even so, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wean Disease Control Center calmed the population by saying that this new virus has a low quality and limited diversity of man to man’s control and prevention of disease is not a problem.
This message is very calming the fear of society, especially as the whole country is preparing for the spring Festival, so this critical time passes out to protect the still small - scale disease in Wan.
The body of disease in China should learn from this and make great improvement in the future.
For example, this body should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because every word is noted by its citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and react to information in the least less than waiting for an official report from a doctor or an official officer; (3) more restricting potential loss in the early stages, and not trying to calm the public; and (4) more effective training to improve public awareness of disease and testing public response systems.
The COVID virus was born as a result of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to split in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague had spread across China and over 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and COVID symptoms and SARDS as well, the COVID 19th plague has been affected like a recurred SARS plague.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID 19 and SARS, which are very important to preserve an epidemic and deal with patients.
COVID is more about older than young people and more about men than women, and the rate of death is higher than young people.
SARS brutality is higher than COVIDS mortality (10.91%).
The COVID patients were able to counter the virus even when they were without symptoms, while SARS patients were usually armed with viruses when they were very ill.
It explains most of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
A typical RNA to check the SARS-CoV-2 can give a negative result on some FIVID patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can give positive results to virus examinations.
These findings are greatly increasing the risk of the spread of the virus.
So fast the progress of COVID 19 research, some important problems still have to be solved, which is:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although it was discovered at 96% of SARS-CoV-2 and two CoV similar-SARS bats, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal becomes a middle-class species to link the virus from the home of the host, say the bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number one and 2, we can't launch the transmission effectively and the plague can double at any time.
Even though molecular organizer and biochemics show that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly did the virus get into the breathing cell and cause the next pathological change?
Does this virus also connect with cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot reach fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How did the virus develop geneticly during transmission between humans?
Will this academy be a world-desteem, end up like SARS, or repeat it periodically like flu?
The answers to the questions above and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
Even so, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
The origin of human glory viruszootics
For thousands of years, mutate and adaptive have moved the co-generation of the crown virus and his host, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CVs (HCoV) were known to cause minor disease, such as the cold.
The heavy acute respiratory syndrome and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) turned around and revealed how HCoV infection can be very damaging and threatening.
The SARS-CoV2 in China in central China at the end of 2019 has made CVs back and surprised us with high transmissions, but with lower pathogens than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis.
Most HCoVs are from bats.
Some HCoV reservoir reservoirs have also been known.
The identifying animal host has immediate implications in human disease prevention.
CoV-inang interaction investigation can also provide important insights about CoV pathogens to humans.
In this survey, we present a general image of knowledge today about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of its discovery and the origin of the zootics and its transmission.
The important thing is, we compare and contrast the HCoV from the evolutionary point of view and combination.
CoV 2019 (COVID) disease epidemic is now discussed in this context.
In addition, successful hosting requirements and implications of the virus evolution on the delivery of disease are also under way.
The crown virus (CoV) is from Coronaviridae's family, made up of a bunch of hype virus, a positive dandra, and a single link.
This virus has the biggest genom with size 26 to 32 kilobasa between an RNA virus called "CoV", because it looks like a crown under an electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CV has an unrespoiled gene that has similar sequences.
About two thirds of the genoms consisted of two large open - open materials (ORF1a andORF1b) which are joined together. Both are combined into polyprostein reprotein rep1a and pp1ab.
Poliprotein has further processing to form 16 nontructure proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the geneom consists of an open set of building proteins, which include tonjolan or cheating (S), veil or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nukleoprotein (N).
A number of specific complement proteins for a specific bloodline are also suspended by the various CVlines.
Based on the difference in protein sharings, CV is classified to four genuss (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, emamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genuss, the Biiba-CoV has the most HCoV and is divided into four lines of descent (A, B, C, and D).
The archaeological evidence suggests that bat and welfare animals are the source of genes most of the Alpha-CoV and coV, while the unggas are the main reservoir onga-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CV has constantly crossed the barriers of the species and some CV has become an important pathogen to humans.
Until now, there are seven human CVs known.
Among the seven viruses, HCV-292 and HCoV-NL63 are alfa-CoV.
Five of them covered HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HUKO1, a heavy acute respiratory virus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-292, HCV-OC43, HCoV-HUKA1, and HCoV-NL63 usually causes minor symptoms, such as pills and/or diarrhea.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are very pathogenic, causing low - control infections in relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing into a acute pernance syndrome (ARDS) and displaying outside the lung organ.
The first HCoV-292, B814, is isolated from a patient's Ingus in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, a lot of knowledge has been gathered through deep study of HCoV-29E and HCoV-OC43, which both caused their own recovery symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is usually harmless, until the SARS plague occurs.
The SARS plague that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating epidemics in history today, which infects more than 8,000 people with an estimated 10% death rate.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to an ongoing epidemic in the Arab Peninsula with the preaching of different parts of the world.
HCoV new 2019 (2019-nCoV), which is next called SARS-CoV-2, is a mustative organisation agent of 2019 (COVID) virus disease (COVID), who has taken more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
Alarm has gone off and the world must prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 academy to come.
Seven HCoVs all have a zootic origin of bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of all HCoVs of bats. In bats, CVs are well---in-the-arted and nonpatogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID 19 has raised the challenge of medical, scientific, social, and moral problems for China and the whole world.
The origin of the HCoV zoo gave the working skeletons to understand natural history, drive, and the restrictions between species.
This research can also guide or harm the search for reservoir animals, middlemen, and SARS-CoV-2 installations, which have important implications in future public prevention.
In this survey, we provide a general picture of the origin of zootics, interracial transmissions, and HCoV pathogens.
We specifically focus on the general topic that HCoV's parent virus is usually nonpatogenic in its natural reservoir, but became pathogenic after transmission to new host.
We also review HCoV's evolution trend that transmission skills are often associated with a decline in pathogenism.
The end result of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before HCoV-292 Extrain B-strain first of patients who were exposed to colds, various CVs had been isolated from various infected animals, including rhino, rats, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief review of HCoV's discovery history in chrological order (Tbel 1) is an informative clue.
The first HCoV-292 was isolated from the patient's breathing channel that was exposed to the upper respiratory infection in 1966, which was later adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung.
The patient infected HCoV-292 shows a symptoms of cold, which include headaches, colds, and throat pain, along with fever and coughs seen in 10~20% of cases.
Next in 1967, HCoV-OC43 is isolated from organ culling and sequenced circuits in the still scitating brain.
The description of HCoV-OC43 infection seems to be similar to an infection caused by HCoV-29E, which symtomaticly cannot be separated with other respiratory pathogen infections such as A and rhinovus virus.
HCoV-29E and HCoV-OC43 spread worldwide and tend to be the most sustained during winter in the local genetic region.
Usually, these two viruses are less than a week and are followed by sick for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, a healthy person infected HCoV-29E experienced a mild cold.
Only a few patients with a weak immune system that shows a deep - air infection.
SARS, also known as "pneumonia ampia", is the result of the first HCoV well described in human history and its ethitological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first SARS case can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS Epidemide caused 8.096 cases reported with 774 deaths, scattered in many countries and continents.
In spite of the super pen, every case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with a period of 4 to 7 days and the top burden of virus is seen on the 10th day of disease.
The patient who infected SARS-CoV was beginning to experience myalgics, headaches, feveres, and fevers, followed by dispseas, coughs, and breathing disorders as an advanced symptoms.
Limfopeia, an unusual heart - function test, and an increase in birth creation is a common lab disorder in SARS.
The damage is replaced by alveolar, the transformation of the epitel cell, and the increase of macrophag is also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower breathing channels, some organs that include gast Hexinols, hearts, and kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, usually accompanied by sytokin storms, which can be deadly, especially in patients who are weak.
The first virus is isolated from an open lung biosisis of zero patients who travel to Hong Kong from  speaks.
Since then, efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 isolated from a 7-month child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
This virus was once very common to young, old, and immune patients who suffered from respiratory disease.
Coriza descriptions, interests, fevers, and bronics are common to the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent research explains the same viral isolation of the male male year 8 months of Pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Despite being identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually scattered around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.5 general respiratory diseases and the peak of events occurred in the early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with theobstructructive lastis, also called the crew.
In the same year, HCoV-HUKO1 is isolated from 71-year-old man who was ever treated because of pneumonia and bronkiolitics in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronicist community, HCV-HUKO1 reported related to acute asthma spending.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-292, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HUC1 found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
Four HCVs of this entire community have adapted to humans and generally have a small possibility of mutating into pathogens. Even so, extraordinary cases are happening because an unknown reason, as in cases of HCoV-NL63 subtype cases that are recently reported to cause major respiratory infections in China.
Mostly, when we get the ability to move efficient and continue to defend ourselves in human beings, violence and HCoV pathogens are also diminished.
MERS-CoV was isolated first in 2012 from 60-year-old patients who had acute pneumonia and had a kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the lab confirmed cases come from the Middle East, import cases frequently include secondary activity for close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisia lands.
Another secondary plague occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 1886 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical behavior is similar to SARS clinical manifestations, which are characterized by progressive apologic pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which so far happens to MERS in between HCOV diseases.
More than 30% of patients show gasthindol symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Up to February 14, 2020, more than 25,000 lab confirmed cases reported with the high death of the case, which is the size of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most frightening viruses known by humans.
During the middle of December 2019, the professor of pneumonic patients who were telespectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection found in Wupan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the process of low - breathing infections that are taking place and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as Global Health Care and named the disease COVIDS.
Until March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a number of violent cases of 3.4% deaths.
It must be noted, the death of the case in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the death of cases outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with fever images, cough, and breathing.
Diare was also found on a number of patients.
Pneumia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory syndrome syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of a high nuleotide sequence, by 82%, both group into a different branch of the D.A.
The SARS-CoV-2 path is obviously lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV2 infected subject without symptoms has been reported and may have played in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 fast worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs showing a very interesting equation and difference.
First, it's a very similar period of inflation and duration of HCoV's disease.
In that case, SARS-CoV-2 follows another six HCoV trend.
Secondly, the COVID 19th title lies between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (coV-292, HCoV-OC243, HCoV-HUKA1, and HCoV-NL63).
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common image in HCoV community infection, which includes the description of mild nonspecific symptoms or even symptoms.
On the other hand, a small part of a bad CVID case can look like SARS-CoV infection even with a little lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting pattern characteristics, has a surprise with HCoV communities and SARS-CoV.
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2's transmission skills are at least as high as HCoV community.
On the other hand, reducing no SARS-CoV-2's transmission skills after some lines on humans still need to be verified, as the SARS-CoV case and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, just like the other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the case sample.
"Is SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission a major role, as in the SARS-CoV transmission case, at least in certain situations, it still needs to be classified by the next study."
It's also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasoned like in HCoV community cases.
In any case, the SARS-CoV-2 image, which includes transmission ability, pathogenity, and continued preaching in some of the paths in humans, will have a great effect on the end of the ongoing COVID epidemic.
Four HCoV communities that cause light symptoms have all adapted to humans.
Seen from another point of view, humans can be said to have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCOV and humans may be the species of ancient HCoV rescuers.
HCoV is causing a severe disease on humans and humans who are suffering from heavy HCoV are already gone.
In order for this to happen, HCoV has to apply in humans a proper amount to allowing adaptive mutate memory to fight the factor of immune restraint.
That way, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 plague survives and more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to adapt to man.
If the virus adapts properly, the transmission to humans will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four CV communities have been on human population and triggers the cold in the immuncompetent person.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoirs.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are highly pathogenic to humans and the transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
Both have to defend themselves and perform breeding in the zoonotic reservoir and seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or some middle-messer and adalifyer.
SARS-CoV-2 has a picture similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is easy to compromise like HCoV communitys, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCoV community and not as special as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be observed if SARS-CoV-2 will adapt fully to human beings and commit in humans without reservoir or middleman.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the immune, natural, reservoir, mediator, and HCoV amplification.
Animals act as HCoV's hostess if they have close ancestors and share high conscience at nukleotide dry level.
The ancestor virus usually adapts well and is nonpatogenic in this host.
Likewise, reservoir hosted HCoV in advance and over a long period of time.
In these two cases, an infected host is naturally infected and is a natural host to HCoV or parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV has recently entered the media host right before or about the time of the virus into humans, the virus has not adjusted to a new host and often is a pathogen.
This middleman can function as a source of human infection and play as an amplification host by allowing the virus to duplicate for a while, and then regulating it to humans to alter the scale of human infection.
HCoV can experience a death infection if it can't maintain its transmission in the media host.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to a middleizer and even cause long - term emdestence.
In this case, the middleman's host becomes a natural reservoir.
The epidemiology data is telling post-consponsively that the SARS case has a history of contact with game animals.
The next seroprevacy study indicates that those animal dealers have an IgG anti-SARS-CoV prevention higher than the general population.
The month's quadrups and rascon dogs at the animal market are first identified with similar-SARS-CoV viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
In short, this is supported by the fact that SARS's case has been reported since the whole market was killed.
Even so, it is reported that the moon is from the wild or the unstainted farms to the animal market, most of which provide a negative test for SARS-CoV. It points out that the moon was probably only acting as a began-infiding host, but not the SARS-CoV natural resort.
It must be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the market have anti-SARS-CoV anti-COV anti-descendables, could not be passed on that maybe many small species of mammals also serve as SARS-CoV implanters.
All this host seems to be SARS-CoV's final host.
The search for natural animals for SARS-CoV later reveals the nearby CV bat, called CV Rhilolopus relative-SARS HIA3 (SARSS-Rh-BatCoKU3), which is found on Chinese horsetops.
This experiment provides positive results for anti-SARS-CoV anti-COV anti-RARSSr-Rh-BatV HKO3 antibiotics.
This CV and another CV bat share a nukleotide coleoticist 88-22% with SARS-CoV.
This research becomes the foundation for a new concept that bat is welcome to a new human pathogen.
Some CV looks like-SARS (SL-CoV) also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
Azim transformer 2 (ACE2) is known to be SARS-CoV receivers.
The WIV1 that comes from the test test test sample is shown using ACE2 bats, mousangs, and humans as receivers to enter the cell.
It's interesting, SARS patient serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the closest ancestors to SARS-CoV on bat, with a nukleotide collusion of 95%.
Despite the height of homicide between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus SARS-CoV and bat not a direct reservoir direct SARS-CoV.
The analyzetic analysis group MERS-CoV into the same group as CV-HUKO4 bats and CV-HUKO5 bats.
CV-HUKO4 bats and MERS-CoV using the same host receiver, which is the 4 termidide perpide (DP4), as the way to get into the virus.
The remaining RNA polymerase depends on the MERS-COV-Coetically closer to its coms in the family-CoV bats identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, there haven't been an MERS-CoV alive found in a wild bat.
MERS-CoV and the closest relative of CV-HUKA25 bats only shared 8 million nukleotide compounds.
Therefore, the bat may not be a direct reservoir MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the study in the Middle East shows that Arab camels provide a serviceative result for specific antibodis that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like Middle Eastern camels in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives that are identical with the virus found in humans isolated from the Arabic camel use. This further indicates that the camel is an actual reservoir iservoir pool for MERS-CoV.
It's also important to note that moreific virus bullets with symptoms that are usually severely observed in the experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It must be noted, infected camels turn the virus down not only through breathing routes but also through a fecal-oral route, which is also the main route route of the bat virus from the bat.
Even so, the question still remains unanswered because many cases are confirmed have no contact history with the camel before symptoms, possibly caused by human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving an unknown species that brought MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleus of rukleotide with CV RTG13 bat isolated from Rhiolopus affics bat.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, secular differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to establish parent relations.
In other words, bats may not be direct reservoir direct SARS-CoV-2, unless the CV bat is almost identical found in later days.
It is likely that the SARS-CoV-2's animal host is among the species sold and killed at the Memorial of the Memorial of the John Sea.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic depreciation indicate that a small group of extinct mammals, known as a milling trend, may also carry a beta-CoV ancestors associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Genom CoV is this new mill sharing 85-92% of necheotide-Cordal compounds with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CV is associated as close to RaTG13 in common as much as 90% on a nukleotide dry level.
Both are grouped into two subsets of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 trees in an auratic tree, one of the share of the home-specific domains (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a parallel equivalent of amino acid as 97.4%.
What's remarkable is that RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 are much different, even though the rate of homicide runs high.
Previously on the sick mill trend also reported the case of the virus from the lung sample, which had also been associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This research adopts a different method of treatment and manual currencies to produce a partial gene sequence made up of about 86.3 percent of the virus's complete genom.
We can't rule out the possibility of milling as one of SARS-CoV-2's spiders.
However, there is no evidence currently supporting SARS-CoV-2 comes directly from the milling trend because of the consistent differences between SARS-CoV-2 and co-IV relatives-CARS-CoV-2 grinding.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-comV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 path in bats, milling trends, and other mammals must still be set.
Even though RBD's highest-rescended remains were found between SARS-COV-COV-COVS-COV and RaTG13 sharing the highest homicide at the entire gene level.
It's far too speculation if it's said that the high level between RBD-CoV relatives-CARS-CoV-2 is driven by politicalized evolution.
Hypothesis is supporting recombination between the beta-CoV relatives-CARS-CoV-2 milling and RTG13 in the third wild species.
As a factor of evolutionary censorship, there's a lot going on between the beta-CoV.
Researchers still can't decide on SARS-CoV-2's origin.
Apart from HCoV very pathogenic, the origin of HCoV-29E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HASI1 has been examined too.
The archaeological evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-29E may be from CV bat, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HUTO1 are found in farm animals.
It is reported that the CoV bat named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CV) detected in North America's three - color bat shows a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-292 live with another CV bat, by the name of Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19, detected in Ghana, with Cameldae is thought to be his middleman.
To be more clear, the knowledge of the current HCoV animals known to be painted in Draw 1 and Table 2.
The Nealytic analysis has provided evidence of the development of HCoV transmission in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed the species of animals to infect humans, it was recorded as a control infection.
The history of HCoV-292 interracial transmission is not very clear.
Alpha-CoV bats associated with HCoV-29E have been found.
Between them, there's alfa-CoV alaka.
Some evidence supports direct virus transmissions from bats to humans.
First, man, not alpatra, who may be connected with bats in a joint ecological necklace.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with the alpatra.
Secondly, alfa-CoV bats associated with HCoV-29E are diverse and nonpatogenic in bats, while alfa-CoV alpaca causes respiratory disease to become infected.
Lastly, alfa-CoV alkasa was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaka getting the alfa-CoV relatives-HCoV-29E of humans is not to be held aside.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogen virus, which includes rabies virus, Ebolic virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats may directly dictate HCoV-29E to humans.
Other possibilities, while alfa-CoV bats serve as a HCoV-29E gene necklace, alpa and Arabic camels may function as a medium memorial that deals with the virus to humans, exactly as the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is a very good example for transmission between bats to Arabic camels and from Arabic camels to humans.
The origin of MERS-CoV of the bat is known for initial identification of the virus and also strengthened with the discovery after.
Clearly, bats are a supply of rich species of viruses for the exchange of genetic fragments between discreet and interracial transmission.
Long age, close - knit colonies, close social interaction, and powerful flying skills, all are conditions that support bats to be ideal virus control.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has adapted to the camel that has changed from the middleman's host into a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintain relatively low mutate rate in this animal.
His transmissing transmission to the human beings happens by chance and humans remain the final host for MERS-CoV because the transmission can't continue.
Unlike the role of the camel in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the grinding trend, if there is, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Especially, the beta-CoV is very pathogenic in the milling trend.
SARS-CoV-COV relatives may be the last host in the SARS-CoV-COV case.
In the future studies, some possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission between animals to humans must be considered or passed.
First, bats could be reservoir host to SARS-CoV-2 relatives that are almost identical with SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological necklaces with bats through sacrifice or coal mining.
Second of all, the milling trend could be one of the middle-in-the-SARS-CoV-2 hostess for the new SARS-CV-2 family virus.
Man's got a virus through sacrifice and the consumption of game meat.
Maybe, a lot of mammals, including pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Revei antibodi against pets and wild animals needs to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adapting SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species both with bats and grinding trends.
SARS-CoV-2's search for animals is still under way.
Despite the various types of animal immunes, three major factors from the side of the virus are also important to make it easier for CoV to cross the barriers of species.
First, his relatively high mutate rate in the RNA duplicate.
Compared to another single RNA virus, the estimate of CV mutation rate can be considered "high" to the average substitus rate of ~10-4 per year of descent, depending on CoV adaptives to new host.
CV has an exiibonicizer, disorientation resulting in a very high capabilities, antenuation, or even inviability.
The interesting thing is, U.S. U.R. R.D. Redesivor's architecture is known to suppress CV's reactions through these exobilitional inhibitiments and the polymerase RNA depends on-RNA.
Redesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical experiments.
Even so, the CV mutation rate is about a million times higher than the rate of initial resuscitation.
In addition, navigational speed is often high when CV hasn't adapted to the host.
Compared with SARS-CoVs that have a high rate of mutation, SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate actually lower, displaying higher adaptive levels to humans.
Possibly, the SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another host associated with humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this is also true of MERS-CoV that has adapted to Arabic camels.
In theory, it's unlikely that genetic lapses will quickly create vaccines and an agent for SARS-CoV-2 to become ineffective.
Second, a large RN gene in CV gives extra flexibility in gene modifications, for mutation and recombination, so raising co-generation probabilitys, which are profitable to appear new CoVs at appropriate conditions.
It's supported by a number of unique open - open reading designs and the function of proteins that are indicated at the end of 3 million genes.
Third, CVs are often randomly converted during RNA duplicates through unique "option-salin" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing vessel, untape transition often occurs during the CoV transcripatory transfer.
The complete RNA and very gay subgenic subgenics can experience recombination to form new CoVs.
Natural recoV-HUKO1 and HCoV-OC43 evidence, as well as on the HV animals like SL-CoV bats and CV-HUTO9 bats.
Interaction of virus-inang in connection with transmission
In addition to three factors mentioned above, virus interaction with immune receivers is another major factor affecting interracial transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV combination is considered to be a typical example, which also shows positive proof of a positive selection during interracial transmission events.
By comparing analysis between the SARS-CoV human and bosang, SARS-CoV is expected to have a quick adaptability in various hostes, especially with mutate on RBD protein S.
Mostly, RBD protein S CV interacts with cell receivers and intensively becomes a target for immune antibody reactions.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318 amino acid to the 510 fragment of S1, which is related to human ACE2 and the driver as the path to the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to identify an ACE2 receivers, including bats, mousangs, rats, and raccoons, so allow the transmission of the virus between the population.
In fact, only 6 amino acid reviews are seen differently between the human virus's acid and the mousang at RBD and 4 of them located at the motive for the reception purposes for interacting with the ACE2 receiver.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N and S487T in his RBD, which may increase to the level of tonjolan protein interaction with the ACE2 receiver.
In other words, these two amino substitute acids may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
It must be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receiver as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein units is applied to the status of the protein protein S with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows the order of human ACE2 binding and SARS-CoV-2 protein 10 to 20 times higher than the size of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein.
It's also important to know whether there's another driver that might be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with a different part on S.
There are many other HCoV receivers, such as aminopeptide N for HCoV-29E and the 9-O-earthile acid for HCoV-OC43.
These rescuers may also play in the success of this CV adaptability in human beings after transmissions from their animal host.
In addition to cell receivers, the end result of HCoV transmissions is also set up by other dependencies and hosting factors.
The difference between humans and typical reservoirs, such as bats, Arabic camels, and farm animals can be a barrier to interracial transmission.
HCoV has to take over the factor of hosting and breaking into a hosting factor to make it successful in intercomposing transmission.
In this case, molecular judgment in the field of these important viruses must still be identified and characterized.
The entire genom layer is not good enough to see the factor of the SARS-CoV-2's dependence and introductory hostation may be helpful.
New HCoV highlight: back to the beginning of the plague
The CoV bat hierarchy gives a huge opportunity to show up new HCoV.
In this case, CV bats serve as a HCoV gene necklace.
In addition, quick munitions and genetic combinations also move HCoV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, obtaining or losing new protein breeding genes may be possible to modify the virus’s phenotipe dramatically.
Among the SARS-CoV access proteins,ORF8 is expected to play an important role in adapting to human beings because the family-ARS-CoV bats are isolated found in various proteins ofORF8.
SARS-CoV with a typical feature of 29 nukleotides found on a resuscitated exhibit at the beginning of human epidemic.
This removal separatesORF8 intoORF8a andORF8b and is expected to be a adaptive mustation that supports the host's diversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history combined with an alfa-CoV line and agamma-CoV, with a large number of smaller recombiny areas identified in RNA polymerase that depend on RNA.
The recombination location is also identified in Nsp9, mostly nsp10, and most of Nsp14.
In the same way, the recobining events between various descendants are shown in MERS-CoV epidemic, which happens in Arabic camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in HCoV another HCoV where HCoV has experienced recombind with another CV in his nontrucial gene.
It must also be warned that artificial selection can play in an accidental change in the region, likely caused by the release of the virus from the pressures of the selection, such as by an immune immune system.
This example of effect is the loss of ORF4 complete on HCoV-29E sourced from the loss of two nucleuss.
While ORF4 can be observed on the bat virus and the camel associated with HCoV-29E, alfa-CoV alpata shows a single nukleotide side resulting in frame shift.
Lastly, new HCoV evolution was also moved by the selection pressure of his reservoirs.
The symptoms are light or without symptoms detected when CV bats are infected, which show adaptability between CV and bat.
It seems that bats adapt well with CV in anatomy and physiology.
For example, a disability in the operation of proinflamation in the bat will lower the pathological pathology that CV is efficient.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells on bats is pressed due to the rise of the natural NKG2/CD94 sub-introductive molecular expression of the primary class I class.
In addition, the rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) high from high metabolic activity can suppress CV reactions and influence exposure by the exibonics so that giving selection pressure for the development of highly pathogenic viruses when they enter the new host.
More pathin CoV may also develop through recombination, resulting in a new protein gain or feature of the hostive adjustment.
Therefore, it's not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two compounds.
CV is nonpatogenic or causes light symptoms in his reservoir host, such as bats and camels.
CV applied strongly without triggering a strong immune reaction.
Here lies the secret of a host without symptoms and causes a heavy case in human infection.
Heavy symptoms are especially due to excessive immun response effect and sytokin storms, with more severe lung damage if immun's response is getting stronger.
Instead, to the host without symptoms, immun's response is removed from CV applications.
The same strategy to decide the success of immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly powerful on the bat.
Therefore, a gift interferon type I, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection to humans, should be of benefit.
In addition, the NLRP3 in the bat is defecated.
For this reason, infebluation inflamum NLRP3 with MC950 may be helpful in COVID 19th C.E.
SARS-CoV's appearance follows the general sequence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While I-CoV bats are sharing 95% of a nukleotide holocide with SARS-CoV have been found, there are CoV bats who share 96% of the nupleotide with SARS-CoV-2.
Even though the angel and other animals in the market were found carrying an identical virus with SARS-CoV, direct identification for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
Beta-CoV is a very gay mill with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which suggests that milling trends may play as one of the media's admirers or beta-Comergss may contribute a gene fragment at the end of SARS-CoV-2.
Even though there is still no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is created by humans both intentionally and accidentally.
CV is back to the center of attention because of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic recently.
The CoV research on bats and other animals has changed our perceptions about the origin of zootics and animal reservoirs to HCoV on human transmission.
There's so much evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 comes from bat and is passed on to humans by the media host.
Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and beings in the wet market, maybe the wet market cover and the murder of all these killings that end the SARS epidemic effectively.
With the same reason, the mill trend was supposed to be transferred from wet market to preventzonotic transmission, given the discovery of some of the familylines of mine-CoV the grinding mill close to SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms to humans through milling trends and other mammals must be classified in the future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV's been in Arabic camels for a long time.
These camels serve as important transport tools as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin, and wool products for local people.
Arab camels spread widely throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we can't kill all the camels to control MERS, as they do at a wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS plague, a compromiseal approach must be done to develop vaccines for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infections control steps.
Before we get rid of this virus, the new genotype can appear and cause the plague.
CoV zonotics run in the wild.
In particular, CV bats are potentially zootic.
There's a lot of possibilities for this CV zoonotic to evolve and experiencing recombination, resulting in a new CoV that's easier to commit and/or more deadly for human beings in the future.
Culture eats wild animals in some places in China must be abandoned to reduce contact that does not need between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS, and COVIDS, preparation and plans better to apply.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet long ago.
These viruses are in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance to preach.
Although the bat has many features supporting the spread of the virus, the chances of human contact with bats and other species of wild nature can be eliminated if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
Reveilans continue against mammals need to be done to understand the technology of CV and its natural host, which will prove beneficial in preventing human transmissions and subsequent epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonois virus is that humans must keep distance from the natural ecromalogic reservoir virus.
Some pieces of zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 puzzles have yet to be found.
First, if the bat activates SARS-CoV-2's virus into milling trend, conditions when bats and trends are forced to share an ecological necklace is the important thing to know.
Second, if the bat has a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans connect with bats must be determined.
Third, if there's a third mammal that plays as the actual mediator, the way the mammal interactes with other species, which include humans, bats, and milling trends must be explained.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both trials and surveys must be done.
Whether bats, trends, or other mammals, are expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent virus is almost identical to his natural host in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this field will outline the SARS-CoV-2 path in animals, with important implications in COVID prevention and control of man.
The update of the "unexposed case" and "the confirmed case" of COVIDS needs to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published quick counsel for diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection. This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to fighting inheritance worldwide.
Even so, the coronavirus 2019 (COVID) disease is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on current research findings and practical clinical experiences; therefore, strategy diagnosis and treatment is being updated as well.
In this letter, we answered one of the comments on our guidance and provided the latest diagnosis for "unexposed" and "the confirmed case" based on the Diagnosis Guide and Supportment for COVID (the seventh) composed by the National Health Committee of the Chinese Republic.
In December 2019, the new crownavirus has caused the plague of 2019-nCoV, which is now officially called coronavirus 2019 (COVID) and it is named the crownvirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described COVID 19 as a academy.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a fast counsel guide and the guide has been published online at Military Medical Research on February 6 February 2020.
They have been attracted by it since publication.
However, it must be noted that the CVID 19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on findings of research that are taking place and practical experiences of clinicalism; therefore, strategy diagnosis and management is being updated as well.
For example, the Diagnosis Guide and Supportment for CVID 198, produced by the Chinese People’s National Health Commission (htttractwww.nc.g.gov.cn/), between January 16 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has issued seven editions of the context have been changed quite much.
Our guide received comments from the situation. They introduced a simple score score proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence for our guide and is a valuable reference to the world’s bread.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
Even so, their work also requires an update based on Diagnosis Guide and control for the latest COVID (the seventh test) and new studies.
According to the seventh edition ( March 3, 2020), to confirm the unexpected case required the combination of one of the descriptions of the equilogical history with two clinical manifestations to create a conscious analysis, or the need for the three clinical manifestations if there is no clear historical history:
The history of epidemiology: (1) the history of travel or living in the nearby town of Whadan and surrounding areas, or other community of COVIDS has been reported in the last 14 days before the symptoms; (2) contact history of SARS-CoV-2 (with a case of positive acid); (3) contact with patients who are affected by fever or respiratory symptoms from the city and the surrounding areas, or another community where the COVID has been reportedly reported in the last 14 days before the symptoms of the results of the results of the case (the case).
Clinic radiation: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) feature of COVID infection infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells shows the normal number of lymphocytes, declines, or decrease in the early aswit.
Diagnosed of confirmed cases must be based on one of the unexpected cases with one of the evidence pathogens or syntheologicals as follows: (1) the real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full absence of the virus shows a high obesity for known crownvirus; (3) positive for specific antibody IgM and antibodi IG on SAR-V-2 in test; or the specific IGVV-VVV-IV-IVV-prot from positive phase.
We can see that the real PCR-time acid test in a respiratory or blood sample is added to the second edition ( January 20,20) and three January 2020).
The pathogen detecting blood samples added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth ( February 20,20); then, the thymology is added to the seventh edition.
It is based on the ongoing research of researchers to find certain antibodiated acid detectors for quick diagnosis, as well as samples of breathing channels, which increase the supply of various speculations, and support the positive application of the antibodi results into the confirmed criteria.
Moreover, there are more evidence that reminds us to guard against patients with aggravating symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, it must be updated because they introduce people without clinical symptoms as "scient."
The score system also needs to be verified in future clinical practices and studies.
As a cover, we hope that more evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
To be diagnosed with the "unexposed case" and the confirmed case, we recommend following and following the latest directions in each country.
Our team will also renew our guidance time and again.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to CVID 19th, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to CVID 19 days that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in one day because of the virus.

The transport of basic necessities -- medical, fuel, and food -- still allowed.
The first - known COVID infection in Bangladesh is on March 8, on two new arrivals from Italy as well as one of them.
On March 19, the three were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds a million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 directly exceeds one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with the CVID 19th, the disease caused by the crown virus.
The peak occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed his first crown virus infection and Zambia had his first death related to the crown virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country was one of the few countries that remained free from the infection of the crown virus.

ALDI also applied one limit, sir, on Monday.
This border was announced as a message in the register and on the Facebook page of its network.
The buyer is reported to store supplies due to fear of COVID when people have to do independent isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricts the purchase of toilet paper to send home to one order.
This change follows the restraint of four packs of transactions previously applied to Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March.
On his media statement on March 8, Coles reported that by doing the restrictions of the four packs, "many stores are still out in an hour since the delivery," and he called that request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unpredictant".
One last week, according to one of Woolworths' speech providers.
Costco shop in Canberra also restricts the amount allowed until two weeks ago.
To avoid doubt, Coles ordered more packages than masks and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI prepared for special Wednesday events available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, director of the Australian Justice Association, said that the peripheral tried to improve supplies, but local government limits for truck delivery made it difficult.
He anticipated increased production costs, while the supplier tries to fulfill the request, and a little more special promotion.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of taking off supplies early, some stores cannot hold special Wednesdays.
In a news.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, professor of Queensland University of Technology, says the store fills supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet tissue was a large volumed item so that the amount of supplies was low and, when it was sold out, built a lot of empty space on the shelfs so that the expectation of goods grew.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet tissue and navigation can be [of purchase] and there's a large amount of money, panic might be eliminated, however, Zimmerman's through the ABC News Department.
The production of the toilet toilet tissue re-surreng Who Gives said on Wednesdays ago that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Tisu Toilet Kleenex, and Solas Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed them work 24/7 to keep supply, according to News report.com.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some property dealers offer free toilet paper to the first bidder in Melbourne, when fewer auctions are held because buyers take the pause for a long holiday break.
This Thursday NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of the brush meant to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores actually refused to apply the limits, according to the Australian ABC report on March 3, they said that they didn't plan to apply the purchase limit.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, supplies, dry foods, laundry, and flour.
Likewise, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British Academy of Ocado was observed restricting the purchase of Andrew's toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID 19 as a password
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the CVID epidemic that was taking place-- the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Grandl - as a bid.
Although the word "data" refers only to how wide the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO records the need to encourage the government to act:
All the countries can still change the voyage.
If countries detect, test, handle, isolate, and mobilize their people as respond, say Tedros Adhanom Ghebreresus, Director of WHO.
We are very concerned about the level of concern, or the level of concern.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center and Prevention of the U.S. Disease, this occurred "never before."
He said, in the record published in the February of CNN, "in addition to influencenza, no respiratory channel virus has ever been traced from its appearance to the ongoing global preaching. "
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We've never seen a stain triggered by the crownvirus."
He continued, "and we've never seen a basis that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status of Pandemia followed WHO’s decision in January that declared this plague a global estate.
Director National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "the outbreak, this plague will get worse."
Until Thursday, Assocated Press reported there are at least 126,000 cases of CVID in the world, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The passing Kolvirus 201920 is the next 2019 malavirus (COVID) drug disease component and caused by acute acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The plague was identified in Watan, China, in December 20,19, as a World’s Health Care Center on January 30, 2020, and was declared aend on March 11, 2020.
Up to April 1020, about 1,61 million cases of CVID 19 have been reported in 210 countries and the most authorial region, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
Around 27,000 people have recovered.
The fatal number of cases is estimated 4% in China, while all over the world ranged from 13,04% to 08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms cover fever, cough, and breath out.
Compitions can cover pneumia and acute breathing syndrome.
Time from exposure to symptoms in general about five days, but it can range from two to fifteen days.
There are no known vaccines or specific analytic treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomary and pioneer therapy. Preventive actions that are recommended covering hands, closing their mouth while coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and independent isolation for people who are suspected to be infected.
Governments around the world have responded by using travel boundaries, quarantines, curfews, danger control at work, and facility closings.
It has led to serious global economic chaos, extreme delay or change of cultural, political, religious, political, political, political, political activity, exercise, and widespread awareness of the supply of things that are covered with panic purchases.
Schools and schools have been closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, which affects approximately 99.4 percent of students worldwide.
Misinformation of this virus has spread online and there is an incident of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with offspring and appearance of East and Southeast Asia, and people who come from the area with significant virus cases.
As a result of travel and heavy closings, air pollution and carbon emissions are dropping.
Health authorities in Wanti, Chinese capital Hubei, reported claims that the pneumnia case was unknown on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was done at the beginning of January 2020.
Those cases are mostly related to the Memorial of the John Sea Food People, and therefore the virus is thought to have a zootic origin.
The virus that caused the plague is called SARS-CoV-2, a new virus found and swept with the crownbarrus bat, the milling crown, and the SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms later known to be sick on December 1, 2019, and the person had no clear link to the market claims that were mentioned later.
Among the claims that were reported in December 20,19, two-three were found to have a connection with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unexpected report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to the 17th of November 20,19, on a 55-year-old from the Hubei province, was probably the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reportedly dropped in China, but suddenly rose in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China has crossed a new number of cases in Chinese for the first time.
There may be a large number of reported cases, especially among people with fewer symptoms.
Until February 26, relatively few cases reported between young men, with 19 years of age and 19 to form 2.4% of cases around the world, the head of British scientific adviser Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population need to be infected before the group's immune.
The case refers to the number of people who have tested COVID 19 and whose results have been confirmed positive according to official protocol.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policy not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A research published in March 16 found that in China, up to 23 January, it was estimated that 86% of COVID infection is not detected, and that an undisputed infection is a source of infection for 79% of the case being compromised.
A statistics project published on March 30, estimates that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be bigger than the reported case.
The initial estimate of basic reproductive numbers (R0) for COVID 19 is 1,4 to 2.4.
A study published by U.S. Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number may be 5.7.
Most people of CVID are cured.
For those who are not healed, time from the development of symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been associated with the COVID 19th.
In China, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths occur in people over 60 years old and 75% had a previous health disorder, which covered the disease and diabetes. The official estimate of death of COVID is generally referred to to in terms of a dead who gave a positive test for CVID according to official protocol.
The actual fatality of COVID may be much higher, given an official number of people who die without being tested, for example, at home, at the home of the care house, dsb.
The partial data of Italy discovered that the excess number of deaths during the Memorial exceeds official COVID deaths with factor 4-5 times as much.
A female spokesman for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number," a statement strengthened by the nonnimymic report about the excessive calculations in the U.S.A.
The first death outside the mainland occurred on February 1, the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
Until February 28th, out of China, more than dozen deaths recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and territial regions have reported deaths in every continent, except Antarctica.
These numbers vary according to areas and times, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of health care, the treatment options, the time since the first plague, and the character of the population such as age, sex, and health as a whole. The rate of death to the case reflects the number of deaths being diagnosed in a specified interval of times.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death ratio on a global case is 6.0% (97.039/1.617204) by April 10204.
These numbers vary according to the territory.
In China, the estimate of death rate on the case declined from 17.3% (for people with a show of 1-10 January 2020) to zero (for people with a dose of symptoms after February 1, 2020). Another rate covers the fatality of cases (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who died of a certain disease, and the fatality of infection (IR), which reflects the rate of the disease (IFR), which shows the percentage of people are infected and not diagnosed with certain diseases.
These statistics are not bound on time and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of hiccups have tried to count these numbers for a particular population.
Between Edence-Baded Medicine University of Oxford estimated the fatality of infection for the entire count of 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of these estimates is along with the results of the first random testing for COVID 19 in Germany and a statistics that analyze the effects of marketing on CFR estimate.
WHO confirms that this academy can be controlled.
The top and final duration of this plague are unclear and may be different according to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states: "Never controlled, even infectious outbreak is usually frozen and then started to drop when the disease runs out of the host.
But it's hardly possible to make a rational projection right now about when it happens."
The senior medical counseler of China's Chinese government said that "this plague might end June" if the entire country can be manipulated to follow WHO's advice about steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17th, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiene & Petroical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will go on, possibly up to a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other steps will be necessary "until vaccines are available (in course 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University states, "I guess it's little possible that this crownvirus, because it's very easy to be manipulated, it can disappear all over" and this disease may change into seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The recurring response will depend on group immunity and mutate levels.
COVIDS may be relatively specific and infected people can be without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, breathing snail production (fllegma), loss of touch, breath loss, joint pain and muscle pain, headaches, headaches, sweat, diarrhea, diarrhea, or synosis. WHO states that about six people get sick and have trouble breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms covering breathing problems, chest pressure or chest pain, sudden confusion, traffic problems, and panic in the face and lips; medical attention is immediately advised that these symptoms appear. increasing illness can be severe pneumonia, my respiratory syndrome, septic disease, septic disease, and death.
Some infected people may be assytomatics, that is, without clinical symptoms, but with tests that confirm infection, researchers recommend that those who are connected with infected people should be tested closely and checked to ensure their infection.
The Chinese estimate asimtomatic ratios range from a few to 44%.
The period between infection and awitts is usually between 1 and 14 days, at most than 5 days. For example, the estimated number of people who lost their first 30% smell, then fall to 15%.
The details of the way this disease is spreading are still being studied.
The COVID Service is believed to occur especially during close contact and through a small drop produced during coughing, crying, or talking; close contact is a contact within 1 to 2 feet [2 to 6 m] (3 to 6 feet).
A study found that unresponsed coughs can cause the loss of a quarter of five feet [4.5 m] (15 m) to 8.2 feet (27 m).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be transmitted by a tiny compound that lasts longer in the air and produces when it's spoken.
Drolets can fall in the mouth or nose of the person who's near him or may break into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as introducation and lung resusciation, can create acres of breathing to become aerosol and then spread through the air.
The ministry can also happen when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the newlyes, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government dropped the possible possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission in real-oral.Virus in the first three days after awitt symptoms, although the preaching may occur before the symptoms are visible and at an advanced rate of disease.
People give positive results to three days before symptoms show that transmissions may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few reports are confirmed in the lab, but assytomatic transmission has been identified by some countries when contact tracking investigations were confirmed.
European Disease Control Center (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easy it is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others. This virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for three days on plastics and steels under 304, one day on the cardboard, and over four hours on copper.
However, it is different to depend on the heat and temperature, and other animals and animals have been tested positive COVID 198.
There is no evidence that animals can infect humans, even though the British authorities suggest that they wash their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have been touched by an infected person.
The Konsavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people related to censor case acute respiratory disease in Whatter.
All new features of SARS-CoV-2 virus associated with the crownvirus in nature. Apart from the human body, it can be destroyed if it's exposed to household soap, which destroys its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 closely associated with the early SARS-CoV.
The virus is estimated to have a zootic origin.
A genetic analysis reveals that the crownvirus is geneticly combined with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the Sarbecovirus (specient B) subgen together with two species of bats.
This virus has 96% in common at all levels of genom with other malvirus bat samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the gene sequence between the electric tenghoa virus and the human virus.
Up to this point, the comparison of the entire genom has found at least 92% of the genetic material between the milling crowns and SARS-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that the mill is the SARS-CoV-2 admirer.
Infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily by symptoms, but confirmation can eventually be performed through a transcripatory chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on infected scret or infected CT screening.
A study that compares with PCR to CT in WUBU shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many features of testing associated with pneumnia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as the first test in diagnosis of COVIDS."
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was released first on January 17th.
Testing using polymerase re-time chain reaction chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on breathing samples or blood.
The results are generally available in several hours to a few days.
Mostly, this test is done on nasofaring uses, but using throats can also be used, a number of labs and companies are developing a cerologic test that detects antibodi.
On April 6, 2020, not one of these syntheological tests proved accurate enough to approve of its use in wide.
In the U.S., the Abrahamic test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by identified labs.
The nature of radiographing features and synthetic synthetic synthetics in a symtommatic person includes the global scope of the lysymetric bits and there are no pleura efusitions.
The Italian Radibical Society is setting up international online databases for security findings on confirmed cases.
Because of a mixing with other infections such as deniovirus, PCR unresisted testing has limited specs in identifying COVID 198.
A major study in China compared the results of CTUT with PCR and shows that even though less specific for infection, more sensitive and more sensitive screening is that it is recommended to be a filter in an epidemic area.
The artificially based Neural control network has been developed to detect the virus's screening feature with radiograph and CT.
The strategy to prevent the transmission of this disease includes keeping good personal hygiene diligently, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, noses, or mouth before washing hands, and using tissues when coughing or sink and immediately dumping tissues into trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
These steps are also recommended to prevent transmission, and governments in various regions have restricted or encouraged to stop all absences to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak of the plague.
But the virus has reached a level of public scale in most areas in the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some members of the community don't know where or how they are infected.
The use of data sites from the government for this purpose has triggered a matter of privacy, by exiting the statement from Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations that call this sort of survey.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed to be used voluntarily, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts are working a private social solution, such as using Bluetooth to record the distance of the user to another cell.
Next, users will receive messages if they are close to someone who's on positive terms for COVID 198. See the misunderstanding of how to prevent infection; for example, wipe their noses and glums with the poor drug.
There's not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing his hands is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; and after washing their noses, coughs, or water.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by household soap that ruined its protective layer.
Further, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol - based hand mutilation with at least 60% alcohol content based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people not touch eyes, noses, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be installed using a number of solutions (in a minute of exposure to the synthesis for the rusty surface), including ettol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, system of hypercrotorium 0.1%, hydrogen perox %, and povidone-odine 0,2,5%.
Another pattern, such as cloordium cloord and calorhexin gluct, is less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is an unexpected COVID case or confirmed in public facilities, such as offices or children's raising areas, all such areas as offices, bathrooms, public areas, electronic equipment along like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote monitors, and ATM machines used by sufferers, must be infected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with elbows that are bent or use tissues when cough or sink, and then immediately remove tissues.
The surgical surgeon is recommended for a person who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit volume and distance the spread of the explicit chromats when speaking, talking, flowing, and cough.
WHO has issued instructions about time and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the master can reduce people’s inclination to touch the face with unwashed hands, which is a source of major transmission."
WHO recommend the use of masks by healthy people only if they're at high risk, like people who take care of COVID 19 people, although WHO also admitted that using masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to drive masks to members of society.
In the United States, CDC recommended use of nonmedic face masks made of cloth. The Chinese specifically recommend the use of medical masks once used to a healthy society, especially when near (1 m) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommended surgical wear when using public transport or living in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia ordered its people to go out to public without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone who enters the store to wear a face mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear face masks while they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day from mid - March, requires railway passengers and urban buses to wear facial masks per April 1.
Panama requires the use of facial masks every time she goes out of the house, and it recommends making her own artificial masks for those who can't buy facial masks.
The facer is also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restrictions (also called physical restrictions) are an act of infection control intended to slow down the spread of disease by avoiding contact between individuals.
Social restrictions include quarantine; traveling restrictions; and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can apply social restrictions by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding public areas, using a greeting without contact, and maintaining physical distance from others.
At present, many governments are obligated or dominated by social restrictions in the region that are at peace with the outbreak of the plague.
The maximum number of people gathered that were recommended by the U.S. government bodies and health organizations quickly reduced, starting out of 250 people (if not known the CVIDs in a region) became 50 people, and then it became 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany forbade a meeting in the public area involving more than two people. Lansia and people with medical conditions based on diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immune systems that had serious health risks and higher complications were recommended that the CDC could be used to live in areas where possible. At the end of March 20.
The use of the term "so - called social limitations" implies that people have to isolate themselves completely and do not encourage people to stay in touch with others through alternative ways. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the fall.
This attendance includes encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or virus symptoms.
Personal isolation at home is recommended for those who are diagnosed with CVID 198 and people who are suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have provided detailed instructions for proper independence, many governments obligate or recommend independent quarantine for all populations who live in peaceable areas.
The most strict independence instruction was issued for people who were among the high - risk groups.
People who may be exposed to CVID 19th and those who are recently traveling to country or region by the vast COVID message are advised to perform independent quarantines for 14 days since the last possible time of exposure.
The strategy in the control of the plague is protection or expression, as well as exposure.
The removal was done at the early stage of the plague and was intended to track down and isolate the infected person and do other steps for infection control and vaccination that intended to stop the spread of disease to the entire population.
When there's no way to take care of the disease, the next effort moves to the degree of my education: these steps are taken to slow down the preaching work and reduce its effects to the health and society health care system.
The combination of the search and the design can be done at the same time.
Suprei needs more extreme steps to reverse the academy by reducing the basic reproductive number into less than 1. The role of the disease management is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, known by the outbreak of the epidemic orbit.
This lowers the risk of a loss on health care and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Intervention of nonfarmari to handle the plague includes individual precautions, such as hand hygiene, using face masks, and independent quarantine; steps at society's levels that are intended for physical restraint, such as closing schools and canceling mass meetings; society's involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and steps in environmentally, such as cleaning of the surface.
Other countries also apply steps that are intended to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduces mass and local quarantines, and warns about the movement of infected people.
Singapore gives financial support for infected persons who do independent quarantine and wear large fines for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases facial production and executes medical supplies. Simulation for Britain and the United States shows that my interpretation (employment, but does not stop the spread of an epidemic) and subpression has a great challenge.
A highly respected method can reduce the peak request for health care by 2/3 and death until half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and a slow health system.
Supression can be selected, but it takes protection during the virus is still on human population (or until vaccines are available), because if this is the first accomplished, the transmission will jump back quickly during the steps of the expression.
Long-term events to press the academy have an impact on social and economics.
There are no specific drugs approved for COVID 199, but development efforts are being made, which include existing drug testing.
Presuming free flu drugs, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depends on the level of enlightenment, oxygen therapy, intravention fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can make the patient worse.
Some previously approved compounds for another virus disease treatment are being examined for use in treatment of COVIDS.
The WHO also states that some of the " traditional medicine and housing" can ease symptoms caused by SARS-CoVim.
WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting health care for patients needs COVID 19 is the basic step in responding to the outbreak.
ECDC and European WHO office have provided guidelines for hospital and primary health services to divert resources in various levels, including focusing lab services for the COVID testing, if possible to cancel electromagnetic procedures, separate and isolate positive patients of COVID8, and improve intensive care by training personnel and increasing the number of vents and beds.
There are theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patients).
The first known Grandvirus case was traced to December 1, 2019 in Wanti, Hubei, China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Santoan Sea Food Center, which also sells living animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has the origin of zoonotics.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the London Center told their colleagues about "coronavirus like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenhang, were warned by the police for spreading false villages, and others, Ai Fen, was counseled by his superiors for warning.
The City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31, and told WHO.
Quite a number of reported pneumonia cases are reported to the health authorities in Wbara, which then triggered an investigation in early January, at the beginning of the plague, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-in January 2020, the virus spreads to other Chinese provinces, supported by foreign - year migrations and because Wurtan was the main transport center and railway transit.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.
About 200 countries and territial regions have at least one case.
Because of the academy in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area limit free movement and make border controls.
On April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, are in some kind of domestic quarantine, more than 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world are in some kind of local quarantine, which increases to 2.6 billion people two days later, about one third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed COVID case can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wur; one unrespoiled report showed the earliest case on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed the claims of Pneumony with an unknown cause on 26 December; this observation revealed his hospital to the CDC Jianghan in December 27.
The initial genetic testing of the patient sample on December 27, 2019 indicates that a crownvirus is similar to SARS.
Public announcements were released by the Sturan City Health Commission on December 31th.
WHO was told on the same day.
When this notice was carried out, the doctor in Whutan was warned by the police because of the "mass-desus" of the plague.
The Chinese People's National Health Commission at first claimed that there is no "distinct" proof of human transmission to man.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later explained by the secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jining as the "military War" to wipe out the virus spread.
In quarantine called "the biggest quarantine in human history", cordon sanitaire or cleaning restrictions announced on January 23 to stop the journey in and out of Whist, and extend to the total 15 cities in Hubei, which affects the total number of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is banned in the city.
The New Year’s Festival of Imek (F. 25) was canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced temporary hospital construction, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built after that, Leshenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospital, China also turned 14 other facilities in Whadan, such as convention and stadium centers, into a temporary hospital.
The whole university and school in the country is also closed.
Hong Kong and Maku area applied a few steps, especially in school and university matters.
Steps to work from the distance applied in some areas in China.
Travel restrictions were carried in and outside Hubei.
Common transports are modified and museums throughout China are temporarily closed.
The control of public movements is applied in many cities, and an estimated 760 million people (over half the population) are facing some restrictions outside the home.
For example, Beijing ran a 14-day quarantine for all international tourists who entered the city on March 23, the only case of land-compared China in the country five days earlier, in this case through a tourist who returned from Istanbul.
On March 24, 20, 2020, the Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of a case in the country was basically blocked and the plague was controlled in China.

Iran's health government announced Friday worship in the consummed regions and places of worship and then closed, while the Saudi Arabs had forbidden foreign pilgrimages and its inhabitants to the sacred places of the Crit and the Caribbean.
It has caused the most significant disturbance of the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major sports events are canceled or postponed, including the Champions League 20192020, the Premier League 201920, the EUFA Euro20, the 2020th century NBA 2020, and the NHL season 2020.
This plague messed up the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "re finalized until after 2020, but wouldn't be more than 2021."
This causes many players to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites report a significant increase in new registration. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delay or cancels the concert.
A lot of big theaters like Broadway also delay all the show.
Artists explore various ways to continue producing and sharing work through the Internet as alternative to traditional live shows, such as online live - online broadcast concerts or create a web based on artists to perform, spread, and publish their works.
A lot of Internet networks are being spread out by many people who move to humor and distraction in the middle of uncertainty.
Since the expansion of the COVID 19th, there has been increased prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the descendants of China and East Asia, and against people from the opposing region in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Fear terror, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia-Pasific region.
The report from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) recorded the following following premonitions in different groups around the world that Chinese people deserve viruses or accept what they claim to be worth the reward.
Some countries in Africa also have an increase in anti-tocrat sentiment.
Many of the people of Whutan and Hubei reported discrimination because of the origin of their region.
There's been support for the Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in the region that are covered with viruses.
Following the progress of the outbreak of the outbreak of the plague to new Hotspot countries, the Italians, the first European state in Europe, can also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed the petition to prevent the Chinese from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, Tagar #ChineseDontComeTonan becomes an trend in Twitter.
The Chinese and other Asians in Britain and the United States reported an increase in racist abuse and assault rates.
U.S. President Donald Trump is criticized for calling the crownvirus as "Virus Chinak", the term that critics consider racist and anti-toctect.
The players in Ukraine are attacking buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigns evacuated from What to Novi Sanzary.
Students from East India, bordered by China, and studied in the big cities of India are reported to have been infected with the coronaviral plague.
The President of the Formsaya Janata state unit at the West Dibslip Ghosh claims that China has destroyed nature and "that's why God avenges them."
The statement was then condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "keliru". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Tionghoa are supported by a deserter, with a stranger described as "stacking foreign" and being targeted for "along."
Many newspapers using payment have removed it for part or all of their coronavirus lips.
Many scientific publishers make a scientific project of outbreak - related outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share the results quickly on the prestub server, like bioRxiv.

lab testing for coronavirus 2019 (COVID) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes a method that detects the existence of the virus and detects antibodis produced as response to infection.
The existence of the virus in the sample confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects Grandvirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus detect real.
This test is used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibodi analysis can be used to diagnosis and survey population.
Antibodi tests show the number of people who are infected, including those whose symptoms are too light to report or who are without symptoms.
The number of deaths of accurate diseases and the immune levels of the population in the population can be determined by the results of this test.
Because of limited testing, until March 2020, no country has a real data on virus prevention in its population.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there's a huge variation in the number of tests that have been done by the countries.
This variation may also have significant effects on the fatality of reported cases, which may well be counted too high in some countries.
Using a real-time polymersion chain reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction, this test can be performed on a respiratory sample acquired by various methods, including the use of nasofaring or sputum samples.
Mostly, results are available in hours to two days.
A RT-PCR test done on throat users is just reliable during the first week of the disease.
In time, the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to apply in the lungs.
As alternative, for an infected person who was tested on the second week, sample material can be taken from the inner airway by using an insert or material produced through coughs can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using polymeration chain reactions to real-time (rRT-PRCR), and forming at least 250,000 tests to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Britain also developed testing on January 23, 2020. The South Korean company of Kogenebolech developed an SARS-CoV-2 detected device based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) that was a telesic on January 28, 2020.
This device is looking for the "E" gene that has all the blizzards, and gene RDRp specifically for SARS-COV-2. In China, the Grups are one of the first companies to receive an emergency use of the state-procturation of the National Medical Medical Association for SARS-CRDODODODS-CDODDDDDS and Disease Control center (C) from the New World-CVVVVBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBA-GABBBBBBA).
One of the three genetic tests in the old version test device provides no convincing results of reagen error, and the amount of testing in the CDC in Atlanta is limited; it resulted in less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components are considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and then the state lab and local labs are allowed to test.
This test was approved by the U.S. Department of Medicine and Food based on emergency usage. The U.S. commercial lab began testing early in March 2020.
March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the COVID test supplies based on RT-PCR on national scale.
Similarly, Diagustas Diagnos's Quest made the CVID 19th test available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No supplementary boundaries announced; gathering and processing must be done according to CDC terms.
In Russia, the CVID 19th test was developed and produced by the Virology State Research Center and the Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by Federal Service for the Researchal Care Care. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to develop tests to detect CIVID infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Digustross accepted his approval for testing of hours with high volume so that one machine could perform some 4.128 testing within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the yurumí issued emergency authorization (EA) to Abbott Laboratary to test on the m20 Abbott system; the earlier pointed out the same authorization to Hologic, Laorp Lar, and Thermo Fisher Scientist.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an ECA from the Academy for tests that take about 45 minutes.
The problem has been approved by testing that uses analyphilized isoteral acidic acids that are not PCR.
Because there is no need for a series of temperature change cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are now about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott anticipated to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monocal antibodical antibodi which specifically bind the nucleus (protein N) new crowns are being developed in Taiwan, with hope to give results in 15 to 20 minutes like a quick delay test.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "the photo of the jars has a small diagnosis value at the start stage, as well as a CT discovery [tomputation text] may already exist before a show of symptoms."
Special feature on CT includes ground-glass multilobar oats if it's with peripher distribution, assitories, and posters.
Subpleura Domination, crazy memory, and console is formed as a result of the development of disease.
In What, a study that compares PCR to CT at the present destination indicates that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many features of mixing matches with pneumony and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as first test for diagnosis of COVIDS." In March 20,20, the CDC recommended PC for initial filtering.
Part of the immune response to infection is an antibodi development involving IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals since about 7 days after the symptoms, to determine the immune to the disease, and in the population survey. The testing can be done in the central lab (CLT) or by testing point-of-care (POCT) points.
The automatic system with high results in many clinical labs will be able to do this check, but its supplies will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT, it is commonly used with a peripher blood specimen, although a series of specimens can be used to follow an immune response.
For PoCT, it's usually used a peripher blood specimen obtained through skin pricks.
Unlike the PCR method, the extract step was not necessary before the inspection. On March 26, 2020, the Memorial mentioned 29 agencies that provide notice to the agencies as necessary and therefore are now able to distribute their antibodi tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test that has been approved by an authorization on emergency use. At the end of March 20, 2020, Euroimmun Medical Labotosturary Diignorics and Epitope Diignos had a approval of Europe for their test tools that could detect antibodi Ig and IgA against the virus in the blood sample.
The testing capacity up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than the conventional PCR check on the virus RNA.
Antibodi was usually detected 14 days after infection.
Hong Kong designed a schedule for the unexpected patient to stay at home, "departement emergency emergency will give the patient a speed tube," they spit into it, send it back, and get a test results some time later. The United States announced that NHS is pioneering the unexpected case scheme in the home so that if they come to the hospital or test an ambulance should be used for the unexpected case of COVID, a professional will take the test that will be the case.
The South Korean testing center has helped us to do the fastest and highly-distribution tests of any country.
The cost of health insurance is required if a doctor is asked.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 110,000 tests a week.
On March 19th, test was offered in some large cities.
March 26, 2020, the number of tests performed in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first lab survey revealed that, in Israel, researchers at the Technion Hospital have been tested until and between the weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples, positive samples for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Hospital and Rambambaon have been tested and tested the method to test tests of 64 patients at the same time, by uniting a sample of positive samples.
With its construction monitored by the founder of Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the organizer shows that the case in Hubei can be 47% higher and the cost of quarantine treatment could be twice as much if this test capacity did not exist.
At once followed by Huo-Yan lab at Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in all 12 cities across China.
March 4, 2020, a total of its daily capacity as much as 50,000 tests a day. multiple open sources are released by Origami Assays can test as much as 1,222 patients for COVID are concerned with just 93 checks. This balanced design can be performed in a small lab without a need for robot fluid processing.
Until March, the lack and amount of reagens have become a slave to mass testing in the European Union, Britain, and the United States.
Because of this, some researchers have tried to explore sample processing protocols involving sample warming in 98 °C (08 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genom for further testing. On March 31, the Arab Union was reported to do more Grandviral testing per member of the population than any country, and ready to increase the scale of testing to reach most of the population.
It is achieved through the combination of screen testing and the purchase of mass-product labs while the population of the 42 and 18th group (deared on the emergency analysis lab "Huo-Yan" in China).
Raised in 14 days, this lab is capable of doing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first lab to have this scale out of China.
Various tests that target various parts of the progenital profile are developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
World Health Organization adopts German prescriptions for the production of test devices sent to low - production countries without resources to develop itself.
The German regime was published on January 17, 2020; protocol developed by the U.S. Center of Disease Control was not available until January 28 to slow the tests available in the United States.
On the other hand, experts say that extensive testing supplies in South Korea help reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
Test capacity, mostly in private sector labs, was built within a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for the increased testing program as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID American academy. A high request for testing because of the vast virus’s spread caused hundreds of thousands of testing in the U.S. private lab, and the supply of applications and chemical reagens to become critical.
In March 2020, China reported an accuracy problem on their test tools.
In the United States, the test tools developed by the CDC had "cat"; the government then removed the berocracy barrier which prevented private testing. Spain buys a test tool from the Chinese Shenzhen Biesy Biechnology Co ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The company explained that false results may result from failure to collect samples or to use tests correctly.
The Spanish administration says that they're going to pull the equipment that gives the wrong results, and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Biesy.80% of the test that the Czech Republic of China had bought was not true. Slovakia bought 1.2 million tools from an undescilable Chinese test.
Prime Minister Matovč suggested that this test be thrown into the Danube River. Ate Kara from Turkey's Health Department said that Turkish test tools were bought from China's Chinese have "a high error rate" and they didn't use them. The United Kingdom bought a million tools from Chinese, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that this test could not be used.
Testing, followed by positive quarantines and tracking people with positive SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive end.
The analysis that works in the Italian Vono city, the first death site of COVID in Italy, was two rounds of testing on the entire population that consisted of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of a positive person has no symptoms, and all the cases found in quarantine.
With travel restrictions to this community, new infection is eliminated at all.
With aggressive contact tracking, accessing restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the crownr of 2020 in Singapore is growing much slower than other developed countries without extreme restrictions, such as the closing of restaurants and strict companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that people stay at the house on March 28, but the schools were opened again on time after the vacation on March 23.
Some other countries also handle onlines with aggressive contact trackings, entry restrictions, testings, and quarantines, but with non-stremed circuit quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A study of statistics found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower number of fatalities, perhaps because these countries are more capable of detecting people who have mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommend that countries lack testing capacity, and national labs with limited COVIDS experience, send five positive samples first COVIDS and ten negative samples to one of the 16 labs listed for confirmation testing.
Of 16 labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "% positive results" is influenced by the state's testing policy.
The country that only tests those who are treated at the hospital will have %'s more positive results than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with the same factor.
Washing hands, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning someone’s hands that intended to remove dirt, oil, microorganism, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain critical times throughout the day prevents the spread of many illnesses, such as diare and cholesterol, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also be infected with respiratory disease, such as control or cold, if they don't wash their hands before touching eyes, noses, or mouth.
Five critical days of washing hands with soap are: before and after taking the child's ass, after cleaning or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before preparing food or eating meat, fish, or raw purple.
If water and soap don't exist, hands can be cleaned with ashes.
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning out a kid who just used the toilet.
After cleaning noses, coughs, or sinks.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical cleansing refers to the practice of hygiene associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of washing hands is to clean up hands from pathogens, viruses, or other microorganism that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important to those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also important to the public.
Washing hands has a great deal of health benefits, including miscalculating the spread of influence, the crown virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of contagious diare; reduce respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality of the baby at home.
The resulting study in 2013, pointed out that the increased practice of washing the hands can gradually improve the high growth of children.
In developing countries, child mortality rates resulting from respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple act can reduce death rates from the disease to nearly 50%.
Interventions encouraging the washing can reduce the case of diarrhea to about one third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low - production areas.
48% of diare cases can be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent edre and acute respiratory infections, as the unconscious behavior done in homes, schools, and people around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of the number one death of young children; this disease causes deaths about 1.4 million children a year.
Dinere and pneumonia cause death nearly one million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and using toilets to become a standard that can save more lives than vaccines or any medical action, and reduce deaths death from diarrhea to nearly half and death from acute respiratory infections to quarter.
Washing hands are usually combined with other sanitation acts as part of the water program, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).
Washing hands also protects themselves from direct attachments through physical contact.
The small side effects of washing hands are frequently performed washing the skin can cause skin damage caused by skin laundering.
The research conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that washing overstilles can cause physical and physical skin conditions, known as hand or mictitious hand, especially among health - care officers.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsession-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times all day while washing hands with soap is important to reduce mentally transmitted diseases: before and after using toilets, after cleaning the child's ass, before feeding the child, before feeding and before preparing food or meat, fish, or raw pots.
Another time it is important to apply proper washing techniques to prevent disease transmission is before and after caring for wounds, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal shit or handling animals; and after touching the trash.
In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study of washing hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38, a dozen houses were typically washing their hands with soap. A 2014 Arabic study shows that there was the highest rate with 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle of 77 percent; and the Chinese bending at the lowest rate of 23 percent. Now it is possible to adopt behavioral behaviors with soap at critical times.
Medar Health Care program applied by the Philippines Department of Education is an example of appropriate timing action to support the child’s health and education.
A two-time worm drug offering, plus with washing hands every day with soap and brushing your teeth every day with fluorides, is the core of this national program.
The program was also successfully applied in Indonesia.
The cleansing of microorganism from the skin is reinforced with soaping or desergent to water.
The main work of soap and desergent is to reduce obstacles to solution and increase slowness.
The water is an incompetent skin cleaning because of fat and protein, which is a component of organic waste, not easily in water.
Even so, fat cleaning and protein were helped by enough water flow.
The solid ground, because its current state can be used, may contain bacteria obtained from earlier use.
A small number of studies that examine the transfer of bacteria from solid soap are contaminated conclude that transfers cannot happen because they're used as a bacterium.
Even so, the CDC kept saying, "The drop of the liquid from the container without being touched better."
The antimacles are greatly encouraged to health - conscious society.
Until now, there has not been evidence that the use of anti -ceptics or recommended use of the recommended antibiotics in nature is better for organisms that survive antibiotics in nature.
However, antimateri soap contains a common antibirical agent such as tricks, which has a list of highly held organisms.
So even though antibiotic exhibits are not targeted by antimatter soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is.
In addition to phakat and skin support, advanced formulation may contain acid (aceat, acorat acid, lactic acid) as pH, synthetic acid as active anti-microba acids, and more skin exercise (ciently, vitamin, flavor, extra plant). A composite analysis of Facient Health University Health shows that soap is as effective as the same as antic soap of antiictrobailic acid that contains a trick in the brain and prevents from the disease.
Nice hot water for washing hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteri grows faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm water is more effective than cold water, which is covered in eliminating natural oil that holds away dirt and bacteria.
However, in contrast with the belief of many, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing microba in the hand.
Hand or analyphistication is an un water - based cleaning agent.
At the end of the 1990s and early 21st century, a hand - servile agent of an unseasoned alcohol-based drinker (also called alcohol - based driver, an antiseptic driver, or hand-divation) began to be known.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on alcohol support or intanols that are combined with a commercial material like Carbomer or with glycets like glycerin to be used and to reduce the effects of the effects of alcohol.
The added hydrogen peripherics increase further antimicroba activity. The intervention of hands containing at least 60-5% alcohol is an efficient mite killer.
Puscination of alcohol kills bacteria, bacteria that hold on to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, multiple viruses (the HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinov builtinus, vaccinus, vaccinia, poisoning and hipatis), and mushrooms.
Alcohol management that contains 70% of alcohol kills 99.94 (possed log range, similar to 30 seconds of bacteria in the hands of 30 seconds after use and 99% to 99,999% (the log range 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands of one minute after the use. The most effective hand of bacteria and less effective using them to several viruses.
Alcohol - based hand management is almost entirely ineffective to nonrovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause for infectious gases. Antiseptics or alcohol users in adequate amount must be used to soak or cover two hands completely.
The front and back of two hands and in the frames and the ends of all fingers were rubbed about 30 seconds to fluid, meat, or dry gel.
The fingers must also be washed well by brushing them in two palms. The U.S. Centers of Diseases are more encouraging to wash their hands instead of combaters, especially when the hands look dirty.
Keeping it up to use the application of the research agency for quick use and activity of homicides against microorganism; however, the developments agent should not be used as a substitute for proper washing hands, unless soap and water are not available.
Alcohol - based hand management can often cause dry skin, except if the emolyent and/or the skin was added to the formula.
The effects of drying from alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other emolyne to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol - based hand mutilation causes irritation and skin drought much lower than soap and antimicroba deternation.
Aggressive contact contact contact contact contact contact, urtic syndrome, or hyperstivity towards alcohol or substance in the alcohol folder’s hand rarely occurs.
Lower spirit causes disturbing contact to be the appeal of this product than washing your hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't clean their hands from organic material, but only consult it.
For this reason, hand cleaning is not as effective as soap and water as preventing the spread of pathogens because pathogens are still in the hands.
Alcohol - free personality intimacy depends heavily on its materials and formulations, and according to history, this product is particularly paleer than alcohol and alcohol abuser.
Recently, the formulation that uses crayalconcoride coride has proved to have constant and progressive antimicroba activity after use, not like alcohol, which proved to be reduced after repeated use, maybe due to progressive side effects.
Many people in a low - production community cannot afford soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Abu or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the worries is that if contaminated with microorganism, land or ashes might increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ashes are agents of deinfect because, if contact with water, ashes will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommend ashes and sand as alternative soap when soap is not available.
The correct washing technique based on U.S. Disease Control Care for disease prevention includes the following steps:
Keep your hands covered with warm or cold water flowing.
Water flows because the silent bus may be contaminated, while water temperature seems to have no effect.
Get your hands covered with lots of soap, including the backs, on the fingers, and under the nails.
Sabun picked up the brush from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more closely when using soap than using water.
Joy at least for 20 seconds.
Squeezeing into a lump, which helps remove the skin from the skin, and rub it out for longer.
A carefully placed water under the flow.
Immobilizing in the coms can make hands contaminated again.
Dry with dry magic or let it dry in the air.
Wet hands and tastes are more likely to be re-insplanated, areas that often miss their thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and nails.
The designed nails and whiskers can save microorganism.
The heating rate is often recommended to keep hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection infection.
Low - quality options can be made to enhance hands when water is low and/or soap is not available, for example, flowing water from urgens or bottles that are hung and cuffed and/or uses ashes, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations when supplying limited water (like schools or rural areas in developing countries), there is a solution of water processing, such as "py-taps", and other low options.
The tippy is a simple technology that uses a water bottle hung with ropes, laces operating by foot to pour some water into the hand, and a soap.
Effective intervention is an important part of the process of hand hygiene, but there is a debate about the most effective form of handing in the general toilet.
The more research shows that the sheet of paper is much cleaner than that of an electric handring found in many toilets.
In 2008 a study was conducted by Westminster University, London, and sponsored by a more modern-day European paper industry of European Symposium paper, to compare the level of paper magic cleaning, warm air filtering, and the airporting of the jet.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, the total number of bacteria was found to rise at 194% in finger books and 254% in the palm of the hand.
Drying with jet air dryers caused the total number of bacteria average 42% in finger books and 15% in the palm of the hand.
After washing and drying hands with paper laps, the total number of bacteria is less than 76% in their fingers and 77% in the palm of the hand. Itlmuwan also makes testing to determine the potential of the cross-inclination on other toilet users and toilet environments due to each type of filtering methods.
The jet air filter, which cuts the air from a unit at 180 m/s (650 km/8; 400 pm), can blow microorganism from hand and unit and possibly corrupt other toilet users and the area of toilets up to six feet [2 m].
The use of warm air filtering spreads microorganism to 0.25 feet [0.25 m] from the drying.
Paper rate shows no significant microorganism. In 2005, the study conducted by TekV Produt und Umwelt, various methods of hand-reserving are reviewed.
After handring, the next number of bacteria was observed:
There's a lot of handring maneuvers, and handring has been compared to filtering by using a paperflake.
Washing our hands using hand-conservation tissue is an alternative as long as there is no soap and water.
Alcohol - based hand mutilation must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical washing was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered his effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing illness in the hospital environment.
There's an electronic device that provides the bait to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection is down with the use of the device.
Medical baths were performed for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in plenty or gels to purify and rub each part of the hand.
Hands have to be combed by each other with the fingers of each other.
If there's dirt under the nails, the fur brush can be used to remove it.
Because the germs can survive in the water that is in the hands, the hands need to be carefully cleaned and dried up with clean magic.
After dry, paperflakes are used to turn off the liquids (and open the exit if necessary).
This act avoids recontamination of the surface.
The purpose of washing hands in health care is to eliminate pathogens and avoid the transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of washing hands is still on levels that cannot be accepted in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forget how to wash their hands before touching the patient so that it infects microorganism.
One study suggests that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can lower the rate of blood infection related to the blood count to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published the written page that shows the standard of washing hands and applause in the health - care sector.
The concept of WHO's hand hygiene can also be seen on his website for public comments.
The relevant review by Whitby is al.
The commercial device can measure and evacuate our hands if a demonstration of obedience to the rules is necessary.
The World Health Organization has the time to wash the hands:
Once it's turned into blood.
Before the task accepted, and
After the treatment of the patient, adding antiseptic chemicals to soap or "antimicroba") is working to kill the washing material.
The kill function may be wanted before surgery or the situation when the antibiotic organisms are so common. For 'to negotiate' their hands before surgery, need a direct and shut down without touching, chorphyphyxidin or yodium, chem to dry their hands after washing, and sterical brush to brush and other surgical instruments to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be released.
This procedure is washing hands and arms down to the elbows, usually 2–6 minutes.
It's not necessary for long-term driving time (10 minutes).
When it turns, the water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After we finished washing our hands, hands were dried and crushed with steric cloth and a surgical garment was put on.
To reduce the preaching of the crew, it would be better to wash your hands or use hand control before and after dealing with the sick.
For the control of staffic infection at the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands came from the first 20% of laundering, and that additional benefits were obtained very little while the frequency of hand cleaning is increasing over 35%.
Washing with regular soap leads to more than three times as much of an infection infection transmission to food than washing with anti-tacteric soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol - based hands to reduce a H1N1 - based virus and Cloveridium from hand. Intervention to improve hand hygiene in health - care fathers may require an education for the staff about washing hands, improving alcohol - based hand - based supplies, and written reminders to staff.
It takes more research to know the most effective interventions in various health - care settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic way that reduces the cost of good health and even good nutrition.
Yet, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or laundry facilities in the homes of residents, schools, and places of work made the target target of the behavior of universal hands become a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, washing hands near private toilets or public toilets is rare, although the options are not available to make cheap laundry.
In any case, the lower rate of washing can also occur because of the habits that have been embedded and not because of the lack of soap or water.
Training and encouragement washing hands with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and produce long - term behaviors.
To be effective, surveillance and evaluation required.
A systemic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in improving hands in LMIC, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of how to wash their hands at school is "The Three Stars" by UNICEF that drives schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, between other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are achieved, school can move from one star to finally three stars.
Building our hands can be part of a washing campaign that is done to reduce children’s disease and death.
The World Hand Day is another example of an increase campaign trying to achieve the purpose of behavior change because of the number of infected viruses 201920, UNICEF encourages the use of hand washing emoji.
Some studies examine the overall cost of washing hands in developing countries in connection with the Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the year that was lost in pain.
One survey shows that encouraging the washing of hands with soap is significantly more of a cost than the intervention of water and other sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable conditions, such as new birth mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two hand cleaners: Doctor Igria Igaz Semelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence, the first "disper of modern nursing" in England.
At that time, many still believe that infection was caused by the rotten smell called a miasma or bad air.
In the 1980 ’ s, a plague that was transmitted through food and infection associated with health care made the U.S. Centers of Diseases more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The pig flu plague in 2009 and the CVID 19th Memorial in 2020 increased awareness in many countries the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from the infectious disease.
For example, posters of "the proper washing of hands" were hung next to the sinks in the public toilet and in the toilets of office and airports in Germany.
The expression "clap out of" means declaring one's reluctance to take responsibility for something or to get involved in something.
The expression comes from the Bible chapter of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to dishonor Jesus Christ, but it has become a broad expression used in the British community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began washing her hands constantly to clean an imajiner stain; an act that showed her guilt for the evil she did and for persuaded her husband to do it.
It has also been known that after recalling or meditating on irrational actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate the equipment of their hands.
Further, those left to wash their hands after the reflection had smaller quids involved in the "cleaning," as volunteers.
Religion commands washing hands for clean and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, using water, but without soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual washing in many religions, including Bahá'í, Hindu, cavidah and Jadols in Jews, Lavabo in Islam. Religion has ordered the washing of hands to cleanse, especially after certain actions.
Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic religions are required to wash their hands after using toilets.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims required washing their hands before and after eating.
The risk control of the workplace for CIVID 19th.
The risk control of work for COVID 19 is a safety pathology and working health application for dangerous control of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID) disease prevention.
The right danger control at work depends on the location of work and job work, based on the risk assessment of papal sources, the rate of disease in society, and the risk of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID.
According to U.S. Security Administration, low - risk work has a minimum job contact with public and other employees; for this job, recommended basic infection measures, which include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay in the home if they are ill, breathing ethics, and cleaning and physical activity.
The risk job of exposure is involving work that requires close contact or often with strangers or is expected to suffer from COVID 19th, but it may be infected with transmission in society or international travel.
These groups include workers who have contact with public communities such as in schools, working environments with high population developers, and high volume system settings.
The danger control for this group, other than basic control measures of infection, includes ventilation using high - efficient air filters, protective against the vaccine, and providing protection when meeting people with COVID.
OSA considers health and morgues exposed to people who are known or expected to suffer high - rise COVID risk of exposure, which is greatly at high risk if workers perform aerosing procedure on, or take or handle specimens of, people who are known or expected to suffer from COVIDS.
The proper danger control of this worker includes engineering control, such as negative ventilation room and self - protection tools that fit the job.
The COVIDS plague can have some impact on the workplace.
The worker may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or because of fear of hardship.
Business patterns can change, either in terms of what they are asked or in how to get these things (like shopping out of busy hours, by sending, or setting).
In the end, sending items from the highly protected geography region of COVID 19 could be interrupted. The permission of the disease and the plans of infection may be used to guide the act of protection.
The plan considers the risk levels associated with jobs and jobs, including the sources of exposure, the risk factors resulting from home and community fathers, and the risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical condition.
The article also describes control that is necessary to overcome the risks and emergency plans for situations that might arise as a result of the plague.
The notions and plans for infectious illness may submit to national recommendations or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of the outbreak involves reducing the transmission among staff, protecting a person who is at greater risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and assessing bad effects on another entity in the supply chain.
The rate of disease in the community where business is affecting the actions of repeated care.
The danger control shark is a labor skeleton used in safety and working health to group danger control based on its effectiveness.
When the danger of COVIDS cannot be removed, most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative management, and the last protective device.
Technically control includes isolateing employees from the dangers associated with work without relying on the behavior of workers and being the most expensive solution to the cost to be applied.
administrative management is a change in job policy or procedure that requires work or employers ’ actions.
Self - defense (APD) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but it can help prevent some exposure.
All kinds of APD should be selected based on the danger of workers, installed properly just as they did (e.g., respirator), are consistently and correctly, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, clean, and kept properly or removed to avoid contamination.
According to U.S. Security Administration and Working Health, low - risk employment has minimal work contact with public and other employees.
These steps of basic infection that are recommended for all places of work include often washing hands thoroughly, encouraging workers to stay in the home if sick, breathing ethics include covering coughs and sinks, providing tissues and garbage containers, preparing work from distance or time to time for arrivals, if necessary, telling the workers not to use equipment and equipment, and doing regular cleaning and cleaning of work environments.
Quick identifying and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease should live at home until they are free from fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using a fever treatment or other symptoms, and that the hospital leave policy would allow employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and to know this policy.
According to OSHA, the risky job of having to include a job that requires close contact or often within six feet (1.8 m) to an unknown person or expected to suffer COVIDS, but it might be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of transmission in the community around the business location, or because someone new has made an international trip to a major COVID transmission.
These groups include workers who have contact with public communities such as in schools, working with high-ends, and high volume settings. The technique control for this group and high group involves setting up high-ended air filters, increasing vents, building physical barriers like cycling plastic Guards, and setting the drive-thru windows or setting up for the service. The management of this group and the potential support of this group involves pushing the staff to the home, turning off the virtual program to work with its high-ender's high-ending field, making up a field service calls for access to work, taking care of the office, and using the office support of employees, the office, and using the support, using the support of the latests of the preceding program, the office, the office, and the office of employees, the office, the office of the office, the office of the office, the office, and the office of the office, the office, the office, the office, the office of the office, the office, the office, the office of the office, the office of the office, the office, the office, the office, and the office of the office, and the office, the office, the office, the office, the office, the office, the office, the office, and the office, and the office, the office, the office, the office, and the office, the office of the office, the office, the office, and the office of the office, and the office, and the office of the office of the office of the office, and the office, the office, and the office, the office, the office, the office, the office, the office, the office.
The workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If one gets sick on a plane, the right control to protect workers and other passengers includes separating the sick one from another by six feet, pointing one cabin crew to take care of the sick, and offering a face mask for someone who is sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a scar when cough or a cough.
You cabins have to wear medical gloves once during the treatment of sick or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and maybe other protective tools if the sick passengers suffer fever, daily cough, or breathing trouble.
The hand and other items should be removed in a life bag, and the contaminated surface should be cleaned and explained to the ship, and for the fishing ship, and for other passengers, the danger control involves delaying the journey, dissolving the medical center, and informing the ship immediately if one has a fever or other symptoms on the ship.
Ideally, medical action was performed in a isolated cabin. In spite of the preaching work in society, for school and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short - term closings to clean or infected if an infected person has ever been in a school building.
If there are transmissions in society at minimum levels to the present, social restrictions can apply, which include: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, choir classes, or feeding in the cafeteria, improve the distance between the table, the time of the coming and the return, restricting visitors, and using a separate health location for children with symptoms like flu.
If there are high transmissions in local society, along with social restrictions, extending school closings can be considered. For law enforcement officers doing daily routine, health risks are considered low by the CDC.
The law enforcement officer who has to contact the confirmed or unexpected COVID 19 is recommended to follow the same guidance as emergency medical technicians, including using proper protective tools.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers have to clean up and infect belts and task supplies before they are used back with spray or household cleaning and following standard operating procedures to control and remove the former APDs and to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers health and morgues to be at high or very high rates of risk.
High - risk jobs include health care, support, lab, and medical transportation associated with known patients or suspected COVID 198.
This job became very high - risked if the workers performed aerosoling procedure on, or taking or handling specimens from, known patients or suspected COVID 19th.
Aerosol-making procedure covers intubs, rock-diversion procedures, bronkoccips, some procedures and tooth checks, or the specimens.
A high - risk job of a mornary room covering the workers involved in preparing a known person's body or expected a CVIDim case at the time of death; this job is very high if workers perform the autopsy. Additional techniques for this risk group include the isolation space for known or expected COVIDstian patients, including when the airline procedure was performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health - care settings and morgues.
Specsiment must be handled with the flight level level of Biology 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come apart into a different waiting room based on whether they expect the CVIDS case. In addition to other APDs, OSHO recommend respirators for people who work within 6 feet of known patients or expected to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, and people who perform social performance procedures.
In the United States, the N95-face cover respirator who approved NIOSH or better should be used in the context of written - cell protection programs that include considerations, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and increase the comfort of workers. The WHO does not recommend complete cover or coverall because COVIDS are respiratory diseases and not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO just recommended surgical masks for the football officer at the entrance point.
For those who take breathing specimens, tending, or transporting CVID patients without aerosol procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, facial shields, clothing, and gloves.
If aerosol-making procedure is done, the surgeons are replaced by N95 respirators or FFP2.
Since the APD supply is not sufficient enough throughout the world, WHO recommends the need for an APD through a long medical service, physical restrictions such as window contact, with only people involved in immediate care may enter the room containing COVIDS patients, use only APDs needed for certain tasks, continue using the same respirators without taking away when taking care of many patients with the same diagnosis, and monitoring the APD chaining and no longer using the symptoms.

BARIS SUBJEK: [CONDS] Set down the load and prepare the future
ANGGAL/ TIME OF FEAR: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LISNES: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in such a wonderful situation this month.
The COVID 19th Epidemia is the thing that makes clear the human nature of the global and the responsibility we have for each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and development of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've witnessed among all the fellow workers through emails, calls, and chats are an incredible confirmation of a great human being, which we're quite lucky enough to work with them.
My feeling of gratitude and pride can call you all as a fellow worker.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how much it means to the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how this is a strong symbol for this essential resource to remain available to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you keep the site running, help pay for our partner, or help keep our community's security.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially right now.
It's a moment when it's not just the work we do, but the way we do it will make the impact that it has to do with the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
The adjustment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenge we faced and the best way to maintain the survival of the organization during this time.
We really want to lose the pressure and support our mission for long term.
If you need to reduce the job schedule, it's okay.
For all staffs, contractors, and contract workers:
Our day - to - day work hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set up a day off, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
But the world cannot be interpreted right now, and whether you need to care for the loved one, shop for the basic needs, or go to a doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your worktime.
If you're sick, don't work.
This shouldn't be necessary to say, but we said it.
The illness or PTO is not necessary, enough to inform your manager and help your team pass the calendar and schedule to ensure the main field can be completed.
(If you're diagnosed positively suffering COVID 19 years, please tell Bryan in T 3.C Ops to help with support and make sure your situation gets the right attention of management.)
The ones whose pay is based on hours will be paid full.
We've said it, and said it once again, to honor our commitment to the contractors and staff based on hours.
Everyone will be paid according to their regular hours of work.
It includes you getting sick and you can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress against the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in these days.
Once again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what needs to be anticipated and can take appropriate action.
A certain job is considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security teams, among other things, do important work that may need additional support.
We'll start the process with all the departments to assess the current purpose and distract our focus to support essentials for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus fully on the most essential project.
Slowing down right now will be nothing for the future.
We don't plan on working late after this academy.
You will not be expected to work overtime to fulfill the current unrealistic time needs.
We realize that situations change and will try to set new targets and lines if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adjust to new realitys and expectations of the day's work hours, we're going to need to adjust the time line for the completion of the 2020-2021 Yearbook.
We mean to propose the length of 201920 plans that allow more time to make budgets so that employees can care about important jobs, self - care care, and the care of the loved ones while making their needs or wanting to work on a schedule less for the next few weeks.
The length of this time line greatly reduces the burden of work and the pressure of planning today throughout the organization.
We'll deliver our proposal to the council next week and we'll update the delegates and the team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thanks for the APP team for your leadership in this matter.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our friends based on SF may have been exposed to the COVID virus.
But because we're so worried, we hired the cleaning crew to infect all the surfaces in San Francisco's office.
They're using the liquids of the hospital to infect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
The building applies its own safety security protocol by using products that support its safety.
We're glad that the office will be ready to use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID protocol to us and all the staff members based on DC.
From last week, our DC's office moved to a long-disposed work order, along with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues based on NYC, we're also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still continuing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked from a distance for the first time.
Our long - term associate realized that it may need adjustments and they want to offer you advice:
The length of the meeting is the longest one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into a few days.
Defining a meeting clearly, making agendas, and sending literature previously.
Make video as default, with such tools as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate cooperation and direct connections.
Show leaders to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor conversation for questions and record a list of speakers, and someone to help create a meeting record (or make a cooperative record).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy small foods.
Join the channel #remoties in Slack to talk to a partner about the job shared
The SDM operation team is searching for web - based ingnomical guidance to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This week we asked all the funds we took to the community to cancel the public event that Wikimed Wikimedia, like Edit-a-thon, until WHO declared the bread had ended.
We tell them that we understand our request for revocation and other restrictions can make them impossible to complete the approved action and that no one will be given a pinal to delay or modify the target.
This next week we'll follow up with an additional guide on Wikimania and the conference of the regional community and other themes.
Generally, sentiment of the entire global community seems to be a sad result of this disorder, but it was both relieved of clarity and the ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Next, CRT is trying to prepare a page in Met-Wiki to provide room for communities to monitor our impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during KOVID situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and make time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all the essential information related to any other COVID 19th in Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We're also trying to keep regular communication with the staff who live in countries that are now especially at peace.
If you have questions about travel, show, main job area, or difficulty about lips, or other things that may need help, do not hesitate to tell and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and become a link to the needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judan, director of Global SDM International.
None of these changes are viewed as our job completion and obligation.
On the other hand, this change is an admission that, at present, our work and obligation may need to be adapted in ways that we have never done before.
This change is the steps we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need our movement, and give the world the services they're responsible for.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for the important work that will come in a few weeks and maybe a few months to come.
We need all of you to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work as well as you need it.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other team members (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby).
b' Eszim transformer 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell (cell cells) in lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity opposite to the enzim transformer dysin (ACE), reducing the amount of preciousin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), so making it a promising target to treat the disease. ACE2 also serves as a starting point in the cell for some mlvirus.
ACE2 of human versions is often called HACE2.
Enzim transformer Nertensin 2 is a metalloenzim containing a sleigree located on the surface of the endotel cell and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has the M2 p.2 p.P.ide terminal-N and the amino renal collustrin terminal-C domain.
ACE2 is a single type of I-like membrane protein, with an end to enzymely exposed on the surface of the cell in the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 extrasel domain separated by other enzymes, known as sheddase, and the terrupt protein produced into the blood stream and finally resorted into the urine.
ACE2 is in most organs: ACE2 attached to cell membrane primarily the type II lung alveol cells, interosit tiny intest Intest Intestines, the artery cell and the veins, and the poor muscle cells of the artery cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in serebral, striats, mortgages, and brain trunks.
ACE2 main function is as ACE developer.
ACE broke up the sentiment hormone I'm becoming a portrayin II Bascoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cut the acid amino ponlalanin terminal carboksil from N-Ap-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Phe) and hydro-Phesed it into a alwaysthetensin (1-7) vasaser (Hsp-Ag-Agg-Val-Is-Ile-HIle-H-OH-OH-OH-OH).
ACE2 can also split a number of other apps include [des-arg9] -bradiny, applein, neurotensin, dinophin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also organizes the flow of amino acid transporter neutral SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As transmembran protein, ACE2 serves as a major entry point into a cell for some coronalvirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (DOV causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID).
More specifically, S1 protein binding on cheating or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with an ACE2 enzyme domain on the surface of the cell leads to endotosis and transmission of viruses and enzymes that lie in the endosom.
This virus's entry process also requires a condition of protein S by a TMPRSS host that his users are currently investigating as potential therapy.
But many professional societies and regulating boards continue to treat ACE and standard ARB standard inhibitor therapy.
A systemic review and metaanalysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of the ACE Inhibitor causes a significant reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared with control."
Further, "ACE's inhibitant use also lowers the risk of pneumia on patients who have higher risk for pneumia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of the ACE engineer is also associated with a death loss associated with pneumia, though its results are less powerful than the risk of the overall pneumony."
ACE2 human recombian (rhACE2) was expected to become new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase lung hemodinamics and unit oxygen in pig children with acute respiratory disease syndrome produced by lipopplisaride.
Time for 10 hours in humans with 30 minutes of work except for 24 hours of effect.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with tolerance of re-inhibitentin-inhitorsin (inhibitor RA) classics or in illness with the disease with the II in the blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been diagnosed in clinical trials for acute respiratory treatment.
b'Aprice COVID 19 is a mobile software application designed to help track contact to cope with the crown rescue of 20,1920, that is, the identifying process of identifying the person “connected” that may have made contact with a infected person.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which receive official support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Some working shells to build contact tracking applications have been developed.
Disgusting privacy issues, especially the system that is based on the tracking of the application user's geographic location.
Alternatives that don't get too into privacy include the use of Bluetooth signal to record the approach of the user with another cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would redesign functions to support the Bluetooth based application directly into the Android and IS operation system.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has spread applications that allow citizens to check if they've been in contact with COVIDS.
This application was used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, the application called TraceTagether.
This application is developed by the local T.A. community, released as an open source, and will be delivered to the government. North Macedonia launched "Stop Korona!", an application based on Bluetooth to track down exposure to the potential infected and offer quick response to health care authorities.
This application is developed by the Institute of Communication and Technology and Health Care.
Until April 14th 2020, the application is still waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store's approval.
On April 12, the government stated that contact tracking applications are in further development stages and will be available to spread within weeks. similar applications are planned in Ireland and in France "StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore TraceTagether applications and BlueTrace protocols. Russia means to introduce geofenic applications for patients diagnosed with COVID 19 who live in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that might have occurred in the application-based system, which includes fake positive and possible lack of effectiveness if the data is taken limited at only a small portion of the population.
To solve concern about the spread of a misleading or dangerous "coronavirus" application, Apple sets limits on the kind of organization that can add a directly related application to the App Storm, that is limit only to the "resmi" organization or who has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon applied similar restrictions.
Supporters of privacy express their concern about the mass survey application using the Grandvirus application, especially of whether the surveyary analysis created to handle the Grandvirus’s hangout will be stopped after the threat passes.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issue a statement that calls for limitations on this sort of survey.
This organization states eight requirements on government projects:
The survey has to be "in accordance with law, necessary, and professional";
The need for surveillance and survey should have the sun’s sunset light;
data use must be restricted for COVID 19th destination;
security and anonymity of data must be protected and proved protected based on evidence;
digital survey must avoid increasing discrimination and Marginalization;
Each data division with third party must be defined in laws;
must be protected against abuse and rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
The meaning partation of all "my relevant interests" is required, which includes community health experts and group are equipped. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and journalists Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) also issued a check list.
The proposed Google/Apple plan means to resolve the ongoing survey problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operation system after no longer necessary.
Some countries use network - based locations tracking, instead of applications, thus eliminating the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network - based tracking was approved.
The network-based solution that has access to raw data has a significant potential for privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use central servers only for intercommunication (see part below).
In South Korea, an unbased system used for contact tracking.
Instead of using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to create notifications through text messages to a potential infected person.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contact, the government also makes the information available to the public, which is allowed with extensive changes in information privacy laws after the distribution of the MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and web sites. Such countries as Germany consider using the system and system that protects privacy.
Until April 6th 2020, the details have not been released.
A review of the privacy - protection contact is an open concept, with a large number of research liters starting from at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts are working a private social solution, such as using Bluetooth Lergy (BLE), to record the approach of users by other phones.
However, the PEP-PPP-PPP is an effort that contains a tele-desturized and disobeying approach, and not single protocols. Integration protocols include the CD-PPPPPP/DP-3T ), the current contact (TCN, previously called the Contact number, CEN), and the Socimcimsionalsionals for Contact (PACT) and Other Calls.
In this protocol, identified personal data has never left the device, and all matching matches occur on the device.
The Privacy group at the MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, platforms to use a technique to protect privacy when collecting and using locations or international data to track the message of COVID 198.
This is based on the research of the "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Incidentac" released on March 2020. Other same ones are a safeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and originally built in MT Media Lab.
SafeTrance uses the safe hardware technology to allow users to share the location and health data sensitive to other users and officers without sacrificing the privacy of the data.
On April 520, the global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that were basically the same approach and are a highly benefited protocol, with a purpose of reducing the fragment and allowing global interaction for tracking applications and warnings, which is a major aspect of reaching a wide reception.
On April 9th 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made BlueTorace protocols used by the government's official application to be an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and IOS platform platforms, announced the initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of Bluetooth Lowgy technology and telepographics that protect privacy.
They also duplicate the core technology specification used in that system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to launch in three stages:
The device launch to allow the government to create an official program of coronavirus tracking that protects privacy
The combination of this function directly to the ISS and Android Google and Apple is planning to resolve the problem of taking data and surveys is constantly contributing the system through operating systems, and then removing it in the same way after the threat passes.
b'Reposition of drugs (also called new goals, new profiles, or new tasks on drugs or therapies) are the use of drugs that have been approved for new purposes of medicine, that is for disease or medical conditions that are different from the original purpose of drug development.
This route is the current scientific research line to develop a safe and effective COVID treatment.
Another way of research includes the development of COVID 19th vaccines and convalent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a target for drugs, each protein has some kind of league-connation sites.
The analysis of those league binding sites can be the basis for effective medical development of the COVIDian protein.
Some of the SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are the most important proteases similar to papains, RNA polymersase hanging-RNA, heikase, protein S, and ADP subfostase.

b'Vaksin COVID 198 is a mortgage vaccine for malvirus 2019 (COVID) disease.
Even though there are no vaccines to complete clinical trials, there is a lot of effort being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, this disease-unsarative virus will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in a test security study of Face I in April.
THE 19th COVID was identified in December 2019.
Big bees spread worldwide in 2020, resulting in investment and great research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations have been published to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI’s stability gave a statement on April that the thing to consider in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, preaching on the scale required, and global access.
In April, the CEPI Academy reported that 10 different tech platforms were in research and development during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVIDS.
The main platform target that's forwarded to Face I'm security study, covered:
nukleat acid (DA and RNA) (Fase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vestor (Fose I and vaccine candidate: Cans Sino Biologycs, denecrus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists on April, the total 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stage of development, with 78 being confirmed as an active project (79, according to the Milken Institute), and the other 37 were announced, but with a little public information available (redesigned or under design).
Test test Face I-II perform the original security and immune tests, usually performed randomly, controlled callosebos, and in some locations, while determining more effective doses.
Fase III tests usually involve more participants, including control groups, and testing vaccine effectiveness to prevent diseases, while monitoring side effects on the doses.
Of 79 active vaccine candidates (exposed early April 2020), 74 of whom have not been in human evaluation (are still in "prinis" research).

By the end of March, the Canadian government announced a fund of C$2 million for 96 medical research projects on COVID 19th, which included a number of vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universitys, such as Medicine and Saskatchewan University.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced a fund as much as C$192 million special to develop the COVIDim vaccine, with a plan to set up a national vaccine of several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus plague occurred.
On April 2th 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University of PettCoVac, candidate of the COVID American vaccine, in the mouse; they claim that "MNA gave sub vaccineunitS-CoV-2 results in a specific antibodi antibodial response that began to be seen two weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, Fakultas Farmaki University Waterloo announced the design of DNA - based vaccine candidates as a potential vessel.

In March 2020, government, industry, and three U.S. universitys gathered resources to access supercomputer from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources of Heckard Enterprise, Amazon, and Google.
Some vaccines have heteroologist effects, which are also called nonspecific effects.
It means that these vaccines can benefit beyond his preventable disease.
Further tracking tests in Australia are trying to run 4.5 health officials.
There's a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early study of vaccine diversity using a specific COVID animal model, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other lab animals, and nonhuman primates, shows the need for protection measures to reach a third biological level in handling the virus, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaks against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
Until 2020, no medicine or protective vaccine for SARS has proved safe and effective on humans.
According to the research published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide, and so does the vaccine that has been proved for MERS.
When MERS became a prevalent, the existing SARS study could be a useful template to develop vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine that completed the IMS-GamVc clinical test on humans, and the other three vaccines are in the process, which are all virus-vecor -vec vaccines, two charvecs of the virus, two charx1-MSSS, BVADS, and one version.
The social media posts have sponsored the conspiracy theory that claims the virus behind COVID 19 has been known before and that vaccines have been available.
The assets quoted by various social media posts refer to the extensions that exist for genetic definity and vaccines for other coronavirus, such as the Grandvirus SARS.
b' Grandvirus 2019 (COVID) is an infectious disease caused by acute acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms cover fever, cough, and breath out.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of compassion, and stomach pain.
Time from exposure to symptoms in general about five days, but it can range from two to fifteen days.
Although most cases resulting from mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and fail the lab organ.
Up to April 1720, over 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and teritorial regions, resulting in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 58,000 people have recovered. This virus especially spreads human beings when it comes to contact, often through sparks or small drots generated by coughs, bears, or when talking.
Despite the release of the breath, the etcout usually falls to the ground or to the surface and is not contagious to long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is highly contagious for the first three days after the act of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms arise and after the next stage of disease. Standard diagnosis is with a real-time polymeration chain reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction (rRT-PCR) in use of nasofaring.
The use of masks is recommended for people who are suspected to be infected with viruses and people who take care of them.
The mention of the use of masks by the general society is different; some of the authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend use of them, and others require use of them.
Right now, there are no specific vaccines or treatment for COVID 198.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in nearly all countries in six WHO regions.
The person infected with virus can be without symptoms or symptoms like flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing.
The emergency symptoms include breathing, pain or constant pain in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, face or lips; medical delay is advised if these symptoms appear.
The symptoms of breathing above, such as water, snots, or throat pain can be found, but more rarely occur.
The symptoms of gastroindol, such as mual, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in a variety of percentages.
A few cases in China were initially singled up with a clinistic image of chest and palpia.
To some people, disease can develop into pneumonia, failure in the essential organs, and death.
It's called an invalid period.
The iVID period for COVID is usually five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of the person who's going through symptoms in 11.5 days of infection, reports indicate that not everyone infected with symptoms.
This lack of symptoms in transmission is not fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
At present, an infected person's reporting that doesn't show the symptoms unknown and being reviewed, with the Korean Disease Control Center and Prevention reports that 20% of all cases are confirmed without symptoms during hospital treatment.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include cases without symptoms in its daily case on April 1; from 166 infection that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at test.
Sputum and lour water can carry virus loads on a large scale.
Speaking loudly release more sparks or blowouts than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that undamaged coughs can cause the blow to be pushed to a quarter of an inch [4.5 m] (15 ft).
Although this virus is usually not transmitted through the air, the U.S. National Science Academy shows that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air gatherings are placed in the hallways outside the room of people's room produce a positive sample for RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as introducation and lung resusciation, can create acres of breathing to become aerosol and then spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the newlyes, this risk is believed to be low.
European Disease Control Center (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easy it is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others. This virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on carton/karus, up to three days in plastics and rusty steel, and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, it's different depending on panic and temperature.
Sabun and detergen are also effective if it is used properly; soap products describe the layer of the virus's protective fat, detecting viruses, and releasing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other areas, such as cloordium cloord and chorhexin gluct, are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, liur water sample was taken in median two days after the inap enabled.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus burden, and the sixth patient showed the highest load of virus in testing the second day.
The Konsavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new weight - respiratory syndrome, which was once isolated from three people with pneumnia, which was based on a case of acute respiratory disease in Whatter.
All features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are in the new crownvirus of nature.
Outside the human body, this virus was killed by household soap, which broke his protective bubble.
Paru is the most favored organ by the COVID 19 because the virus accesss the immune cell through the enzymes that transform 2 (ACE2), the most abundant in the alveolar type II lung cell.
This virus uses special surface glycoprotein called "spepe or tonjolan" to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
The acute heart rate was found at 12% infected people who were treated in Huan, China, and more often in severe illness.
High levels of symptoms are due to systemal inflamation and immune system disorders during the development of illness, but micard acute injuries may also be associated with ACE2 receivers in the heart.
The ACE2 revision is expressing very high in the heart and involved in heart function.
Insited trombosis and high trombombolism of vena (25%) were found in the HOVID infection patient in ICU and may be associated with bad prognosics. The Otosisisi to those who died because COVIDS found the alvelar damage (D) and infiltrated infrations that contain silitis in the lungs.
Even though SARS-COV-2 has tropicale cells for air-scraping ACE2, heavy COVID patients have systemic hyperinflamation symptoms.
In particular, T cells that reconcept GM-CSF pathogenics proved to be compatible with the recruits of monocycs that recurre Ll-6 inflamerology and severe lung pathology in patients COVID.
The limfosic Infiltrate has also been reported on the autopsy.
WHO has applied some testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is the reaction of polymerase transcripatory re-time (rRT-PCR) chain reaction reaction reaction.
This test is usually performed on a respiratory sample obtained by means of nasopharing; however, the application sample of nasal or sputum can also be used.
Mostly, results are available in hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but it takes two blood samples taken in two weeks so that the results have a small amount of time.
Chinese scientist China is able to isolate this coronavirus gallur and duplicate its genetic sequence so that the lab around the world can develop tests of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) independent to detect infection by this virus.
On April 420, an antibodi test (who can detect active infection and if someone has been infected earlier) is in development, but not much was used.
The Chinese experience with the test shows its only 60 to 70%.
The United States of America approved test point-of-care on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The accusedman was released by the University of Zhangs University suggests methods of detecting infection based on the image of clinical and the risk of epidology.
Opacity of ground-glasss multilobars if it's with the peripher distribution, assy notary, and posterior many found at the beginning of infection.
Subleural dinging, crazy patching (reserving a loose - controld sum of alveolars), and consoles can appear as a result of the development of disease.
A little data available on microscopic lessons and pathphyology CVID 198.
Main pathological guests on the autopsy are:
Makroskopi: phemies, perustics, lung consoles, and lung edema
Four types of pneumony virus enlightenment can be observed:
light pneumonia: edema lunger, hyperplae pneumocytes, pneumotium attic acids, interstitial inflution by limphysic implanting, and forming giant cells incient
heavy pneumonia: alveolar damage difus (DD) with alveolar Exuity difus.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory disease (ARDS) and heavy hypoxemia.
pneumonia in healing stage: Exturity in alveolar buffer and non-stitial fbrosis
Blood: intravasing intravascular coagulation (DIC); predisposing reaction
The preventive steps to reduce the possibility of infection include staying in the home, avoiding places of the crowd, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing a good breathing hygie, and avoiding touching the eyes, the nose, or the mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing your mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sink and recommending the use of the inside areas if the tissue is not available.
Hygiene's appropriate hand after coughing or dissipating.
The CDC recommends the use of the face cover in public places, some to limit transmission by without symptoms. The social restrictions are intended to reduce person’s contact with many, by closing schools and places, restricting travel, and canceling major meetings in public.
The restrictions also include keeping people away at least 6 feet or 17 feet [1.8 m].
No known drug prevents COVID 19. Because vaccines are anticipated haven't been there until the beginning of 2021, the main part in handling COVID 19 is trying to reduce the peak of an epidemic, known as "strucing the orbit".
The CDC also recommended that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, and after washing their noses, coughs, or water.
Further CDC recommends using alcohol - based hand mutilation that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In an area where commercial hand-making is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicroba activity comes from ethol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide used to help eliminate bacteria in alcohol; this substance is "not active for hand antiseptics".
Gliserol was added as ahuktan.
People are treated with support care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they're carrying a virus to wear simple facial masks.
Exxigenation of extracorporum membrane (ECMO) has been used to cope with respiratory failure, but the benefits have been considered.
Cleanness and lifestyle and healthy diets are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be helpful to those who have mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.
The U.S. intensive treatment experts and the U.S. surgeon have set up treatment recommendations of various institutions into free resources, which is the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there has been no specific treatment for COVID 198.
For symptoms, some medical energy recommends paraserics (placetaminofen) more than mother profen for the use of the first lini.
The prevention action must be taken to minimize the risk of viral transmission, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosol, such as intubtations or hand vents.
For health support of COVID, the CDC recommends putting the person in the Insolation Infectional Infections (AIR) besides using standard precautions, contact precautions, and anti-air prevention measures. The CDC listed guidelines for the use of protective devices (APD) during the establishment.
The recommended equipment is: APD garment, respirator or face masks, eye masks, and medical gloves. If available, respirator (not face masks) is better.
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial settings, but the yurumí has contaminated this mask to use by emergency usage (EUA) usage (EAU).
N95 respirators were designed to protect from the surface particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for the use that is not mentioned in the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using the facial shield or, as the last effort, the master's made.
Most of the case is not too heavy until it needs mechanical ventilation or alternative ventilation, but some cases are indeed heavy.
The type of breathing support for people who experience COVID 198 breathing failure is active for those who are treated inap, and there is evidence that intubations can be avoided with high stream levels or preposive air salt pressure.
Haven't known whether either of these methods has resulted in the same benefit to people who are critical.
Some doctors prefer to use mechanical vents when available.
Many developed countries have no adequate hospital beds, which limit the health system’s capacity to deal with the sudden total amount of COVIDM cases that are quite severe enough to require inap.
A study in China found that 5% entered the intensive care unit, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people treated in less than ICU eventually entered the ICU.
The mechanical ventilation became more complex with acute memory syndrome occurs at COVID 19th and oxygen became harder.
Ventilators who are able to perform high pressure control modes and PEEP are required to assess oxygen delivery and reduce the risk of lung injury and pnemotracts associated with ventilation.
High PEEP may not be available on the old ventilator.
Research on the potential for treatment began in January 2020 and some analytic drugs are in clinical trials.
Redesivir seems to be the most promising.
While the development of new drugs may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested have been approved for other uses or have been in further examinations.
The drug can be tried on people with severe diseases.
Volunteers recommended by WHO join in testing the effectiveness and security of potential treatment. The list has given temporary authorization to convalent plasma as an experimental treatment in a person’s life cases are extremely or as well as threatened.
Convalent Plasma hasn't conducted a clinical study needed to prove its security and effectiveness for this disease.
In February 2020, Chinese launched mobile applications to deal with the disease plague.
User requested to enter their name and ID number.
This application is able to detect close contact using survey data so that it can detect the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If the potential of risk is detected, the application is not only recommended independent quarantine, but it also tells local health officials. A technicality on cell data, facial recognition technology, cell tracking, and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and people who are connected with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 20,20, the government of Israel allowed the security body to track down the phone data of a person who was suspected to be infected with the crownvirus.
That step was taken to run quarantine and protect people who might be exposed to infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Ultsche Teleom shared telephone data association with the German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
The Russians used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
The Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed of the phone operator that "40% of the people are still moving places.
The German government does the hackathon weekend 48 hours with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, makes a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the crownvirus.
People may experience pressure caused by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The rise of social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic breakdown is a perfect storm that threatens the mental health and well - being of society."
This disease can take on a slight or without symptoms, which resembles the disease of another general breath control, such as a pill.
A mild case usually recovered in two weeks, while those with severe or critical illnesses may need three to six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for COVID extremely heavy infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVIDS is still less.
In the worst of people, COVIDS can quickly develop into acute respiratory syndrome, which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or failure.
Comps associated with CVID 19 is a sepsis, abnormal blood clot, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and hearts.
Blood clot difference, especially the increase in protrombin time, is observed on 6% of the Inapproped COVID patients, while kidney function disorders are seen at 4% of this group.
Some 20-30% of people with the image of COVID 19 shows increased heart enzymes.
According to the same report, median time between symptoms and deaths is ten days, with five days spent in the inapt.
However, patients transferred to ICU have seven days of median between ink and death.
In a study that studied early cases, median time started from early symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) China, men have a 2.8% death rate, while women have a 1.5.
The postmortem lung test check shows damage to alveolar infus with mobile fibromics in both lungs.
The changing sytopatic virus is observed in pneumocytes.
The picture of the lung resembles acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of death reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, the heart damage is observed, with an increase in tropulin or constant heart rate.
According to the March data from the United States, 89% of those receiving ink have the default condition. The supply of medical and economic resources can also affect mortality.
The fatal estimate of conditions varies because of the differences in the region, but it is also due to methodological difficulties.
The loss of light cases can cause the death toll to be counted too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean death rates today are too low.
But smokers have a possible 1.4 times greater symptoms of severe COVIDS and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die than those not smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital institution found a drop in lung capacity 20% to 30% on some people who recovered from disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive path syndrome after healing.
Until March 2020, it was not known if earlier infection gave effective and long - term immune to those who recovered from this disease.
Imunity is seen, if it's seen another coronavirus behavior, but it has been reported that a case was followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days after.
This case is believed to be a bad remaining infection, and it's not recontroduced infection.
This virus is thought to be natural and is from an animal, through a spread infection.
Actually unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human transmission to man.
A study of 41 cases confirmed first COVID 19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reveals the date of early symptoms is December 1, 2019.
The official publication of WHO reported the earliest symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Mostly, some measurements are used to calculate fatality.
These numbers vary according to areas and over time, as well as are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of health care, treatment options, time since the first plague, and the character of such population as age, sex, and health as a whole.
At the end of 2019, WHO sets the ICD-10 emergency U07.1 for death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection that confirmed lab and U07.2 deaths by clinically diagnosed or an epidemic without confirmation of lab infection for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rate of death shows the number of cases of deaths confirmed in a specified interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death ratio on a global case is 6.9% (153.82/240.191) by April 2020.
The number differs according to the region. Other estimates include the fatality of cases (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosiss who died from certain diseases, and the fatality of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (the diagnosis and undiagnosed) that died of certain diseases.
These statistics are not bound on time and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not everyone infected makes antibodis, the existence of antibiotics can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the outbreak of the plague in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village that contains 46,000 citizens, 80 (1,0) is dead.
In Gangelt, this disease is spread through the Carval festival, which spread to the young, causing relatively lower mortality, and probably not all of the deaths of COVID are classified as COVID 198 deaths.
Moreover, the German health system has not yet been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodi, as studying from blood donors.
69 people (0.004 percent of the population) why they died of COVID 198.
It's different for men and women.
Mortality is higher on men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with the risk rate between men and new women doesn't appear at 90.
In China, death numbers for men by 2.8 percent and for women by 1.7 percent.
The reason for the difference based on this sex is unknown, but genetic and behavior may be an excuse.
Immunological differences based on sex, lower exposure to smoking to women, and men with serbid conditions, such as hypertensity, at younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality on men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected people are men and 72% of those who died because COVID 19 are men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government doesn't track the sex - related data for CVID infection.
Research shows that virus diseases, such as Ebolic, HIV, influence forts, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
Percentage of women's male health is higher, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to viruses.
The World Health Organization announced at February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease was "COVID"
WHO Leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreresus explained that CO is short for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first outbreak of the epidemic identified: December 31, 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographic location, an animal species, or a group of people, along with international recommendations to prevent stigmatization. A virus that causes COVID8 to be named after a heavy respiratory rate 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "virus COVID 19th" and "virus responsible for COVID" in public communication.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly called "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the plague in Wlan, China, this virus and disease are commonly called "coronavirus" and "Cronavirus Wwan."
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease as a temporary name for virus and disease according to 2015's guidance to not use the name of the location in the name of disease and virus.
The official name of COVID 19th and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on February 11, 2020.
Because of the limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital producers print such health care materials as drug use and ventilation components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital desperately needs a ventilator valve, and the installation can't provide on a necessary time scale, a local company engineered and printed 100 valves that were needed last night.
After the start of the COVID 19th plague, conspiracy theory, wrong information, and informed of origin, scale, precautions, medicine, and other aspects of disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem able to spread the virus to some other animals.
Sttudi failed to find evidence of viral complications in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and CVID 198 drugs is being done by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARY Trial" to consider the effects of the four - hour medical effect that already exists with the most promising success.
Vaksin is not available yet, but various institutions are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previously on SARS-CoV studies used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-CoV are both using ACE2 receivers to enter the human cell.
There are three vaccination strategies being examined.
First of all, researchers are aiming to make a virus vaccine intact.
The use of the virus, both inactive and dead viruses, is intended to quickly trigger human immune reactions to new COVID infection.
Second strategy, subunit vaccines, aim to create vaccines that create sensitive immune systems against certain subunits on viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on S-spike protein that helps infiltrate the virus’s enzyme extended - ACE2.
The third strategy is a nukleat acid vaccine.
The experimental Vaks made with these strategies had to be tested to find out security and fame, on March 16, 2020, the first clinical test a vaccine started with four volunteers indown.
Vaksin contains an harmless genetic code copied from a virus that causes disease. The increase depends on it has been recommended as a potential challenge for SARS-COV-2 vaccine development, but this method is still controversial.
There's more than 300 active clinical tests going on in April 2020.
Seven trials are trying to evaluate the treatment that has been approved for malaria, including four studies on hydrophocroclins or chlorines.
The new purposed drugs formed most Chinese research, with nine tests of Face III on the brakesivir in some countries with the delay of reporting at the end of April.
In April 2020, dynamic reviews of clinic development for vaccine candidates and COVID 198 drugs are already present. Some of the drugs available for COVID 19th medical treatment, which includes chordesivir, chlorics and hydrocroplorins, lopinvir/rivir, and lopinavir/trnar are combined with the interfers.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for the success of the brakes.
The increase in clinical activity is observed in patients who are treated with brakes in emergency treatment.
The U.S. clinical testing of Face III is being done in the United States, China, and Italy.
However, there is a call for research review on the research.
Korean Health Authority and Chinese recommend the use of chlorakuin.
However, the Virology Institute Wurku, despite recommending daily doses of one gram, notes that doses twice are extremely dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the yurumí issued emergency authorization for hyroxiscococrin and chlorines for doctor's policy that took care of COVID. The 7th Chinese edition of interferon, vevirin, or umifeovir to be used against COVIDS.
Early data shows that high doses are required to hinder SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazanides have been recommended for further vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 reserv in low concentration. The analysis suggests that the initial delay of the ton protein is being promoted by sintease transmembreran 2 (TMPRS2) is essential to enter SAR-CoV-2 through the form of an ACUTUC2 prescription.
Sttudi about chloruokuin and hydroxicocroculin with or without azitromisin has had great limitations which have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamavir doesn't prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and have no known role in COVIS.
Cytokin storm complications can happen on top of an advanced stage COVID.
There is evidence that hycrocin might have an antisictokin quality.
This drug is undergoing a second phase test at the national level of Italy after showing positive results on people with severe diseases.
Combined with the blood test of pheritin serum to identify the sytokin storm, this drug was meant to fight the sytokin storm, which is supposed to be the cause of death on some of the dissidented people.
In 2017, anagonitist of interleukin-6 approved by the problem study of resuspective cases for treatment of siquitic syrracter vaccines that were produced by different causes, which is CAR T cell therapy.
Until now, there has not been any random and controlled evidence that tocizumabs is an effective treatment for CRS.
Sending refined and blessed antibodis produced by the cured system of people from COVID 19th to those who need it are being tested as nonvaksin passive immunization methods.
This strategy is tried for SARS with unconclusive results.
The virus Netralization is the expected working mechanism for passive antibodi therapy can combine defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as mobile sytototototosis that depend on antibodi and/or phagotoosis, might as well.
Other passive antibodi therapy, for example, uses the produced monocal antibootic antibodi, is being produced.
The management of convalents, which are a part of the patient’s cured blood and contains specific antibodis against these viruses, can be improved for faster use.
Kolvius disease, a group of closely associated syndromes
Li Wenha, a doctor at the Atrocing Hospital, who was infected and then died of the COVID 19th because of the resulting awareness of the spread of the virus.
