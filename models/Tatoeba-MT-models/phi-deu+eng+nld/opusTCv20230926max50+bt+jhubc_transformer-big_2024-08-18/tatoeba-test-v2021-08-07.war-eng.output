You're going to be squishy, you've got to get off.
You're young.
You are the one who knows to do this.
You're the only one who thought that this idea was good enough.
Your life will be saved.
What you're writing about.
You should be helping Tom.
You would have helped Tom.
You're going to be proud of me.
Call me right now.
I hope you didn't write it.
You've got the name Maggies.
Let's say you're screwed.
It's important to know that you've got to be squandered.
You still need help.
It's still sniffing.
You didn't write, didn't even call.
You're going to get out of here, aren't you?
You came down.
You came down.
You won.
You won.
You'll never do that.
You'll never do that.
You will never do it.
You're never 'to do'.
