AMs from Wales are afraid to "be seen as fools"
There is consternation among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was raised due to plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament's assembly.
The AMs across the political spectrum are worried that this will make them look ridiculous .
AM Labour said that his group was concerned that "it has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the language of Wales twp means ibleh and pwp means feces.
Plaid's AM said the entire group 'was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
A conservative from Wales said his group had an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that there was a slight verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this context the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced in a manner similar to the pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of what should be called the Assembly Members will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government's 2017 act empowered the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the widely supported proposals to call the assembly a Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the title of AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but MWP received most support in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus could be a headache for the chairman's officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft of the changes legislation within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how they should be called when they have a debate on the legislation.
Macedonia to leave public opinion in a referendum on the country's name change
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up with the aim of resolving a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor stands for .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the consequence of entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing as churches in Harlem are sending
"Historically, the elders I spoke with say there was a bar and a church in every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today, there is nothing."
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People are socializing differently nowadays."
"The bars are no longer the activity center of the locality where people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders think, "and sooner or later they will end up back where they were at the beginning."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks with condominiums filled with the kind of people that will not help the rest of the local sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings will be white carnage," he said, "and thus, they will not be bored when the day comes that they are created for these churches because very likely of these people who come to live in these condoms will not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of white carnage people before Harlem became a metropolis of white carnage people - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of people of white carnation left in the 1930s.
A congregation of black carnage people practicing the nearby religion took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken from a congregation of black carnage people under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers at 125 Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who resisted leasing to or promoting black carnage people.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and the successor of St. Martin's, was proud when he called the carillon "the bells of the people."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: a "cultural treasure" and a "unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carillon in the world to have a black carnage musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who walked for the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's had not changed with anyone else.
What has happened in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some introduced by lay church leaders, others from the Episcopal diocese.
The 'vestry' - the parish's governing body, composed of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "will seek to pass costs" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in engaging the architects and contractors it sent from the diocese.
Some of the protesters complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy is injured in a lobster trap in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. where Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then went to him with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of catching a lobster, but then "realized that he was shouting, 'Give me up!
"Give me up!"
"It's all over the place," Hammel said, realizing the moment he came to where the boy was.
"I shouted for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
They took the boy by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack was not known.
The Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said in a meeting with the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with corridors of similar shelves to those of a department store of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial revenue in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of clothing and household goods decline, the larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and the idea will spread to more stores if successful this year.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use the shelf space that was once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double the amount of beauty items it's offering up to 3000 items, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by smaller buyers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will examine concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, lower London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to shopping with small amounts of food every day in local convenience stores means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to shop there.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the stores will increasingly look like 'department stores' as the supermarket chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl discounting stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since he bought the two chains two years ago, which he says has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the bond ended after a fight over how to split revenue from pharmacy stores into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit every need and the attractive environment and convenient store positions mean we have become a destination of beauty products of interest that challenge the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'extremely rattled' after Holly Willoughby canceled a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
The character of Dragons Den Peter Jones 'extremely angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby canceled an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle firm's business to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for the brand of home products and their accessories, Truly.
The pair's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's firm, Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left a character of Dragons' Den Peter Jones very angry because she canceled being part of their business of a very money-making lifestyle firm at the last minute - to focus on her big contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enrome business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant T'orly's products were out of time.
The business was compared to the firm of Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce she was leaving with Truly, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private holidaymakers.
A source said: "Truely was by far Holly's first priority.
It would be her long-term future that would fill her the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely astonished.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost over.
There is a full product store at Marlow's headquarters that are ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's profit-making personalities, could mean a cost of millions to the company due to a large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for further delays to its launch.
It can be the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three children, Willoughby and her compatriot Dan Baldwin have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, came with them as chairman chairman in March.
Couples travel together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M<0x26>S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity presenter of ITV.
Last night, a source close to Jones said "We don't comment on his economic affairs."
It's a difficult time, but then we found love."
He joked about criticism he would earn from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why do you think President Trump was so upset?
Trump said in a voice that mimics that of a "news presenter".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump boasted that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, note, the United States is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech of manifestation.
He said, "We're going well with North Korea".
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
We now have a very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - the end of rocket tests, aid in the release of hostages and the return of American veterans who had been left behind at home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing at the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroys Island, Kills Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they were not necessary.
Even after more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to move from their homes, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is challenging," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign staff can operate on site.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesperson of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to forcing aid.
Considering the earthquakes that occur frequently in Indonesia, the country is still not well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While a shelter from the tsunami was built in Aceh, you hardly see them on the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite issuing a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of times, traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was stationed in Lombok to care for the victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to Indonesia's falling infrastructure, the center of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration dispatched due to lack of funds as he faces his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions that remain in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the road, using ‘machetes', bows and arrows and other types of weapons.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores evenly in the last minute vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a 'goal' in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was 27 metres away from Chelsea's pole with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball slightly to his left before shooting the ball into the pole.
The ball flew much above the box as it finished it entered the upper right side of the net.
Eventually, the ball dropped behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped to try to receive it, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get into that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always push it forward as much as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come over me and I touched the ball once and I didn't think much about it and I tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 to the half of the game after bringing in a goal in the 25th minute from very good Belgian player Eden Hazard.
The Chelsea striker handed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before leaving running towards the middle of the pitch and then quickly entering the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic passes the ball swiftly into midfield.
Then he shot the ball very nicely, leading Hazard inside the box.
Hazard ran over the players in the defence and sent the ball into the net with his left foot and passed through Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fight Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people have been reported trapped under the debris of the building that collapsed due to the 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet, said a spokesperson from the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was filled with debris from the collapsed buildings.

Cromwell Parliament statue becomes last monument hit by 'rewrite history' argument
Its removal would be a form of justice appropriate to the destruction similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the British religious and cultural artifacts carried out by its fanatical ‘Puritan' followers.
But Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The ‘conoclasm' of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as ‘Lord Protector' also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Swine Killer Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a cut artillery, covered in blood near a pen in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported.
A pig farmer prepares to inject the vaccines into pigs in 'hoggery' on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
Allegedly, he traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to the pigsty in the vicinity open.
He said there was a swine with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"Cousins' legs were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him by his surname "Wu," as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to avoid attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, cases of swine attacking people have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured.
A decade earlier, a 295 kg pig kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until the animal ejected his wife.
After pigs of a farmer from Oregon attacked and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "cause."
"They're playing.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa debris will cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves on the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and the southeastern United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought in an 85 mph, Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest direction of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a rough formation is forming on the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward to the U.S. West Coast.As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will start pushing strong tropical humidity into the United States in a northeasterly direction
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain into parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity interacting with the approaching trough creates heavy rains spreading across the Southeast in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, debris flows and a possible landslide in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially on a large part of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered character of tropical rainfall.
It would not be a good idea to go out into the desert walking under the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring local winds and dust.
The 'trough' will bring some rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can cause small debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the region's first rainfall of their rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainstorms begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall spreads through Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
There may be some severe temperature changes across the United States in October as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a big example of dramatic temperature differences from the US Center on Sunday.
There is an almost 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures in the 1980s spread from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could climb up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be roughly 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast is indicating high possibilities for above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting testimony on Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing an alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political fight continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with the shocking last-minute news of Friday: a deal drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh babasha when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove her clothes when they were a post-secondary school level party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he is 100 percent sure this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
the company was counting the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers from offices.
To put this in perspective, it's an audience size similar to that for the football decisive game or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was just behind him with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, protesters were captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and were shouting at him as he tried to climb up the elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a live broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to a country?"
They said to him, "You have authority when many women have nothing."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before the doors of the lift were closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting live, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate in full for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee in the following week, which Democratic minorities have long encouraged.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, because it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "taking advantage of politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "taking advantage" of the policy and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May came to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview after one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely mad."
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports the CBS affiliate, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bond was set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office has released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death is a head-to-neck gun injury.
The department is giving credit to the Louisiana State Police smuggling task force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the area's citizens to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement for "diligence and the quest for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter tall striker, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 ‘rebounds’ per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "lost" and "under shock" after Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano throws ash on Mexico City
Ashes being dumped by the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring various tectonic sounds and movements.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geographic physicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The famous beige volcano "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists from Catalonia ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation vote on secession.
A group in favour of the masked separatists who were held back by riot police threw eggs and dust paint at them, creating a cloud of dark dust on the streets usually filled with tourists.
There were also minor clashes during the day and the police had to use clumps to control the clashes.
Over a period of several hours, pro-independence groups were shouting "Don't forget, don't apologize" against unionist protesters shouting, "Spain Forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries they received in the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions have remained high in the region that wants independence a year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatists from Catalonia.
Voters chose by a large gap to become independent, although participation was low with anti-secessionists making a major anti-vote boycott.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hope in the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my mother and father crying with joy that they could vote but now we're alone," he said.
Despite having had a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, pro-independence parties are pushing to keep the momentum this year with many of their best known leaders in either self-determined or imprisoned exile awaiting trial due to their role in organizing the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was caused by politicians from both sides.
"There is more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of Catalonia's nine pre-trial leaders since the end of last year, announced he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"By coming out as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry home more than once.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Investigative inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
A ‘crossbow' could also have been used to shoot at the car at some point.
Menga's goal wins 1-0 game for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first 'goal' for Livingston won the game
Livingston, who was promoted, defeated Rangers and Steven Gerrard lost for only a second time in 18 games as coach of Ibrox's 'club'.
Dolly Menga's ball shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's side was tied in points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has not won once off the pitch in the Premiership this season and next Sunday will play against Hearts, who are in first place and behind them by eight points.
Prior to that match, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna at their stadium in the Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continue to have no loss in the division in six games, with head coach Holt who has not lost a game since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Lost Opportunities Against Massive Visitors
Holt's team should have been winning long ago before he had a goal, with his direct playing style causing a lot of problems for Rangers..
Scott Robinson managed to pass but passed the ball in front of the pole, then Alan Lithgow could only pass the ball with a wide bod after sliding to close to receiving the ball from the head blow from Craig Halkett near the pole.
Those who were playing in their own stadium were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that it was the visitors who could give them problems at certain moments.
And that was the way in which the crucial ‘goal’ arrived.
Rangers let a 'free-kick' in and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and inserted it into the pole from the center of the box.
By that moment, Rangers were dominating possession of the ball, but were finding the team's defense playing on their own pitch, not penetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That style of playing continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman was unable to find a "goal" due to Rangers Allan McGregor's "goalkeeper" and Lithgow shooting the ball wide after passing another Livingston player.
Balls were constantly in the Livingston box and always removed from their players, while two requests for 'penalty' - after Halkett's attempt on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one after the ball was touched by a player's hand - were rejected.
Phoenicians' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
The style of play and their staff have not changed much from the return to the main fight, but the most credit must go to Holt for the way he has joined the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett's head was very large in his games, organising an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on guard.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerrard, there was a lack of well-defined standards this time around.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - only once they managed to break up the defense of the team that was playing on its own pitch - and it is a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the rankings.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) people laughed and sky blue as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then left for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also spoke out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to certain German Turks and believed to be an ‘autocrat' from others.
Road collision in Deptford: Cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a bustling street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics attended, but the man died on the spot.
This crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a car and continued on his way to Childers Street, about a mile away from last Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disorder
Six prison officials were injured after a disturbance in a high security men's prison, the Prison Office said.
Disorder started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were introduced to address the disorder, which involves eight prisoners and is located in one of the sections.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to address an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we will be clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of those who have committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-riot officers were called to prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city with Rapid Floods (Dry Zones May Benefit)
Tropical depression rarely affects Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa flows through the southwest of the desert, leading to risks of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already set up a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for from Western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression status at a distance of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with amounts isolated up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to have from an inch to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals of up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, the Rosa rainfall could be a positive thing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the southwest side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to touching Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which will still be a very strong hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific and thus losing power.
As a result, it is expected to touch Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be severe, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of no more than 10 inches," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, and will then move from Arizona and south of Utah until late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its debris is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora, and in the southwestern desert of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening rapid flooding and debris streams in deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old teenager was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured at Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
17-year-old teenagers, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, said Somerset Police.
Officials appealed to anyone who could have a video pulled from the mobile phone of what happened to speak.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘sent the greens and anger’ of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and shocking tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "sent the greens and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliance and quality and courage."
"A vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with an impeccable public service record", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't dispute it, but in truth, I dispute it," he said.
"So I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates."
Trump has argued that Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first major procedural vote within the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the number of deaths appearing to be increasing
At least 384 people have been killed, many carried as huge waves hit beaches after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six metres (18 ft) high fell to the ground as darkness began, while many were carried and died and everything in the middle was destroyed.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not get up to run immediately and ended up being victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not emerge on its own, it pulled cars, logs, houses, hit everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs emanating from the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges surround themselves and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
There was still a lot of traffic going on in the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the geography of the city, located at the edge of a long and narrow beach, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "were totally sent and without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building could be heard shouting alarm warnings for the tsunami approaching people on the road below.
Within a few minutes a huge amount of water came down on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power cuts that slowed communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll is well over 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived safe and sound in the city of Palu, where employees were sheltering armed tarp shelters in their office yard, they passed by scenes of devastation on their way there, Mr Doseba said.
He said, "I was told that they saw many houses that were destroyed".
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant process of disaster relief, a few complained about the fact that deep-skilled foreign aid workers were not being allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start entering if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet occurred.
"It has been a provincial-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can bring in international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that embellish this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national Paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, who finished early this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight," he said.
Mr Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news that the Hotel Roa Roa had fallen circulated among the paragliding community, he sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival.
His messages, however, only marked that they left, but did not mark that they arrived.
"I think that means the messages didn't arrive," he said.
Haleen take $26,750 while ATM was being replenished at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the amusement complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While busy with his work, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a money bag intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rap singer changes his name to Ye
Rap singer Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change to Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change is made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the programme's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I am, you are, I am, we are.
From Kanye meaning ‘the only one', to Ye only - simply a reflection of what we have good, bad, what confuses us, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rap singers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he would prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
As one who collaborated with West, JAY-Z, also serves with or without a hint and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "he will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double the funds for the I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount they spend on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA notices, even if there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in IA innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major IA acquisition will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the player with the highest rating of American Othello, after which he was executive with Microsoft Research and chairman of Google's branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government competitions in technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when it would be the next one, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get grants from the government.
Lee said, "It is not China that is removing the academic leaders; the corporations are doing it,".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired inspirational people from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to bolster their efforts in the IA.
He said, "I believe the green card should be offered automatically to people who have a PhD in IA".
The State Council of China released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations issue money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that attempted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no action in several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "North Macedonian Republic," a move that resolves a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked its bids for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbour in its north represents a possibility of possession of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote reads: "You are in favor of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of name of the country giving him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was equipping a small stage and preparing seats in front of tents armed by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we have to enter proudly under our own conditions, not by commanding others," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a result in favour of the name change would be a "confirmation of our future."
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum - an amount below that of the required participation.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telema TV, found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious blow to the government's policy in favour of Western ideologies since it took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes all Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his ‘goal' in the 65th minute seem very easy.
The striker from Argentina received a ball from midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran from between three Brighton defenders before running into an open open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green shirts.
He fought with one defender before escaping from many more by the edge of Brighton's box.
He then passes the ball to his left and finds Sterling.
The English striker first touched the ball in the box to re-distribute it to Aguero, who used his right foot to insert the ball into the right side of the net by passing it through Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is sending with some problems in his legs," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about the fact that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's how it happened.
We had the good fortune he did 'goal' at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
That ‘goal’ took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball well into Brighton territory in that action.
He sent the ball right to Leroy Sane with the left hand in a very nice way.
Sane touched the ball shortly before leading Sterling to where the pole is.
The Sky Blues striker slightly touched the ball and inserted it into the net just before it slipped into a territory it is not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in a spoiler vs. Rockies
Since Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But the so competitive player Scherzer hopes to be the pitcher on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which is ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies managed to gain a possibility to continue competing with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday evening, but are still looking to get the division's first title.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can have the chance to win knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What would you want to compete with in those circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer be the pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting for the 34th time, had a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is usually at rest.
The player from Washington who plays with his right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ‘strikeout' in 220 2/3 ‘innings' this season.
President Trump's protests in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation pertaining to the selection for his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"In November, everything we've done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very big -- I don't dispute it, but in truth, I dispute it so I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates," he said.
"We're seeing this very horrific and radical group of Democrats, we're seeing it happening now," Trump said.
And they are determined to take back power by using every possible means, you can see the green.
They don't care who they hurt, who they want to fly to gain power and control, what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
He said Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And I've seen this over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and green and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to the Democratic Senator ranked in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, and received many negative outcry from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?"
"Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what it is.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting, first of all- her body movements weren't positive at all - the worst movements I've ever seen."
The group is no longer a large group.
It does not allow people to express their opinions
When the locals in my neighborhood voted to censure me, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am the most recent MP on the Labour Party's list of MPs who were not welcomed - because we communicated our opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment for fighting anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Council of Friday evening were exactly that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more compassionate and gentle" policy has long been forgotten whether, in fact, it ever began in truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect me to change my mind and take positions that I had never agreed with in other situations - either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in truth, it doesn't matter what I say - they follow me with an abuse on social media with a request to remove me from my MP post, denounce the politics of the center, and tell me that I don't have a part in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Yes, I know I have had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a lot of sexual abuse or racism every day but never hide from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with every motion of "distrust" or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that has encouraged me to keep my opinions for myself, not to be so vocal and then "be all right."
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the negligence of Thatcher's government that left my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, I have sought to improve public services for those who need them most - either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never been a fan of politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I say is that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to work for you and promise you that no amount of threats to remove me from office or of political expediency will discourage me from believing all your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who have not yet lost once, climb to the top in the rankings
Two attempts could slightly alter the result, but there was no doubt that Ayr had deserved to win this exciting Tennant's Premiership game of the day.
They are currently the first in the rankings, the only team out of all ten that have not lost once.
Ultimately, it was the superior defense, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, that helped the team, which was playing on its own pitch, win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've had trials during our matches so far, and we haven't missed one yet, so I'm happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "Giving credit to Ayr, they took advantage of the better opportunities than we do."
With Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from Scotland's head Rory Hughes, who was allowed to play the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an opportunity to try and Jason Baggott converted did not make an activity.
Climo extended Ayr's win by a 'penalty', before, in the middle of the match, he made a 'goal' and converted an individual attempt to bring the points to 17-5 for Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap by 5 points.
The game was then stopped due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the stadium on a streaker, and upon resuming the game, Ayr continued to score points after an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted from Climo.
Then, Ayr Blair Macpherson's chief agent was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose came out aggressively when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team playing on their own pitch started attacking again, and when given a yellow card to Struan Hutchinson for the action he performed on Climo without the ball, from the ‘penalty’ line, MacPherson touched the ball to the ground at the back of the advancing group of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the area from which the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe collected the ball that met David Armstrong from the box and sent Gregor Henry, who plays side by side, for the fifth attempt of the side she was playing on her own pitch.
Still Game's personality seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's personality Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man who plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and takes part in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last one of the program, and it appears that Kiernan is planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to the lists of official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was seeking to engage in Glasgow's "very good restaurant trade."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
The sailors stand guard of the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
A public building has a blue-coloured ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: "The sea is ours right.
"Recovering it is a duty."
Across Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains clear - just as the desire for Bolivians to be able to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia expects a ruling from the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and obviously is awaiting the result with a positive outlook," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's claim, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has a lot to lose in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to having access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia - and that it would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ's ruling arrives only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from fanning Bolivia's cause, the last four years may not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales's hostile rhetoric weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political aid.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to deliver on the promises they made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rivals.
He passes his comments as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy which has stalled more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "hopeless in the void" that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether it should agree to the statement without Pyongyang making the first significant steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of massive headwear that will soon be featured in major stores.
If you want to add to your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you can stop searching.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a range of strange and very large headwear for their Spring and Summer 2019 collection on the runway that enriched the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Not many practical hats are appearing a lot on Instagram this summer and these designers flew their surprising creations on stage.
The object that stood out most from Valentino was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a wide edge resembling the feathers that completely covered the heads of the patterns.
Other very large size accessories included jewel-coated watermelon, a magician's hat and even pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the coloured masks had the lips sewn and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than ‘haute couture'.
One creation resembled the complete diving apparatus with snorkels and goggles, while the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with this good-looking style.
Fashionistas predict that huge ‘bonnets’ will soon appear in the main shops.
The very large hats emerge after the exit of 'La Bomba', the two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The ‘cult label’ responsible for the hat that appeared on social media aired another great creation on stage – a straw basket containing almost as much as the model wearing a mesh she was carrying.
The dark orange raft basket, surrounded by the small raft yarn and with a white leather grip, was the most prominent creation in the 2019 Spring and Summer collection of Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and sea bags in the main shops for next summer - since the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, continuing in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, for their chosen career and for their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages remain a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If he speaks in his own language, he understands with his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that languages are at the forefront of ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher A grade.
Data, collected from the 74 schools that are members of SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A-grade Higher in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject choice, being maintained in the same respect as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that from reasons given to employers for sending to fill job vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you learn another language, this will have a real advantage in the future as it will have such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and, with 15 percent, French is the only language spoken with a percentage of two numbers.
That is why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to be successful, no matter what the future.
It cannot be denied at present, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and therefore this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
The fate of the fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday, LeBron will play for the first time with the Lakers in San Diego.
LeBron James's sports fans have not had much to wait for him to start for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game before the season starts on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes that will be played still has to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
Following the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-match schedule before the Lakers season begins.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
President Trump's Manifestation in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a wave of campaign demonstrations in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first demonstration out of five scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing Congressional control when votes are cast in Nov.
What is Trump's reaction to the protests in West Virginia and how do you see it online?
Trump's demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's manifestation in West Virginia online below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become intense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote suspended for up to a week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary purpose of this wave of demonstrations is to help Republicans face the November elections to gain some momentum.
President Trump's campaign said these five demonstrations next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majority," according to Reuters.
"Congress Control is so important to this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we get closer to the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's demonstration could gather supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team determined not to give up as they approach Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum swing pendulum is a completely invented sport concept but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So where do you say the momentum is now?
"They were six points ahead and now they're four, so I think we're carrying this as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead with twelve more to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel but they have a little setback and they have a lot to encourage them, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasted of three points out of four.
Spieth was accurate from tee to green and is leading by example.
That outcry from the heart of celebration continued to grow as his round continued, making a crucial putt to get a fourth match even when he and Thomas were down two by two.
His putt who won the game on 15 was met by a similar shout, the kind that tells you that he believes the American team is still there.
"You've got to go deeper and worry about your own game," he said.
That's what's left of each of these players now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but sweet couple of Europe are four by four and are considered perfect.
"Moliwood" were the only pair that did not score bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth after Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this live crowd sets out to be the players offering a challenge on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at once on different holes.
But here we are talking about a European glory that is still premature for it.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly finished by Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when she was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get close to getting out of.
But there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to watch closely due to peer interactions, advice they give, advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in a second.
Europe has played better as a team so it has come here and is at the forefront on the final day but this foursomes session also showed that the US Team has the determination that some, especially from the US side, have been questioning.
Europe lead by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourball and foursomes matches in the lead with 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two wins over Tiger Woods who found it difficult to take their score so far ahead in the Le Golf National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, ready to hold the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in the morning fourballs, which took the series by 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but could not come to the difference in score.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points out of Sunday's 12-player matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points out of their four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Having dominated on Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs then worked excellently to defeat Woods who did not seem optimistic and new American player for the season Bryson Dechambeau with an even more empathetic score of 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both matches on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2<0x26>1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
But it didn't all come as Europe wished on a beautiful day, with a little breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a big three-time winner, and Justin Thomas set the limit for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They achieved a bold 2<0x26>1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned later to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4<0x26>3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team returned from a four-point difference while entering the singles, although Furyk's side holders need a draw to hold the trophy.
However, having been second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack seems to be going to be more than they can do.
North Korea says it will "in no way" disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening its lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "considerable goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferation nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared to significantly not to have rejected unilateral denuclearization without thought as it had done in Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal coercively, and even objects to the 'declaration of end of war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a blockade."
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. President Cassidy" Trump called Kim a "suicide rocket man" on a mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to dismantle it, but said much work remained to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for that, saying "If it takes two, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize the fully and final verified denuclearization."
The Security Council unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of halting funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, after within a few hours North Korea criticized him for making "gangster-like demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has managed to make all of its undergraduate students sleep more with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture of studying all night and staying awake thanks to caffeine.
Academics have found that university students in the first place in the world often do not have an idea of the real basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, believing it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
"A girl finally came up to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?'"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious sleep deficit during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a student's bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell them the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance has an effect from sleep deficiency, and the importance of routine sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term insomnia can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - as much as you have a right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of being proud that "you managed to stay up all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient sleep, and good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, severe fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, since lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger, making them all-time hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist for a course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to do a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting up an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as for when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which may unbalance your circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of sadness when they played abroad as Dolly Menga's strike delivered the separated side of Steven Gerrard to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were looking to make a record of their first win while travelling from the February 4-1 triumphal victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side Preartmi.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and Rangers' inspiring list of players never seemed to catch up.
While Rangers now go down to sixth place, Livingston go up for third and only after Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown by the team's supporters who played abroad.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed from Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-trained form has hindered their opponents continuously.
Rangers could have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to score just two minutes from the start when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder took his big shot.
Keaghan Jacobs's strong free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot from behind.
Rangers gained control but it seemed there was more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he should have a penalty on the 15-minute mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson ignored the appeals of the Comorian.
Rangers managed to shoot well only two shots in the first half of the match but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely worried him by Lassana Coulibaly's head blow and Ovie Ejaria's light strike.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute could have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, Rangers failed to manage Jacobs's good set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher shot Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga to end the action.
Gerrard reacted in the brake by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winger shot at Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston went on to attract visitors to play just the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett catching a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could extend their position at the front in the final stages but McGregor held firmly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow went open from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: The Inventor of Geiger's Contactor
And now a page from our Almanac of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, as it is today 136 years old today, and we must count ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Connector.
A foundation of science since then, Geiger's Contact has become a foundation of pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," featuring those unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What's that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger contact, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these cufflinks, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms giving off radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "You say, 'It's certainly popular now!'
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he turned 63.
But the invention by his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behavior as part of treatment.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from a patient, which are transformed into a laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and then be injected again.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behavior, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from a patient, they are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of various types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and how to "teach" them how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.

It's not a good marathon
Kanye West was staged in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a beret of Make America Great, he began to speak out against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white person and you say, 'How can you please Trump, that racist?'"
If I had been concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
SNL began the program with a comedy sketch in which Matt Damon appeared in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West when he posted it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that they had caught up with him behind the scenes about his privilege.
"I'm behind the scenes.
He said, "Don't go out there with that beatitude."
I'm being bullied!
Then they say it's lost," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the lost?" and went on to say that he would "wear my superman's cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
His comments triggered buzzing at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "In the whole studio a great silence has fallen."
West brought him as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West has confounded many with the performance of the song I Love It, worn as a Perrier's Bottle.
West had support from the chairman of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANKS FOR CONTINUING TO THE FOIL."
But presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is and this is an incredibly beautiful thing."
"But I did not choose to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their 'art') who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It is free.
So much more," she added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "what was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the legend of the music we no longer have Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder at knife-blowing restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after a man was stabbed with a knife at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington talks about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke of the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that such screen roles mean that boys often feel they need to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also admitted he has "strong interests" in addressing the issue.
"Personally, I feel I have a strong interest, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity through its very male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young men feel that they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
It's very clear that something went wrong for the boys."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not make prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that "so wars and horses".
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's new production of True West which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that when he met his wife Rose it was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, so this is how my future family gave me, and my life from here on out," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series she won in Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by gender, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spreading rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member disclosed GOP senators' data, says "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats ascertained that claims were being spread by pundits and "ultra-right" websites.
"Lies, lies and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate board hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure was made some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters's office and released the information of a staff member of Waters, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is one of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't be angry.
should not be resistant.
There is no doubt about the defendant's motives.
It should be calm and calm."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is coming out to take Waters's seat in the midterm elections, also made his voice heard on Twitter.
"This is a great thing if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned the "appropriate law enforcement authorities and bodies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the authors will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and all members of my staff."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, a powerless spy imitation
It has become traditional now to look for Brexit meanings in any new film with a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of Johnny English's action-comedy imitation franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and came to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is the ironic self-satisfaction on the subject of how obviously bad we are, the opportunity of a new export of the country?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with his big eyes and unusually moving faces had a second renewed license to do everything wrong - that more than anything else shows that his name is a widespread comic creation designed for territories of non-English-speaking cinema goers.
Of course it is the stupid secret agent who despite his strange claims to his sweet charm has little of Clouseau, a hit of Mr Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the theme melody of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
It is also originally based on the traveler and international man of mystery that once Atkinson had made his part in Barclaycard TV ads, today forgotten, having left chaos behind.
There's a good moment or two in this last issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armored suit and the blades of the propellers caught up with his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift for the physical comedy seems, but the humor feels rather poor and strangely extravagant, especially since the film's "serious" brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer the comedy as an ingredient confidently.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's strange unfortunate incidents weren't as inventive and focused as the jokes of Atkinson's wordless film in Bean's character.
The perennial topical proposition now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's top-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent he was at work - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cherry on the cake for the prime minister who is an imperial and troubled figure, already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Teresa May-like character but there is not much in the script to work out.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that any active spying has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrated operator: a few good jokes here as English offers a School of Rock-type spying academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his very impatient former partner, Bough, interpreted once again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, with a submarine commander, a starring role played by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is slightly wasted.
Thus the two inseparable who always confuse everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty, are back in action, when they encounter the character of a seductive and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the control of the cute technology billionaire who claims that he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their journey of amusing farsa behavior: dressed as waiters, setting fire to a high French restaurant, creating chaos to board Volta's luxury yacht; and English begins a complete anarchy as he tries to use Virtual Reality's helmets to familiarize himself with the interior.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but as friendly and animated as he is, he has little idea of children's television.
Something quite mild.
And like the other Johnny English films I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that he really deserves for his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for Britons to work a week of four days but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see Britons work a week of four days - but be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's educators to pass on the residue of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them another day's free time.
This would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still taking the same pay with them.
Sources said the idea would be "appropriate" to the party's economic agenda and plans that the country leans in favour of workers.
The four-day week shift has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This is not going to happen from today to tomorrow but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration is currently not being approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "those who profit" in utility firms.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back their entire stake as a Labour government can make a "reduction" based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 percent of private sector firms' equity to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence any Republican senator from withdrawing his support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yeah, and sure," said Kennedy.
"I said and entered the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and after that allegation came out, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, inequitable."
However, Graham's vote, seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it has to be a very big accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejected it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And every person who mentions it can't verify it.
It is 36 years old.
I didn't see anything change."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a very impressive list of stars to appear and an equally impressive mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people march to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true goal of the 20th extreme poverty event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of representatives hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay a VIP ticket), those going to the concert had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or some other significant ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the Global Citizen with the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to ask for a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" - do people feel they are making a real difference by signing up for an online petition or posting a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which it has pushed for a number of different goals.
It says these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the secure funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the globe.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of denutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists to appear at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. uses Navy for "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that enlists itself as the "energy consumer voice" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is, more or less, the leverage and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "someone with one ability" with an economy that relies on carbureted fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, by replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to get out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "slave."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gasoline, which is expected to double existing gasoline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has invited the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "examine well" whether she will stand for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "examine carefully" whether to stand for president after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider getting out.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will carefully examine whether I stand for president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was directed in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released Thursday, showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "likely" voters said the senator should not stand for election, according to polls of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Policy Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported the issue for the election.
The polls showed more support for running for election than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential running for election and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed regarding a potential 2020 election exit include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said to officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's demonstration
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recorded in September
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he has returned, I can relate to other families who feel the ramifications of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they return a little differently, return healthier, return to think whether there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and every other member of the military, have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with an attack of domestic violence on a woman, while interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district on Friday filed a case of a court friend in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace's case against Sessions which the American Civil Liberties Union brought in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and sons members of his violent gang," abused her but U.S. officials rejected her asylum claim on July 20.
It was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations face pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine, said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the request, and such a plea violates this principle, said the case of a court friend.
Lawyers went on to argue in the event that the policy of denying immigrants entry damages the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Distressed rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in a fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become increasingly dire.
"It feels very intense," said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while hugging her son, a feverish baby, at an evacuation centre in the unfortunate city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching their stuff flooded with water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his back and shoulder, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to ongoing health shocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he recounted that he felt the violent earthquake move the floor of the hotel on the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have a chance to save ourselves.
I was crushed with the debris of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was at the place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper issued a four-page advertisement in a daily U.S. newspaper trying to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state's most-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that has seen them pass rounds of tariffs on imports of each.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion page in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling this bullying by making propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China is using America's cherished tradition of free expression and free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, on the newspaper stand down the road here in Beijing, you will find limited dissemination voices and you will not see a true reflection of the different views the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media is under Chinese Communist Party restraint," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Are Distracting Women Voters Before Midterm Elections with Kavanaugh's Debate, Warns Analysts
As many top Republicans are backing and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while facing several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions about this have been very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to run with a vote.
These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate hall as Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be of a very high level," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying it was already high; and it's true.
"But they can be higher, particularly between female voters switching votes in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who while they dislike the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested she could pursue an adverse reaction if Republicans run with confirmation.
"This has become a complete shake-up for the GOP," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether to put Kavanaugh on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans handled this situation and how they dealt with it," pointed out news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somehow divided over who they believe in light of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitively or probably believed Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they definitively or probably believed Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations put forward by Ford as well as at least another indictee, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh while he was drunk attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "domination of the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data shop" or POD.
This may include contact lists, lists of what to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the online personal data store unique is that it is entirely up to the user to access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal autonomy through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company brings in the right resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought in by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications through the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking with "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned over from today to tomorrow.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the newly built site on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic for this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: celebrated cleric of the Victoria Cross of World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lt Colonel The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he won the highest British military honor.
Saturday a commemorative stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was to be uncovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award winning.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lt Kurd led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in much fog and fire from rifles on the spot and machine guns."
He later rushed to the line of fire and with "the greatest courage" led the line forward before going for a rifle on the spot alone and losing consciousness three of the troops.
The Lt Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a guirlande behind the parade, which was led by the Imperial Youth Band of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honoured to have played a role in this parade" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was being demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA supporters stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of ending up with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been awake all night to see a Bellator 206 packed to end up denied seeing the main event.
The list by San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One party on Twitter described the change to children's cardboard as "some kind of bulky joke."
"It's a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Pop the pig," yes.
Belator chairman Scott Coker said they would work on scheduling them to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repeating, we can probably fix something," Coker said.
"But right now it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to arrange until our Sunday, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
When it came to writing, there were a lot of messages and not all of them were good.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a governmental issue.
I can assure you that the next one won't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to deliver more for supporters and instead we have gone too far.
It is a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'inferior' because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking about Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
While appearing as a set aside on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" others as he grew up because "it was socially unacceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "Today, those emotions that you feel less than, and feel different, were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, not to disappoint everyone when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The twice Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile promoter for LGBT and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live freely without ramifications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world winner said that when he became in love with a man - a U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a surprise" to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When she went through so many things at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had had similarly beautiful and horrific experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all point of view" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, the important thing for me was 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the things he had asked for was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, pa'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd from my country at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the first selection of his song - Proud of Heather Small - which was compatible with him in the Olympics march and still ignited the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who is no longer in shape remains on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his shape to avoid being a not-so-joyful milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for a 12-time record, stayed on the bench from captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the center of action, as it was often for the United States, the big five-time winner shared his day between supporting and working on his game from a distance in the hope of rectifying his worries.
One who would never give the ball right even in the full of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult Le Golf National racetrack, where the long rough distance repeatedly punishes wrong shots.
And if the course alone is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, faces the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, new to the season, to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, by four points less than the start of the 12th single game, start well, Mickelson's game could prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, taped on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably wouldn't have seen him play two games.
I've seen more, but this is how it worked and this is how we thought it would go.
He needs to be out there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that would rather never reach the fullness of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought a few intangible things to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, humorous, likes to laugh at people, and a very good man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players enjoyed criticizing him, this week, which was something fun to watch.
It provides much more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn that the large front position could quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable front position before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans but ended up with a real narrow margin, with a win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"It reminds you that we had a big front position in Valderrama; we had a big front position in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with little," Bjorn said, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Class win 5-3 at NolL.
So the story will show me and everyone else in this team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll go with your body and soul.
Go out there and do all the good things.
It's not over until you've got the points on the team.
We have a goal, and what he is trying to hide is this trophy, and the focus will remain there.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what's on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Satisfied with how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go an oltrè pass by me in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different to do.
It's nice to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested for your full ability as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass on to the players, to get your best out tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner behind and he'll want to leave and get his best out of it, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, opposing number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of those last few days that can change everything, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up losing as Europe made the "Miracle of Medina."
"I remember to the very least a word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want to get to that start as soon as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw it in Medina.
When that momentum reaches one side, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We made our list properly and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we're trying to do a few miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and facing Roy McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers the whole way," said Bjorn about his singles choices.
Germany's new war has been postponed once again.
The newest German Navy frigate was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War frigates, but will not be there until at least next year due to systems with flaws and rising cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a spokesman for the military.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but the problematic post-delivery issues tainted the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships that ordered the Navy back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile display as well as some cautious technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signage.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, continued delays mean that the state-of-the-art ships - which named allow Germany to project power offshore - will already be aging by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Blohm <0x26> Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivering.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the ship is significantly overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
This is said to have reached a staggering amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest frigates become especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is waning.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy currently "has a shortage of ships that can withstand deployment."
The officer said that the problem has grown over time, because old ships have been commissioned but replacement ships have not been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is about the secret life of batsmen
New ground research being conducted in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when searching for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipitrelles and soprano as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Rice.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of bat calls and what species are doing what.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be produced which will create a detailed picture of their behavioural landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development work affecting nests and habitat loss.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, such as poisoned papers to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are currently not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ecolocalization technique to indicate insects and obstacles in their path when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threeve land in Dumfries and Galloway, sheltering eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeve we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have all the old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is much more about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what we need to flourish."
It stresses the importance of checking bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that the unintended destruction of a single maternity nest can kill up to 400 women and young, possibly destroying an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or annoy them or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Night Butterfly Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we still don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to look for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo remarked claims of rape against him as "fake news," saying people "have to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are expected to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid $375,000 at the time to say nothing about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagram Live with its 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, remarked the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner while looking at the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They have to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "a good man" disappointed with the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual intercourse, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified by retaliation" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now looking to reverse the solution as she is still being traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he played for Italian football legends Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK "will regret forever" the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was of "concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Auris and Toyota's Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concern relates to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line today operates on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border barriers that industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows, as I say, not just success to be enjoyed at present but to be able to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say for how long production would be halted, but in a longer period, warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union's defendant at the plant, said that his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience when these jobs leave, they never come back.
A spokesperson for the government said: "We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's risky meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's aids and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump is firing the deputy attorney general would jeopardize Mueller's independence, Washington has instigated rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, despite reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York, scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to expel Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a gag with a Senate judicial committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of their witnesses
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh over a period of one week, which further delayed a full Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "A date has not yet been set for this, it may be this week, and it may be the following week because of all the other matters going on with the supreme court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the picture up to date".
Some journalists dispute this assertion: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "trying to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more Q<0x26>A sessions than any president before him," she added without citing any evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
The meetings will still continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, this is by far better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this a lot and have seen it done many times over the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when he visits dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves in a relaxed and sometimes strange way in front of groups of journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to the EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and desire to remain there after Brexit.
MSP Jeane Freeman sent a letter when less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to defray the cost of definite status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government was also stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this is certainly an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to maintain now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, irrespective of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that reinforce and improve the work of the health service, and are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is absolutely your home and we wish you very much to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went on the sideline and like he fell there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a streaker and taking him to the rear for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer being operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "so far there is no detail on the type/extent of injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year of suspended university, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after leaving Illinois.
On Saturday he had a total of five tackles before leaving the game, which led to a total of 18 tackles of his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more on stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged more on stamp duty when buying property in the UK with the extra money used to help the homeless under new Tory plans
This change will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers must pay a higher stamp duty rate when buying property in the UK - with the extra money being used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-paying earners.
The stamp tax increase will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and firms in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's efforts to fight street sleep.
The additional charge - which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purpose purchases - may be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, increasing prices, making it more difficult for new buyers to make the first step in the housing purchase phases.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "phantom cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a stamp tax cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by seizing land and not using it, and urged Ms May to abandon quotas on affordable housing in order to rectify the "shameful housing situation" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including rent checks and the end of "no fault" dismissals.
He also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my office to reversing the dream of the UK - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that we are rebuilding the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and spend their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies find it as easy to buy homes as bustling UK residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too far away, and the dignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland head Jack Ross says his "fundamental ambition" is to one day become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scottish is taking on the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which is currently in third place in League One, by three points from the first.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and nothing more," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But when I was a kid I would often go with my father to see Scotland play in Hampden, and that's always the thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing a club."
Those who preceded Ross as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he did not worry about the fact that he would follow such established names at such a large club, while previously rejecting the offer from Barnsley City and Ipswich.
"At the moment, the success for me will be based on 'can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'"
Given the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy thing to get there, but I probably consider that I succeeded here only if I manage to get the club back there."
Ross has only three years in his career as a manager, after a period as chief assistants at Dumbarton and after spending 15 months with Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third category, transforming St Mirren from the relegation's edge to Championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he is now feeling more comfortable than he did during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Regarding when he took over Alloa, he recalled that "it was probably a big change."
"I really thought the post of manager was the most suitable one for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange because I was doing well, I had a decent living, and I enjoyed some reasonable gains.
However, playing games can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that you have to go through every week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and work pressure but simply feel that the post of manager is suitable for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel that throughout my adult life I'm now feeling the most comfortable."

A survey finds that the best time to take a pint of beer is at 5:30pm
The summer heat wave has boosted the profits of UK pubs in difficulty but put more pressure on the same company's restaurants.
In July, groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales - but figures revealed that restaurant earnings fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who collected the figures, said: "Continued Sun and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when sales at pubs increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade in June further worsened in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sales are drinks were the ones that performed best in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while restaurant sales decreased.
The pubs whose main selling is food have also suffered in the heat, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out drinking.
In managed pubs and bars sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food fell to three percent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts on entertainment and hospitality said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of take-away market sales.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly burdensome in addition to the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can advise us on whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including start-ups, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in start-ups.

One in five children have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in Insta's "fake" pages
News has great fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children - some at the young age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "Fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a presentable "key" account to show their parents, while having private ones.
A mother who met the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a young woman who was urging others to rape her - "rape me."
Research, from Digital Awareness UK and from independent schools' Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half admitting to holding private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics
Elidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most medal-winning and non-medal-winning track athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her vast experience at international level over the past decade.
"Elidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly as she becomes part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as a voice for athletes and hopefully I can really contribute and help drive sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular BBC critic, ended up not walking after suffering a minor stroke attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today I have a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can tell us whether I recover or not or to what extent.
It was hard work but I recovered completely, I learned how to dry again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
A breast pump advertisement comparing mothers to cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to differing opinions online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be the "world's first wearable, noise-proof breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an inspired ad from an ironic music video to showcase the freedom that the new breast pump gives to mothers who use it.
Four real mothers dance in a mattress filled with cow straw with a disc that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself but I don't have a tail" and "In case I haven't noticed these are not nipples but breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump out, pump out, I'm feeding my babies, pump out, pump out, I'm milking my women."
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 spectators and hundreds of comments, the video received different responses from viewers, many of whom say it sheds light on the dairy industry's "terrorists."
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision that cows used to advertise this product.
Like us they need to become pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their babies are taken to them within a few days of birth".

Another commented: "One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who hold their babies?"
Another added: "It's really a bit of a misunderstanding."
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting to having found the song "very entertaining."
"I think this is a genius idea.
If I were still in charge, I'd buy one.
The bump made me feel the same as a cow.
It's a bit of a paradise, but I've got it all figured out.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at pumping mothers (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feeling like 'cows'.
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they were all dancing with unsightly pumps placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump, making no noise, has no wire or tube and stays in a lactation bra without a glance, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who use the breast pump with dairy cows we wanted to focus on breast pumping and all the challenges it brings, while displaying in a fun and relateable way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring-
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Walked Without Words to a Tent Camp at the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply despite the fact that border crossings have remained unchanged every month, partly because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to put children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that if they presented themselves to care for a child they would jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their pets would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we are continuing to look for these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video teleconference, rather than in person, in order to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those considered ineligible for aid will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are held in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or distressed, which can lead to them expressing themselves violently or trying to escape.
Lawyers said that this concern increases in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is finding it difficult are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying health to their peers could lead to trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish "occupying forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be addressed accordingly."
"They should withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight this sacred battle until we expel all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were right for them to return, blaming "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to keep away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last powerful major rebel has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists including Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump won the second term of office.
With this logic, in 2020 Mr. Trump will win the re-election as long as, as many liberal viewers hope, the denunciation and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
It's definitely the "most dramatic finale ever in a presidency!"
So far, it seems that the viewers have not yet satisfied.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on time with the highest number of viewers, over 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has increased cable television ratings with even 3.5 million viewers in major news nights.
"This is a situation that is attracting people to it because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama programme "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Why are you bothering me?'," Mrs. Scovell told me.
In this chaos there is a value of entertainment.
Undoubtedly, unlike anything else on TV, the titles of the stories emanating from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when at the sixth you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of source "with a deep background" for his book "Fear," the T-shirt bomber with owls' skin.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what it's doing to make it as if it's a reality show is that every night it's going to get you something," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing cast and development in the daily plot of the program Jifong, a Trump.Nir (fight).
You can't afford to lose a single episode because otherwise it would fall back.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home the weather was sunny at 80 degrees on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be detached from the television front, not when there was Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when before we did those excitement programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were actually right."

Large amounts of money arriving from abroad for the toughest races in the White House midterm election
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's seventeenth congressional district is seeing a large amount of money, thanks to a realignment of congressional districts that have acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
This recently re-established the pits of Pittsburgh's suburban district Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is coming out as a candidate against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfuss, currently representing Pennsylvania's old twelve districts, spanning heavily over the new seventeen districts.
The maps were re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally tampered with in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new seventeenth district provoked a difficult contest of the financial campaign between the main party's finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) (Congressional Committee of the Democratic Campaign) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (National Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning with little difference in the March special election followed heavily for Pennsylvania's eighteenth Congressional District.
That seat was Republican's for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political critics gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considers punishing El Salvador for supporting China, then decides not to do so
The Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a welcoming meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until some partners fired the Trump Organization's administrative team.
State Department officials decided to re-contact U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama about the "recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, in a statement at the beginning of this month.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid, including narcotic controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included targeted cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and killing rates.
As internal meetings began to progress, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with a view to effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been strongly criticized for addressing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration puts on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and harsh message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke of the condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next unexpected adverse event could be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, about which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
It is reported that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation over whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that Congress passes to another person, Mr. Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares to go before voters again, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainties, and I have no intention of suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalent in Europe.
There are choices to be made from it on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We didn't succeed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Nowadays, the United States faces many of these challenges.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and speculated that he was unsuitable for the post.
Mr Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
"How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's newly requested FBI investigation is incomplete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual conduct and dishonest witnesses?
And above all, are we going to vote in midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, it will take time to move on to democracy.
But I don't think we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the home of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship, God sent me to light the candles on that table with swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of a competitive match with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, acknowledging that their victory against the Austrians, following the impressive equal result they brought to Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 result with Villarreal but he believes Rangers could use that result as a catalyst for great things.
"This was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We came to the game with the belief that we could achieve something and we came out with a point.
We probably won it at the end but, overall, an equal result was probably a fair one.
They were probably better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday is going to be a big European night again.
We hope to be able to get three points but this will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can continue to strive and achieve a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, between all that has happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but despite this there is now a sense of positivity.
The team is good and the boys are having a lot of fun; the training is going well.
I hope we can now do our best, forget the last season and be successful."
Women are concerned about this fear related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be looked after, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
"People want to be a caring family member, but they're not taking steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
You have to start that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes well ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a value of hybrid money in order to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth - provided you have the money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents at length: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a proxy for your finances.
Choose a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elder parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the finances that are involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times by air rifle in IIfracombe
A man was hit several times by an air rifle as he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, aged over forty, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when he was hit by gunshots to his chest, abdomen and arms.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
With faults in the communication lines, aid officers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala retreat, which is an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake's epicentre with a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a retreat that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The reversal, an administrative region under a province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Ring of Fire of the Pacific and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 struck southern Java, which is Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit with great force the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre-high tsunami that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's reversal in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily isolated thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Child Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when female acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her hand.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly, not guilty" when asked to give his plea, the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A offences, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and have to pay a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with an attack on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime, and having a weapon in his possession while drunk in connection with the incident.
His wife claimed to have slapped him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after a comparison was made between her son's violent behavior and the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck just slightly outside the centre of Sulawesi located in the northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On the media are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that the suspect of the NYC terrorist attack be given a rare death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov who is suspected in the terrorist attack on New York City that killed eight people be sentenced to death - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, flying pedestrians and cyclists who happened to be on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to claim the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of accusation carry with them a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed Saipov 22 indictments that included eight counts of murder with the help of organised reinvigoration, typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a count of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Describing the way in which Saipov carried out this "sick, cruel and immoral" attack, prosecutors said the attack required "substantial prior planning and meditation."
The notice of intent states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrucchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Aandolej".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced in September 2009 to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being found guilty of conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he inspired himself to carry out the attack after he watched ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the indictment's head.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "definitely disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to request the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilty for life in prison with no possibility of release will continue to only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team has previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised that he would "mobilize the army of the people" .
The former head of the Ukip said politicians had to "feel pressured" by Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party government member Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that by now the UK "would have come out" if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Ms May to reconcile her deeply divided positions has been highlighted by a not-pro-Brexit tories who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers' compromise plan on track amid attacks by Brexiteers, anti-Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that despite the negative reaction it would continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the "chaos".
Mr Bone told the rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "put aside Chequers' plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a high social position and should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would have been out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will defend Brexit but we need to put aside Chequers' plan."
When he declared that he is against the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We have to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is absolutely untrue."
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexiteer, was also present at the demonstration, telling reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are really the ones who go to the streets and vote for us first.
Please forget Chequers' plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Ms May, she said: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel under pressure" that they would otherwise be back from the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to go back from Brexit and we are here today to tell them that 'we are not going to leave you smooth if you do this'."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of coming back from Brexit.
We are mobilising in Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and we will not spend until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK."
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the group's launch this weekend, a small number of activists have tended to banners with the writing Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit).
Lord Adonis, who holds a high social position in the Labour party, mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with the party's app as it opened the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems and technology in place for Canada and more, for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full-fledged.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "carefully examine" the possibility of running for presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections she will "carefully examine the possibility of running for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future in a debate with citizens at a municipal level in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will stand for re-election in November against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked her if she intended to stand for the presidential election.
Warren responded that it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and this includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU Sims
Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the killing of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims that took place on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
Friday they released a video of the shooting, in which they asked for help in identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media "Wayde Sims suffered from a head injury and eventually died as a result."
Wayde came in to defend his companion and was hit by a shot from Simpson.
Simpson was asked questions and admitted that he was on the scene, that he had a weapon, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and held in custody at the East Parish Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a six-foot youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is set to win the world title after his team's orders gave him the victory against Sebastian Vettel
Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Bottas had a good advantage and nearly abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his fellow.
Vettel was the first to enter the stop zone and allowed Hamilton to climb with the others to the group's final spot, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the stop zone after another lap and exited just behind Vettel, but Hamilton went on after a little wheel-to-wheel action that led the Ferrari driver to difficultly leave the inside free due to the risk of falling back after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place until the end of the first lap on his birthday at the age of 21.
Then he was ahead for most of the race by not changing his tyres with the aim of finishing quickly and jumping Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually entered the stop zone in the 44th lap but was unable to step up his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen entered fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a very good job throughout the weekend and he was a real gentleman saying let me by.
The team has done a really exceptional job to get first and second place," said Hamilton.
That Was a Really Wrong Physical Attitude
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not reveal the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address directly the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "vile and nasty and not sincere."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are enraged and vile and nasty and not sincere," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosures of information and then say 'No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you disclosed any information?
Remember her answer... unveiled the document - "e, e, e, what is it?
No you don't see.
I didn't reveal anything."
Look, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and this was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she requested."
But her denial appears to have been dismissed by the president, who commented during Saturday evening's rally: "You know what, that was a really bad physical attitude.
It may not have been revealed, but that's the worst physical attitude I've ever seen."
While continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by whatever means necessary.
You're seeing the virginity, the disgruntled, they don't care who hurts, who sticks him in the wheels to gain power and control," the president said according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against Belfast Giants by winning the match against the same opponent 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained an advantage of two goals early in the game with two attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie earned the same score for the team playing in his home country before Dwyer regained an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard earned the same score for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
It was the third win of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe players, who after several losses advanced to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams had met, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal took place in the fourth minute at 3:35 at a pace by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the pass while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a multi-action opening period, Sullivan brought his home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave a pass to Cownie at 15:16 bringing the same score for both teams.
Dwyer ensured that Giants gain an advantage until the first break of the game when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The team that is playing in his home country was reunited and thanks to Bouchard they reached the other team again with a strong goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-time advantage in the game at the end of the second period and secured the fifth goal win for his team in the middle of the final period.
Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds of People Aboard Airplane Can Escape Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being seen as a hero after he died to ensure that an airplane carrying hundreds of people manages to land safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have been lost after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Heavy earthquakes have continued to dominate the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawaan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower swinging at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at that time on the runway, could safely depart.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan in order to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about this, we feel a lot of sadness," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under the rubble while many were unattainable," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have destroyed Palu, where mass burials will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings in the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "Indonesia's Red Cross is working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night in order to complete any task related to the evacuation.
Ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that was operating a flight that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, having previously said that the 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, she could not give details on the whereabouts of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon just off the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overstepped the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had come very low.
"That's a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to pass through the water that was high up to their waist until the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working nearby to improve a wharf also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents but no accident involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents timeline of the evening in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday concluded its evidence on the case in the new trial of a man who is accused of burning down a woman from Mississippi in 2014 while she was alive.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to gather information about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the mobile phone data showed that he was with Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city at the time.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was in the Sanford truck, Sanford said that he was "liing, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, phone calls and contact information from his mobile phone.
"He took it from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to pass to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Three hip hop artists want to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, by Bristol, claim that hip hop has gone beyond its origins of political messaging and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make again the popular conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
"Another black person?"
Nanny from NY sues a couple for dismissing her after a "racist" message
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a mistaken message from her mother who complained she was "another black person."
The couple denies being racist, and compares the cause to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed regret when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was of a dark carnage when she arrived for the first day of work in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEEEEE OTHER SEWDAY PERSON," Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her gross mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that her predecessor, who was African-American, had not done her job well and that instead she was waiting for the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation in relation to the dismissal, and is seeking compensation of $350 a day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, despite being without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do such things," she told Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the statements that they are racist, saying that the dismissal of Mrs. Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent me something that she had no intention of saying.
She's not racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone who has spoken to you grossly, even if it was by mistake?
your child's birth?
And come on."
Comparing the case to an "extortion", Plasco said it had only been two months since his wife had given birth and she was "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to blame someone like that?"
It's not a good thing to do," added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly announced the couple on social media, insulting them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it was published.
"It's really fun to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book by a small toy bear, would surely have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "pleasant but darkened his death a little bit."
About Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he never kept talking about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't full of himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child to get something: be proud of them even if it wasn't you to have gotten something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he always gave the merit to Paddington's own."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her my last hello on the phone
Her daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors worked to save her life but it was all in vain.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to live," said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a phone call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give her my last goodbye.
And so I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heartbeat were slowing down and leaving her system slow.
She had died some time before and began to collapse all over.
All I could do was sit back and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by people and families.
I really had to hold back."
Eventually Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who had been weeping for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were not aware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a headache, and tears began to fall.
It's hard to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Post cards of distressed women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been affixing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs Davis's son, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
He always said that his smile would light up every room."
However, he had to quit work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I am always afraid that this will be the cause of another ugly event."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people you can open your heart to or meet, even as a friend.
Don't be silent - you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
"He wasn't saying he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened their gifts he didn't make any eye contact with them or anything like that."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they want to fight her: "Leave a void in the family.
It separates us.
But we all have to live our lives and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in a precarious situation as the FBI begins an investigation
"I said, if we could achieve something like what he asked for - a limited investigation in time, limited in purpose - maybe we would have brought a little unit," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "crashing" amid a partisan paralysis that had taken root.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due entirely to the choice of time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do not go well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was picking up the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats occupy the position.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea "decreases" under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters for South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the ministry for the unification of the South, Park Byeong-seug, said there were 1,127 party changes last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters from the North are virtually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Many escape by passing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China sees deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly sends them back home.
Relations between the North and the South - still technically at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were focused on the stalemate of denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-safe Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress made since.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, we will in no way be the first to unilaterally disarm," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," while saying he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Mr Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he is unable to work in the Supreme Court due to his temperamental behavior.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think in the fact that if a woman had ever behaved that way, they would have said 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and choking when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organised by the liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he has anti-Democratic biases.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi moved when asked whether she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if confirmed, and whether Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say something -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, so he's not capable, not just to be in the Supreme Court, but even to be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal of D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is considered a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change certain Supreme Court rulings.
"It's inappropriate for a person with hysterical biases to go to court and wait to say, 'Very well,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to exercise their authority.
It's a fair verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and she can't say what to say without crying.
"We cry when we grow up," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, what do you say?"
She added, "I helped a lot of a woman who was spotted somewhere else, who said that she too was crying when she was bummed, but developed a technique that meant that when she was bummed and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'You're probably thinking you're upset because I'm crying.
I'm pissed."
And then it didn't stop.
And I thought that was something brilliant."
Crying is allowed as a way of venting one's great anger partly because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs I had, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with indescribable rage, was when an older woman grabbed me by the necklace - a cold manager I had always feared - and carried me to the...
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're being bullied.
They think you're upset and they feel happy that they've managed to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was running for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a boat known as Monkey Business and exited the election, Mrs. Schroeder, greatly enraged, concluded that there was no reason why she would not explore the idea of coming out herself for the presidential election.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going to stand for election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Somebody called it "Snow White and the Seventh Nani."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was back in fundraising, so she swore she wouldn't stand for election unless she made $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who would give $1,000 to the men to her would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm taking some discount?" she said.
When she made her speech announcing that she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, enraged by the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters instead of delegates, and enraged at sexism - that she was stifled.
"You'd probably think I had a strong hold on them," Mrs Schroeder reminded me of the way the media reacted to her.
"I used to think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my grave?
"She cried?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The numbers of aerial bombings of the opening of the U.S.-China trade war have been daunting, and while the battle is still to end, a lack of agreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave a first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods totaling $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in the same way, while more recently it has been presenting tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to agree with the United States every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will surrender in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means accepting the demands, but publicly the fact that China surrenders to the United States will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, U.S. trade war pressures could support China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to start economic chaos in both countries is actually much more dangerous than what spectators previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research partner who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security (Center for New American Security), is a li' group.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the sedition.
Europe celebrates the victory of the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points it needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson who is pre-eminent in the United States, who struggled throughout the entire tournament, gave his tit-up in the water in the 16th hole par-3, ceding his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming 1 out of 4 players who have ever brought in a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5<0x26>4 against the lowest-level player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-level player, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who played in his final Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European player to ever be here with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't hold on.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas who chose me and who believed in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that I got back the cup.
The team is everything, and I'm happy to have been able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot partner John Ram who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in a Sunday play singles.
"The incredible pride that I feel, that I won Tiger Woods, when I was raised to follow him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 throughout his career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players ever, who won 14 main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to find those parts of the track where golf is played with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put some pressure on Europe.
Arguing we.
Thomas took off the hat.
He is a very good master.
His 12 players played very well.
We will rejoin, I will work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be a master.
You'll have to pick up the cape and tilt your head.
Play better than that."
