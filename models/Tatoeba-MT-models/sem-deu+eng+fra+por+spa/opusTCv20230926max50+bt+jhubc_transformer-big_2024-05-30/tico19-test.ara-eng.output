Rapidly increasing cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK, confirming that although the stage varies by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, states, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown pathogens were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent, the novel coronavirus, is now referred to as SARS-CoV-2.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far is that nearly 80 percent of individuals with COVID-19 have mild illness; that is, they have respiratory infections with or without symptoms, and most of these recover.
In approximately 14%, COVID-19 has escalated to a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% suffer from a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients who stayed in hospital due to COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends of the cumulative number of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK (UK) and compare them with those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After what happened in China, COVID-19 has spread increasingly geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following the dynamics of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed European cases of COVID-19 as defined by the World Health Organization.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 of people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported as of 31 December 2019, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative rate of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the numbers of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health bodies and the World Health Organization, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative number of intermittent COVID-19 cases over 14 days, and then took into account the normal course of COVID-19, in all EU/EEA countries and the UK, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of reported cases from each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases truncated over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and the UK followed the trends for Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 began to increase on approximately 21 February, then increased sharply on approximately 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar trends of increase to the cumulative number of COVID-19 (supplementary substance).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Highlights that as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., another 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported the total number of cases already comparable to that found in Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, national public health responses vary, and that different country definitions and protocols can vary to select patients to be tested for COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation where nearly 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospital admissions and/or intensive care units for COVID-19 cases are currently available at the EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not displayed).
However, they need to be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed great diversity in the availability of ICU beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios associated with saturation of health care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalized risk of 90% overcrowding of intensive care beds, are available in the sixth update of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s rapid COVID-19 risk assessment.
Because cases have been compiled so far in certain regions in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and ICUs typically serve specific regional populations, information on cases and ICU beds is best provided at the regional unit designation level 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.
States, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for a sustainable community-based SARS-CoV-2 transition scenario and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, such as that occurring in affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with a shift from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is limited opportunity for countries to step up their surveillance efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
If this fails, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
SARS-CoV-2, similar to the SARS-CoV virus, which caused thousands of people to contract SARS in 2003, can also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmissible and impactful among older people than young people and men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications related to emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review on a rapidly evolving research topic.
We will address the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, predictions of disease progression, and prevention.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help understand and eliminate the disease that poses a threat.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors throughout the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to an outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the Coronavirus (COV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the disease associated with CoV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country, as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has led to 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 dying.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is “public enemy <0x23>1” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease, since the first report was issued on 7 January 2020 from several patients that identified the sequence of the isolated virus.
This review aims to summarize research progress in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by Cove, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding disease prevention and prediction as well as some of the pressing questions that remain.
Coronaviruses are commonly considered to be non-fatal pathogens in humans, and have mainly caused about 15% of the four common colds.
In this century, however, we have faced severe human-causing coronaviruses twice, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and the disease quickly spread to many other countries at a horrific rate of prevalence and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, groups with pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported by Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, infections were reported among health care providers, suggesting the disease could be transmitted from person to person.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was closed with all public transport shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, which considered the site of infection initiation to be from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation develops rapidly, the final extent and seriousness of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has affected people of all ages, but mainly those between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half of those infected (47.7%) were over 50 years of age, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread among groups mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of infection to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproductive number (baseline reproductive number) was 3.77 (95% confidence range: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted baseline reproductive number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected has increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the many travels ahead of China’s Spring Festival.
The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (confidence range 95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (confidence range 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and acute pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a class of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single-sequence RNA genome.
It can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, and is known to infect humans with alpha and beta sexual coronaviruses.
The coated fork (S) of glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors ACE2 and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DBB4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, the genomic RNA, accompanied by glycosphere proteins and nucleated capsid proteins, forms vesicles containing ferions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% of the 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than Mers-CoV.
Transmission electron microscopy revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is present in very thin sections of the human airway epithelium.
Angiotensin-2-converting human enzyme has been discovered to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-2 converting enzyme weaker than SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also create a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a protein secreted by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and limit expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not have any range or pattern with a known function.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported the full-length structure of the human ACE-2 enzyme under an ultra-cold electron microscope with a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> within a compound with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had assembled to form a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind to the S protein, providing evidence for the identification of coronavirus and infection.
Sodium-based neutral amino acid transporter may become a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediate host
It has been known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
By comparing the ancestral development of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2, with the new virus 96% matching SARS-like bat viruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the cross-species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the pathway of transmission has not yet been clarified.
J et al. suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involved symmetric recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that squamous ant-eaters – long-tongued ant-eaters mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine – are the host of a potential SARS-CoV-2 mediator based on a 99% genetic homology in the coronavirus detected in squamous ant-eaters and sarcophagus.
However, the 1% difference spread across two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, we await conclusive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and humidity between 40 and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to UV rays and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at a concentration of 75%, chlorine-containing disinfectants, pyroxene acetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorooxide, can effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2, so they are more likely to be infected with the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been received.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies that relate to other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, the normal immune system recognizes it through pattern recognition receptors (PRRS), including type C receptors similar to leukocytes, TLR-like receptors, nucleotide-binding (NLR)-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through different pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammatory agents, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate large macrophage cells for viral antigens.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response quickly joins the fight against the virus.
T-cells, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B>, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill the cells infected with the virus directly.
T-assisted cells produce stimulant cytokines for inflammation to help the defending cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce T-cell function by inducing programmed death of T-cells.
Mixed immunity, including complementary proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential in the fight against viral infections.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovering MERS-CoV patient were neutralized.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, multi-organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is more likely to affect elderly people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is damaged to be more likely to become infected than others.
The average estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, or usually 3-7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed an incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, and then prevent people who are infected but not symptomatic from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to undergo quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, and can be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal puffiness, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acid, and thrombopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be screened, even without imaging that reveals lung abnormalities, for early diagnosis of the virus.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group that contracted infection from an asymptomatic person.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERC-CoV patients also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed much more respiratory support than COVID-19 patients and were consistent with the higher MERS death rate than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%–100%), dry cough (29%–75%), shortness of breath (40%–42%), diarrhea (20–25%), and sore throat (13–25%) were the most important symptoms, and respiratory support was required for about 14%–20% of patients.
By 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, while confirmed cases were 66,576 globally.
By comparison, by November 2002, the SARS mortality rate was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 baseline reproductive number was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence range (CA) from 5.71 to 7.23, while the SARS-CoV baseline reproductive number ranged from only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their specific symptoms, mortality rate, and baseline reproductive number is shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is far more difficult to control than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The onset of the disease often occurs in the same family or from the same group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or of contacting people or patients within the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovered patients who have been discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending an alarm to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (particularly lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphocyte deficiency was detected with a 4<0xC3><0x97>109/l white blood cell count including 1<0xC3><0x97>109/l lymphocyte count, and elevated levels of amine transporter aspartate and blood virus in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients increased, and the C-reactive protein and the rate of erythrocyte heaviness in the blood of most patients increased.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer D, which is caused by fibrin breaking down in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes decreased gradually.
Imaging dysfunctions appear in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double patchy shades or opacity of glazed glass in the lungs.
Patients sometimes have atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Type 1 and type 2 lung cell dysfunction reduces the level of surface activator and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst results of chest radiography and the maximum severity of the disease are often combined.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed lung cell dandruff, healin membrane formation, interstitial lymphatic infiltration, and multinuclear cellular cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, in line with the pathology of viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome. It is similar to what happens to patients with severe respiratory distress.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PT-PCR) has been used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negative outcomes, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations of diagnosis (which is no longer individually dependent on RT-BCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and imaging discoveries is essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Chang Group described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based Sherlock technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, detecting fragments of synthetic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 at a rate of 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mL to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mL.
We hope that the new technology can significantly improve sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can provide supportive care mainly for COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of treatments that have been used or suggested previously to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These include current and potential antiviral treatments, immunosuppressants, stimulants, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and antiviral vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first, and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that release angiotensin-2-converting enzyme, such as the digestive tract, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the most serious threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-invasive respirators, and invasive respirators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storm is known to result from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in acute cases.
Anabolic hormones, tocilizumab, and a monoclonal antibody anti-interleukin 6 have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include T-cell-driven immune response modification; blockade of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of janos kinase; blenatumomab; inhibition of cytokine 4 signals; and histon decetilase inhibitors.
Steroids and immunosuppressants have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in larger doses were not beneficial with severe lung infection in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it may cause severe side effects, especially avascular bone necrosis, which severely affects the prediction of the course of the disease.
However, short cycles of stimulant hormones in small to medium doses have been recommended with caution for cases of critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no antiretroviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, it was found that the intravenous administration of remedesevir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remedesevir also showed potential inhibition of other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these viruses, Guiliad provided the compound to China for some experiments on individuals with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, parisitinib, interferon-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these therapies with other medications used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and the generation of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from developing the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovering patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (IG) produced by B-Lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects, and they directly recognize and neutralize the unique molecules in pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation, viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to bring this method to widespread use before specific treatments can be found.
In addition, due to therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine-release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxic.
Blood antibody concentrations are usually low, and plasma demand is high for treating patients with critical conditions.
Specific antibodies are difficult to develop and produce quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, isolating B cells from recovering patients and identifying the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies, or screening for effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus, is more decisive and practical.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are highly dependent on a combination of multiple components in a combination that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or obscure as they are difficult to extract and check for these ingredients or their optimal formulations.
Currently, due to a lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of Xu Feng Ji Do capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules for the treatment of COVID-19 has been discovered.
The highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Ganzhou (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM with only about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this comparison is quite approximate, as many other influence factors such as the number of patients and the severity of their conditions should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Pauli Zhang and his co-workers published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicine (WM) alone with the combination of Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the time taken to recover from an elevated body temperature, the removal of symptoms, and hospital stays were significantly shorter in the Western Medicine <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to the Western Medicine only treatment group.
Most impressively, the rate of worsening symptoms (ranging from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the Western Medicine <0x2B> TCM treatment group compared to the Western Medicine only treatment group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western Medicine <0x2B> TCM treatment group compared to the Western Medicine only treatment group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still awaiting more well-researched trials on larger scales and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of procedures and clarify the effective ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 often fear a highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people under quarantine feel bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by anabolic hormones, can lead to more anxiety and mental disorder.
In the early stage of the SARS outbreak, a range of mental illnesses were reported including permanent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
Tracking mandatory contacts and quarantines, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatizing their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care needs to be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected COVID-19 patients, people in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and plans for its treatment, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact with one another.
Effective vaccines to cut off the chain of transmission of the virus from animal repositories and infected humans to vulnerable hosts are necessary and often complementary to antiviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-term and/or protective antibodies against SARS-CoV.
Attenuated live vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS treatment.
However, the efficacy of these in-vitro candidate vaccines in elderly and lethal challenge models and in their prevention of animal virus infection has not been determined prior to the start of a clinical study.
This is probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and populations of MERS continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other areas due to the continued presence of animal resources in endemic areas.
Immunization strategies against MERS have been developed using inactive viruses, deoxyribonucleic acid plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and subunits of recombinant protein, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is a challenge because of the length of time (average of 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of coronaviruses.
COVID-19, as a novel disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without consequences.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high prevalence rates and mortality in severe cases.
Building a prognosis model is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-limited areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis for COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for determining SARS predictions, which also applies to COVID-19.
Age groups aged 30 to 65 were mainly infected with COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to develop underlying concomitant diseases and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (at an average age of 66 vs. 51), indicating age as a predictive factor for COVID-19 outcomes.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Concomitant Diseases and Complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac accidents were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive bile cells with angiotensin-2 converting enzyme, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
Age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and may overlap.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of reactive protein C (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and has been suggested to be a predictive factor for disease, treatment response, and final recovery.
The association between the C-reactive protein level and the severity of COVID-19 and its prognosis was also proposed.
In addition, a rise in the enzyme extractor of lactate hydrogen (LDH), aspartate amine transporter (AST), alanine amine transporter enzyme (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of dysfunctions in the heart or liver.
Main clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and the gradual progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to predict the results of COVID-19 and its complications.
Use of anabolic steroids: As described above, anabolic steroids are commonly used as an adjunctive treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high-dose anabolic steroid hormones have been widely used in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered avascular osteoporosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short time in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced exceptional stress; they often endured prolonged periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close family members and sick colleagues.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to lower respiratory reenactment, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reenact the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, causing difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission has been considered to occur when patients are in a severe condition, while most transmissions of the virus did not occur in the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Exercise efforts are currently underway in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of hindering the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have greatly damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the recession will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others have estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. established a model for predicting the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in medium and throat oyster swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a flu-like periodic seizure.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually controlled through strict quarantine and isolation measures.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 becomes weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually disappears or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemics of SARS and MERS is presented below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in the stool, raising a new possibility of passing from the stool to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be due to hospital infections, including 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, great precautions are needed to protect human beings, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even passers-by who have communicated with sick or infected people.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; using both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from moving through the air or sticking to the surfaces of the material, as they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of small virions of between 10 and 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 resembles SARS-CoV in size and is approximately 85 nm each.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks in tandem together, healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers must wear appropriate insulation robes to further reduce communication with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face protectors or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with more antiseptic soap than usual, and try to stay at home for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is a good distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its strong resemblance to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 would have triggered a high alert in China based on its deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control did not reassure citizens until 19 January 2020, saying that the new virus has a low rate of infection and limited human-to-human reproduction and there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message severely underestimated the public's alertness, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and critical time was wasted to contain the disease at its lowest range in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious when issuing public statements because every word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than attempting to periodically reassure the public; and (4) more targeted and effective public training is being issued.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
It has spread in less than two months across China and around 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has triggered a feeling of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and the rate of severity and mortality is also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually do this when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Normal DNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can be infected with the virus again.
These results significantly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With this rapid progress in research on COVID-19, there are still many critical issues to be solved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of 96% genetic symmetry between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we can’t stop the transition efficiently, and the outbreak could come back at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-2-converting enzyme, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to the enzyme-converting cells of angiotensin 2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic continue?
How does the virus develop genetically during its transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, or will it fade like SARS, or will it come back periodically like the flu?
It is necessary but may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and many other questions.
However, at any cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normal.
Animal Origins of Human Coronaviruses
The mutation and adaptation have been driving the co-evolution between coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, it was known that two types of human coronavirus (HPV) cause mild illness, such as a cold.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have shown the other side to reveal how severe and life-threatening the infection of human coronaviruses can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 has re-emphasized coronaviruses and surprised us with its rapid spread but with a disease-causing potential compared to its brother SARS-CoV.
The human coronavirus is an animal-borne disease, so our understanding of the animal origins of human coronaviruses would serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they were not pathogenic.
The intermediate repository hosts of some human coronaviruses have also been known.
Identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating the interactions between the coronavirus and the host in animals also provides an important insight into the emergence of coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the available information about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on their history of discovery as well as their animal origins and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and predict different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
In this context, the disease caused by the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed.
In addition, it also highlights the successful switching requirements of the host and the impact of complications of virus development on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses (Coronaviruses) belong to the family of coronaviruses, comprising a group of encapsulated viruses with a single-sequence RNA positively directed.
These viruses contain the largest genome of RNA viruses, 26 to 32 kilobases, and are called "coronaviruses" because their structure resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of synthetic properties, coronaviruses contain unfragmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading templates (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted to the replicated polyprotein types pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiple proteins are further processed to generate 16 nonstructural proteins, referred to as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remaining part of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including spike (S), shell (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Various strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of additional proteins from special strains.
Based on variation in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-viruses), including beta-coronaviruses that include most human coronaviruses and are divided into four strains (A, B, C, and D).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents act as the genetic origin of most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the primary repository of gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently bypassed species barriers and some have emerged as dangerous human pathogens.
Seven human coronaviruses (Human Coronaviruses) are known to date.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, both of which belong to the alpha-Coronaviruses.
The other five beta coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds, diarrhea, or both.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in more patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and non-pulmonary symptoms.
HCoV-229E, the first strain B814, was isolated from nasal secretions of patients with a cold in the mid-1960s.
Much of the information has since been gathered through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, whose symptoms heal spontaneously.
In fact, it was generally accepted that HCoV infection was harmless until an SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is among the deadliest epidemics in our present history, with more than 8,000 people infected with approximately 10% deaths.
Ten years later, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) spread, creating a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel human coronavirus (2019 novel human coronavirus), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current epidemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on 3 March 2020.
The alarm bell rings and the world must prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracking the animal origins of human coronaviruses has shown a framework for understanding natural history, the driving force and the limiting factors of interspecies mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 repository, intermediate host and amplified host animal, with important effects to prevent future fallout.
In this review we provide an overview of animal origins, interspecies transmission, and human coronaviruses causing diseases.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that the native viruses of human coronaviruses are usually non-pathogenic in their natural repository hosts but become pathogenic after cross-species transmission to a new host.
We also review the evaluation of the pathway of HCoV where an increase in its transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in the severity of pathogenicity.
We are also discussing in this context the consequences of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from nasal secretions of cold patients, various types of HCoVs were isolated from a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decades, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) will be educational and indicative.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, after which it adapted to live in the ranks of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat, with a fever and cough in about 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and was subsequently transferred into the brains of infant mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be distinguished by symptoms from other respiratory infections such as influenza A viruses and nasal viruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread globally, and tend to spread during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a feeling of illness for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, the infection of healthy individuals with HCoV-229E has caused a mild cold.
Only a few immunodeficient patients showed severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history and its triggering agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the super-vector, it has been estimated that a single case of infection can lead to approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Symptoms of SARS-CoV begin with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise, and chills, followed as late symptoms by difficulty breathing, coughing and respiratory distress.
Lymphocytosis, liver dysfunction, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory dysfunctions of SARS.
In SARS patients, diffuse alveolar damage is also observed, proximal cell proliferation, and an increase in the number of phagocytes.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, in severe cases many organs can also be affected, including the digestive tract, liver, and kidneys, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be particularly fatal in immunodeficient patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on the human coronavirus.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, the elderly, and immunodeficient patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the virus itself from a sample of the nose of an 8-month-old baby with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although discovered in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, peaking during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as strangulation.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbations of acute asthma attacks.
HCoV-HKU1 has been found to be globally widespread, causing mild respiratory diseases, similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and generally have little chance of mutating to diseases with high prevalence rates, but the coincidence occurred for unknown reasons, such as in the rare case of the most ferocious subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
In general, when these coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and sustain themselves consistently within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Mers-Cove was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, in many European countries and Tunisia cases have been reported from abroad and rare secondary transmission of close personal contacts.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms caused by MERS are similar to those caused by SARS, and are characterized by severe exacerbated pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many people with MERS have also suffered severe kidney failure, which is what distinguishes MERS from other HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases with a high mortality rate of 34.4% were reported, making Mers-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From mid-December to late 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients later known to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2 as an international public health emergency as it has called COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases had been confirmed worldwide, with an initial death rate of 3.4%.
The death rate in Hubei province in China is 4.2 percent, while outside it is 1.2 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea also appears in some injured people.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homogeneity of the nucleotide sequence by 82%, they belong to different branches in the tree of evolution.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic people have been reported despite being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may be contributing to its rapid spread around the world.
A comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses revealed similarities and differences of great importance.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in incubation and disease time.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 infection falls between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 features are more common in cases of community-acquired human coronaviruses, including the appearance of unspecified or minor symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as SARS-CoV, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the transmissibility of HCoVs acquired from society.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission to humans, as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the oral anal route plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV at least in some cases.
Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 may show seasonal prevalence, as is the case with community-acquired human coronaviruses.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including possible transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable post-transmission spread to humans will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-acquired human coronaviruses causing minor symptoms have adapted well to humans.
Another perspective, which may also be true, is that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both may be survivors of the old HCoV epidemics.
The human coronaviruses that afflict humans with acute diseases, as well as humans who have been infected with acute human coronavirus diseases, have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans enough to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that face host constraint factors.
Based on this logic, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it is difficult to stop its transmission between humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread among human populations over many years, causing colds in people with good immunity.
These viruses do not need an animal repository.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to humans, and could not continue to transmit between humans.
They need to stay and breed in their animal repositories and then look for the right opportunity to move on to the most vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from society.
It is highly contagious like human coronaviruses acquired from the community, at least for now.
However, it causes more infections than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet clear whether it will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a repository or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, repository, intermediate, and amplified hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal plays the role of an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it harbors the closely related origin of the virus and shares significant symmetry in the level of nucleotide sequences.
The virus of origin is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic to this host.
Similarly, the host host hosts the reservoir continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
By contrast, if the HCoV enters the intermediate host recently before or near its attack on humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes morbidity.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and also plays the role of an amplified host by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and thus transmit it to humans to expand the range of infection among humans.
The HCoV infection may reach an impasse if the virus fails to transmit from within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host so that they may settle for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural repository host.
Epidemiological data later revealed that the first case of SARS had a history of contact with prey.
Seroprevalence surveys afterwards indicated that animal dealers had a higher prevalence rate of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to ordinary people.
It was first determined that the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog on live animal markets carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS were reported after all the civets were killed in the market.
However, it has been reported that the result of SARS-CoV screening in masked palm civets living in the wild or on farms without exposure to live animal markets was largely negative, suggesting that masked palm civet may be only an intermediate amplified host, but not the natural repository of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals also act as the amplifying intermediate host of SARS-CoV is not excluded.
It seems that all of these are hosts that do not transmit SARS-CoV.
Later research into SARS-CoV's natural animal host led to the detection of the closely related bat coronavirus, which is called the HKU3-associated red horse-hoof bat virus (HKU3-associated red horse-hoof bat virus), which is found in the HKU3-associated red horse-hoof bat virus.
The result of SARS-CoV antibody testing in these bats and the HKU3-associated red horse-hound bat genome sequence was positive.
This virus and other bat coronaviruses share 88-92% similarity of nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-like coronaviruses) have been identified from bats, but none have been able to be isolated as a living virus except for WIV1.
The human angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 extracted from a bat stool sample was shown to use angiotensin-2 converting enzyme in bats, civet cats, and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, serum recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome had the potential to equate to WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the most closely related SARS-CoV origin in bats, as they share 95% similar nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high symmetry between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the SARS-CoV direct parent virus and that bats are not a SARS-CoV direct host.
The analysis of the evolution of the Mers-Cove strains in the group of coronavirus-HKU4 in bats and coronavirus-HKU5 in bats themselves combines.
The HKU4 virus in bats and MERS-CoV uses the same host receptor, a peptidyl dipeptidase4 (peptidyl dipeptidase4), to enter the virus.
The RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are closer in societal evolution to their beta-coronavirus counterparts in bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Mers-Cove lives in wild bats.
Mers-Cove and HKU25 virus share in their closest bats a similar nucleotide sequence of only 87%.
Thus, bats may not be the direct host of the Mers-Cove warehouse.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single camels are serum positive for MERS-CoV-equivalent antibodies, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, which is identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of the dromedary camels, suggesting that the camels act as the host of the original MERS-CoV repository.
It is also worth noting that minor symptoms generally appeared in camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, but a dense viral dispersion was observed.
Infected camels were noticeably spreading viruses not only through breathing but also through the oral anal route, which is the primary route for virus scattering from bats.
However, questions remain because many confirmed cases of MERCOSUR have no history of camel contact prior to the onset of symptoms, and these cases have been logically attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown modes of transmission involving unidentified animal species harboring MERCOSUR.
SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus RaTG13 is involved in bats isolated from horseshoe bats with 96.2% nucleotide symmetry.
The sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too long to determine the relationship with the father, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
This means bats may not be the direct host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless bat coronaviruses are found almost identical in the future.
SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts are presumed to be among the wildlife species that were sold and killed at the Wuhan Seafood Market, with which many initial cases of COVID-19 have been linked, suggesting a possible transmission from animal to human.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as squash ants (Manis javanica) could also harbor beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this ant-borne novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share a similar nucleotide sequence of 85-92%.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of nucleotide sequences.
Two sub strains of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses are clustered in the evolutionary tree of strains, one of which shares a similar receptor binding area (receptor binding area) with SARS-CoV-2, with amino acid sequences corresponding to 97.4%.
In stark contrast, the receptor binding areas of SARS-CoV-2 differ significantly from RaTG13, although the whole genome sequence is higher.
A previous study on a sick squash ant-eater also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, and it turned out that they were similarly linked to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different synthesis methods and manual processing to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of a full-length viral genome by approximately 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the squash ants may be one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 in squamous ants due to variation in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-coronaviruses in squamous ants.
In addition, the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-coronaviruses in squash ants.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, squash ants, and other mammals is still under investigation.
While the highest serial symmetry has been found in the receptor binding areas of SARS-CoV-2 and squash ant, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13-associated beta-coronaviruses share the highest symmetry of the whole genome sequence.
A predominant speculation is that the high degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding areas of the beta-coronavirus squash ant and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective convergent evolution.
There is a counter-proposal that suggests recombination between SARS-CoV-2 in beta-coronavirus squash and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
Recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses as a driving force of evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Evidence of strain evolution has suggested that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
The bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Heights Coronavirus) detected in tricolor bats in North America has been reported to be closely related to the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has been found to be genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and it has been suspected that the camels are also its intermediate host.
For illustration, current information on the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
An analysis of the evolution of strains provided evidence of human coronavirus transmissions between species throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E between species remains less clear.
Alpha coronaviruses in bats have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is the alpha-coronavirus in the alpaca.
Several evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats directly to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared habitat.
Humans have close contact with the Alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E in bats is multiple and non-pathogenic, while alpaca HCoV-229E causes respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca-associated alpha-coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpaca may have been infected with HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause diseases to humans including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hindra virus.
So it’s no surprise that bats may transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
While bat alpha coronaviruses act as gene pools for HCoV-229E, alpacas and lone camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just like in Mers-Cove.
Mers-Cove provides an excellent example of interspecies transmission as it moves from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats has been known since the beginning of its identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus species to exchange genetic pieces within one species and transmit between species.
Bats are characterized by longevity, living in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction, and strong ability to fly, all of which are conditions conducive to making them an ideal “virus distributor”.
On the other hand, Mers-Cove has moved on to the single camel hump for decades.
These camels have adapted so well that they have gone from an intermediate host to a natural and stable warehouse host.
MERS-CoV causes very minor disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its intermittent transmission to humans remains a coincidence and man is a non-transmitting host for Mers-Cove where its transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of Mers-Cove, the role of squash ants, if any, in the transmission of SARS-Cove-2 is different.
In particular, beta-coronaviruses associated with squash ant-eaters make it very sick.
They may be non-transmitting hosts for SARS-CoV-2 beta-coronaviruses, similar to the civet cat in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies will determine many of the possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species from animals to humans by either proving or excluding it.
First, bats may be hosts to a reservoir of a virus associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is mostly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans and bats may share an ecological habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the squash ants can be one of the intermediate amplified hosts of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2-associated virus.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and consuming prey meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is warranted.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 recombination and adaptation may have occurred in a third species with contact with bats and squash ants.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origin is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, on the viral side there are three main factors that are also important in facilitating the infection of coronaviruses to bypass species barriers.
First, it has relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Estimated mutation rates for coronaviruses, compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average turnover rate of <0x7E>10-4 turnovers per year for site 2, depending on the stage of coronavirus adaptation to new hosts.
Coronaviruses include an external corrective ribonuclease enzyme, which deletion results in very high mutability and attenuation or an inability to develop.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue drug remedesefer is known for its ability to suppress the transcription of the coronavirus by inhibiting the exogenous ribonuclease enzyme and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are about a million times higher than those of hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt appropriately to the host.
The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably low when compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It seems that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the Mers-CoV, which has adapted well to the lone camels.
In theory, genetic aberration vaccines and antiviral drugs are unlikely to help fight SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly impairing its effectiveness.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses actively provides additional plasticity in mutant genome modification and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions become favorable.
This is supported by the unique abundant open reading templates and protein encoded functions near the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA transcription through a unique “copy selection” mechanism.
In a host that is like a mixed vessel, sequence switching occurs frequently during RNA transcription of a coronavirus.
High-symmetry full-length ribosomal nucleic acids and secondary genomes may recombine to generate new coronaviruses.
Evidence has been found of the evolution of strains for natural recombination in HCoV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as animal coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV in bats and HKU9 in bats.
Interaction of the virus with the host associated with transmission
In addition to the three aforementioned viral factors, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor in cross-species transmission.
In this regard, we take the recombination of SARS-CoV as a typical example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission incidents.
Based on comparative analysis of SARS-CoV isolated samples in humans and civet cats, SARS-CoV was thought to undergo rapid adaptation in various hosts, particularly through mutations in receptor binding to S protein.
In general, the receptor sphere of the S-receptor of the coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the field of binding of receptors in amino acids 318 to 510 occurs in block S1, which is associated with the ACE2 enzyme as well as auxiliary receptors for virus entry.
The receptor binding field in SARS-CoV is capable of identifying ACE-2 receptors in various animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues that were different from human and civet-insulated viral specimens were observed in the receptor binding field, and 4 of them were found in the receptor binding pattern for interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme receptor 2.
K479N and S487T mutations in the SARS-CoV receptor binding field are found in the civet cat, which could increase the likelihood of a spike protein reaction in the human angiotensin-2 converting enzyme receptor.
In other words, these two types of amino acid substitutes may be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein, which implies that the probability of S protein binding in human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has changed.
Indeed, an ultra-cold electron microscope study suggested there was a 10- to 20-fold higher probability of this association compared to that between the human angiotensin-2-converting enzyme and the S-protein in SARS-CoV.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of auxiliary receptor may be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
It is also interesting that HCoV-NL63 is also associated with the ACE-2 enzyme but in a different part of the protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as the HCoV-229E protein analyzer, and the 9-O-cyalic acid modulated by HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after transitioning between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also controlled by other factors of dependence and host constraints.
The diversity of these host proteins among humans and hosts of natural reservoirs of coronaviruses, such as bats, lone camels, and rodents, may be an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses need to control the host's dependency factors and weaken its constraint factors to carry out successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain detectable and characteristic.
Extensive, unbiased screening of the genome can be used to look at the dependency factors and host limitations of SARS-CoV-2 using cutting-edge CRISPR technology.
The Emergence of Emerging Human Coronaviruses: Back to the Starting Point
The variety of coronaviruses in bats presents ample opportunities for the emergence of emerging human coronaviruses.
Based on this logic, coronaviruses in bats are a genetic complex of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV, two important points in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of emerging protein cryptographic genes involves the ability to modify viral phenotypes to a great extent.
Among SARS-CoV regulating proteins, ORF8 was thought to be important in adapting to humans, with virus-linked SARS-CoV isolated in bats but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
The 29 nucleotide deletion properties of SARS-CoV were found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion has split ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that enhances host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination through strains of alpha and gamma coronaviruses, with a large number of small recombination areas identified in RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, research has shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has seen cases of recombination between different strains, which occurred in the sole camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinations have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses have been synthesized with other animal coronaviruses in their non-constructive genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help with unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which are likely caused by viruses getting rid of selective pressures exerted, such as by the host’s immune system.
The loss of the full-length ORF4 protein in the HCoV-229E phenotype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although healthy ORF4 can be observed in camel and bat viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca-infected alpha-coronavirus shows single nucleotide stitches, leading to a surge in the underlining frame.
Last but not least, the development of new coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their repository hosts.
Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have only been detected when bats are infected with coronaviruses, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It showed that bats adapted appropriately to anatomically and physiologically coronaviruses.
For example, weak activation of the inflammatory-supporting response in bats has effectively reduced the pathogens provoked by coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cell activity was suppressed in bats due to an increased rate of natural killer cell receptor inhibitor NKG2/CD94 and a lower level of expression of major histocompatibility class I molecules.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen compound types (reactive oxygen compound types) resulting from the increased metabolic activity of bats can both inhibit the replication of the coronavirus and influence the correction by the exogenous ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the emergence of highly pathogenic strains of the virus when a new host is infected.
Additional pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may arise by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Accordingly, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the past two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in warehouse hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why asymptomatic virus carriers are seen and the causes of acute cases of human infection.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by an overactive immune response and a cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung injury.
Conversely, in the case of asymptomatic carriers, the immune response separates from the replication of the coronavirus.
A strategy similar to dissociating the immune response may have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, taking interferon type I at least in the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans can be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory particle cryopyrin NLRP3 in bats is weak.
With this mental logic, inhibition of the inflammatory particle cryopyrine NLRP3 with the MCC950 inhibitor is beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it was discovered that beta coronavirus in bats shares SARS-CoV 95% nucleotide homogenization, there was also a bat coronavirus that shares 96% of nucleotide homogenization with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals on the market were found to harbor SARS-CoV-like viruses, they did not detect SARS-CoV-2 intermediate direct hosts.
Beta-coronaviruses have been detected in squash ants that are very homogeneous with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that squash ants may be an intermediate host or that beta-coronaviruses in squash ants have contributed to genetic fragmentation leading to the final release of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was man-made either intentionally or accidentally.
Coronaviruses have returned to the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal repositories of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 all originate from bats and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Based on the fact that SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civet cats in the markets, the closure of fresh produce markets and the killing of civet cats were supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
With the same mental logic, squash ants should be eliminated from fresh product markets to prevent the transmission of zoonotic disease, given the discovery of multiple genealogies of beta-coronaviruses in squash ants that are very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans, as well as how it is transmitted, through squash ants and other mammals, its transmission remains a topic that needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, Mers-Cove has been found in camels alone for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for local citizens.
It is widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa region.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, as officials in China’s wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop repeated outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines, as well as other infection control measures.
Because we are unable to completely eradicate these viruses, new genes may emerge and cause outbreaks.
A variety of coronaviruses associated with zoonotic diseases are found in wildlife.
In particular, coronaviruses in bats are highly diverse and have the potential to cause zoonotic diseases.
There are many opportunities for the emergence and re-synthesis of animal disease-related coronaviruses, leading to the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or deadly human coronaviruses in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to minimize unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of human adversity caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The fact is that many viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural repositories until they have an opportunity to spread and multiply.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that obliges them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to gain a better understanding of the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which proves useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and in preventing future occurrences.
Finally, the best way to prevent zoonotic viral diseases is for humans to stay away from the environmental locations of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
The mystery of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains surrounded by many questions that need to be answered.
First, if the bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the squash ants, it is important to know the conditions under which bats and squash ants share the same environmental location.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of disease to humans, then the way in which humans communicate with them should be determined.
Third, if a third species of mammal acts as a true intermediate host, then it should be explained how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and squash ants.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infections should be performed.
Whether the host is a bat, squash ant-eater or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses are expected to be identified and are roughly identical in their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important measures to prevent and control COVID-19 in humans.
The need to update the “suspicious case” and “confirmed case” criteria when diagnosing COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus), which provided our experience and included relevant reference information to combat the pandemic globally.
Although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; and diagnosis and treatment strategies are continually updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and presented the latest diagnostic criteria, “suspicious case” and “confirmed case”, in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (version 7) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus), now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), became known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team drafted a quick guidance and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has received a lot of attention since its publication.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increases based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; diagnoses and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, issued a total of seven versions with some contexts changing substantially.
Zhou and others have now commented on our guidance, making a simple suggestion for monitoring scores based on the clinical trial.
Their efforts have added a new guide to our guidance and have become a valuable reference for the pandemic around the world.
We support their great effort and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (Beta 7) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case requires combining any of the elements of epidemiological history characteristics with two elements of clinical manifestations to reach a comprehensive analysis, or requires verification of three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel to Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities with reported cases of COVID-19, including hospitalization, during the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of communicating with SARS-CoV-2 infections; (with positive DNA test results;) history of communicating with patients with fever or peripheral respiratory symptoms from a city or two other communities.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging characteristics for COVID-19 infection; (3) showing a normal, low, or low total white blood cell count in the early stage of infection.
The diagnosis of a confirmed condition should be based on a positive IG or acute Ig-2 level of any of the elements of evidence of pathogens or serum reactions according to the following: (1) positive real-time BCR test result for SARS-CoV-2; (2) elevated homogenization of the entire viral genome sequence with the characteristics of novel coronaviruses known to be negative Ig-2; (3) positive IgG specific antibody test results and antibody.
We see that the real-time PCR test for respiratory tract DNA or blood samples was added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third edition (22 January 2020).
The detection of pathogens in the blood sample was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (8 February, 2020) editions; the evidence of serum reactions was then added to the seventh edition.
These modifications have built on the ongoing work of researchers to design an ideal DNA detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood samples, increasing the availability of different samples, and supporting the transfer of positive antibody specificity to confirmed case standards.
In addition, there is growing evidence that calls for caution when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and asymptomatic conditions.
Therefore, the content of the information flow chart should be updated for Zhu et al., as they rated the clinically symptom-free person as “low risk”.
A score monitoring system also needs to be validated in practice and additional clinical studies.
Finally, we hope to gain access to more direct evidence and also invite readers to provide us with their comments.
To diagnose “suspicious status” and “confirmed status,” we call for the latest guidance from the home countries of the people to be followed and adhered to.
Our team will also update our timely guidance to provide assistance.
Bangladesh records five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily rate
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
The Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that, as of yesterday, 114 active cases and 33 recovery cases were under house arrest.
17 deaths have been recorded.
The director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, told an online news conference that the deaths involved four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirjadi, there were two cases over the age of 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41 and 50.
She also said two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
An official at a hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saif Rahman, the director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was receiving care at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaid al-Kader, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport will be stopped for longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
The disruption of public transport initially began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
Commodities are still allowed to be transported: medical products, fuel and food.
The first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March, for two people who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
The three had already recovered by 19 March.
SARS-CoV-2 infections exceed 1 million worldwide
Data from Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2, known as SARS-CoV-2, has exceeded one million worldwide.
COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus has caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day Malawi confirmed the first cases of the coronavirus, and the first associated death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea has claimed to be, as of Thursday, one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 1051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 in the 24 hours preceding 10 a.m. CET (0800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing Johns Hopkins University data, reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, announced the extension of the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would continue to be paid salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the cities of Mecca and Medina to be all day long; previously it was from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. only.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australian stores reduce toilet paper purchase limits for every transaction
Australian store chains Wall Worth and Coles on Saturday and Sunday night tightened restrictions on buying toilet paper to cut it down to two Wall Worth and one Cools per transaction at all branches nationwide.
Aldi’s stores also identified one roll on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at payment points in store chains and on their Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have stockpiled it due to concerns about COVID-19 in case people need self-isolation.
Wallworths on Wednesday introduced restrictions on the delivery of toilet paper to homes, making it one roll per order.
The changes came after previous restrictions passed by Wallworths on March 4 and Coles on March 5 allowing the purchase of only four rolls per transaction.
In its March 8 press release, Coles stated that despite the four-roll restrictions, “many stores still sell all they have within one hour of receiving it,” and described the order as “unprecedented,” as well as Aldy’s in a Facebook post on Tuesday as “unexpected.”
Sales increased “significantly” last week, according to a spokesperson for Wallworths.
Costco’s Canberra store last week also determined that the quantity allowed to buy was two rolls.
To alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger rolls from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Wallworths ordered additional inventory, while Aldi made its inventory available for Wednesday’s special offers scheduled early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on the timing of truck delivery are making it harder.
Production costs are expected to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, with few special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi Stores announced that as a result of the early availability of inventory, some stores will not be able to provide a special Wednesday offer.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said in a report for News.com.au that stores fill stores every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large commodity, which reduces the amount of stock in terms of numbers, and when sold in full, leaves large empty spaces on the shelves, reinforcing a sense of inferiority.
Russell Zimmerman, reported by ABC News, said: “The Coles and Wallworths have the view that if too many goods are available on the shelves, and if products such as toilet rolls and sterilizers can be bought and supplied in bulk, that may reduce panic.”
Who Gives a Crap, a company that produces recycled toilet paper, reported on Wednesday that it was running out of stock.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet wipes, and Solaris Bieber, which produces Sorpent wipes, have confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue providing their products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, noted that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday’s edition of NT News, a daily publication in Darwin, included an eight-page ad fold made so it could be cut and used as toilet paper.
Shops initially hesitated about restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, with stores saying they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including gags, sterilizers, dried goods, handwashing and flour.
Along the same lines, outside Australia, it was noted on Sunday evening that a British online store called Okadoo is limiting the purchases of toilet paper Andres to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 – a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) – has reached pandemic level.
Although the word “pandemic” only refers to the extent of the disease, not the seriousness of specific cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the need to push governments to take measures:
“All countries can still change the course of this epidemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “If countries detect, screen, treat, isolate, track and mobilize people for confrontation.
“We are all very concerned about the alarming levels of prevalence and risk, as well as alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated, “No other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset of the outbreak to the ongoing global spread, other than influenza.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view: “We have never been exposed to a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
“We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the World Health Organization’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “The bottom line is that things are going to get worse.”
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2.
The outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency of concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have recovered.
China’s mortality rate was estimated at 4%, while globally it ranged from 13.04% in Algeria to 08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is supportive and symptomatic treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining interpersonal spacing, monitoring, and self-isolation of suspected infections.
Authorities around the world are responding to this threat by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global social and economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by purchasing panic.
Schools and universities have closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world’s students.
False information about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent, and other areas where there have been significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel rates and heavy industry closures, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported a range of cases of pneumonia for an unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and investigations began in early January 2020.
Cases are mostly related to the Wuhan Seafood Wholesale Market, so the virus is believed to be of animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to coronaviruses in bats, coronaviruses in squamous ant-eaters, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person with symptoms had been contacted with a group of this person on 1 December 2019.
Of the group of early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report published by the South China Morning Newspaper indicated that a case dated November 17, 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei Province, may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although new cases reported in China have declined, they have risen abruptly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China surpassing the number of new cases for the first time.
There may be a significant underreporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with adults aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Valance, estimated that 60% of Britons needed to be infected before effective herd immunity could be performed.
Cases indicate the number of people who have been screened for COVID-19 and confirmed according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test only for mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China, as of January 23, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection for 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of cases in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases recorded.
Initial estimates of the primary reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who don’t recover, the period from worsening symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, COVID-19 has caused about 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China as of 5 February were concentrated in people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of COVID-19 deaths generally refer to those who have been confirmed to have been infected with COVID according to official protocols.
The real number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without testing – for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of registered COVID-19 deaths by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States acknowledged that "we know that [the number of deaths reported] reflects an underestimation of reality", a statement supported by narrative reports indicating inaccuracy in the United States. Such underestimations occur in pandemics; such as the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of January 9, 2009.
The first death outside mainland China was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty states and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options and time taken since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health. The death to injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given time period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death to injury ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of deaths from infections declined from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures refer to case mortality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of infected people who died from the disease, and infection mortality rate (EFR) which reflects the percentage of infected people who died from the disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame and track a specific population, from the infection to the fate of the condition.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for certain population groups.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates the infection mortality rate for the pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1 percent and 0.39%.
The higher estimate for this range corresponds to the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the effect of the test on estimates of case mortality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stresses the possibility of controlling the pandemic.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Massage Bonnie of Pennsylvania State University stated that: “Outbreaks of infectious diseases that are left uncontrolled usually peak and then begin to decline when the disease finds no available hosts.
“But it’s almost impossible to make any logical predictions right now about the timing of that.”
Zhong Nanshan, China's top medical adviser, said it could be "finished by June" if all countries could be motivated to follow the World Health Organization's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 "will be widespread perhaps for a year or two".
According to a study conducted by Imperial College London under the supervision of scientist Neil Ferguson, we will need to rely on physical spacing and other measures “until a vaccine becomes available (perhaps after 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely — because it’s easily transmissible — and it could “turn into a seasonal disease — so it’s coming back every year.”
The ferocity of return will depend on collective immunity and the extent of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecified and may not show symptoms in those affected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, breathing sputum (phlegm), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or cyanosis. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirms that approximately one in six people has difficulty breathing and severely suffers from the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States limited emergency symptoms to difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden discomfort, difficulty waking up, and bluish face or lips. Immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear. An exacerbation of the disease's progression may lead to acute pneumonia, severe shortness of breath syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock.
Some patients, who do not have clinical symptoms but whose results confirm their infection, may not show symptoms, so specialists have advised that contacted people should be closely monitored for confirmed cases and examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; often five days. As an example of confusion, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who initially lost their sense of smell was 30% and later dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still under investigation.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during mixing or through splashing when coughing, sneezing or talking at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without covering the mouth may result in a spray that spreads from 4.5 meters (15 ft) to 8.2 meters (27 ft).
Some argue that the virus may also be transmitted by a spray trapped in the air for a long time, which may be produced while speaking. It may also produce a respiratory spray during the exhalation process, including when speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of nearby people or be inhaled into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause respiratory secretions to be released in the form of a spray and then spread through the air.
It may also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading from feces to the mouth, the risk is thought to be limited.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from feces to the mouth. The virus is most contagious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People have been confirmed to have the disease up to three days before symptoms appear, indicating the possibility of transmission before severe symptoms appear.
There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that despite some ambiguity about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three more people in general. The virus remains on the surface from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as is the case with contact with other surfaces that an infected person may have touched.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, first isolated from three people who were in contact with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares all its properties with the coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, where its protective membrane dissolves. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to have animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus genetically meets the genus of the beta-coronavirus, and falls under the subgenus of the Sarpi-coronavirus ( strain B) in addition to two strains originating from bats.
96% matches across the genome with other bat coronavirus samples (Bat Cove Rat G13)
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between squash-borne viruses and human-borne viruses.
Comparison of the entire genome so far has led to the discovery of a maximum of 92 percent sharing of genetic material between the squamous ant coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that squamous ant is the intermediate host of the virus.
The virus can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately made by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of infected secretions or computerized tomography (CT).
A Wuhan study comparing polymerase chain interactions and computed tomography showed that computerized tomography is more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, though less accurate, with many of its imaging characteristics interfering with cases of pneumonia and other pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not to use computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or to consider it a preliminary screening to diagnose the disease.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time on January 17.
The test uses a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on samples of the respiratory tract or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally performed with a nasopharyngeal swab, and a swab of the throat can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies develop seroassays that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them has been sufficiently accurate to be widely used.
A serum test developed by Selex has been certified for emergency use in the United States only in approved laboratories.
Radiation imaging and computerized tomography (CT) characteristics of people with symptoms of the disease include asymmetric peripheral opacity such as frosted glass fog and confused crystalline leakage.
The Italian Radiation Society compiles an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Radiography without a polymerase chain reaction is a limited-resolution procedure for the detection of COVID-19 due to its overlap with other diseases such as adenovirus infection.
A large study in China compared the results of chest computed tomography and serial polymerase reaction and proved that although imaging is less accurate in terms of proving an infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it is a screening tool in endemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect the characteristics of virus imaging in both radiological imaging and computerized tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and then throwing it straight into the trash.
Those already infected are advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Physical spacing procedures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak or advised against travel.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading to society as a whole in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they have been infected. Health care providers who care for a person who is likely to be infected are advised to use reasonable measures, mixing precautions and eye protection. Tracking contacts of infected people is an effective way for health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent outbreaks.
The use of mobile location data by governments for the purpose of tracking has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement demanding that such surveillance be restricted.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups have worked on privacy-sensitive solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach someone who has proven to be infected with COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, nasal rinsing and gargling with mouthwash is not a viable solution.
There is still no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on a vaccine.
It is advisable to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirt appears on their hands, before eating, and after emptying the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because household soap kills the virus outside the body; it destroys its protective membrane.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also recommended using a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with various disinfectants (within one minute of applying the disinfectant to the surface of stainless steel), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodopovidone 0.2–7.5%.
Other disinfectants, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that when a person is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 in a facility such as an office or care center, all places such as offices, bathrooms, shared spaces and shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations have advised people to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing, either bending the elbow in front of the mouth and nose or using a paper napkin and immediately discarding any napkins.
People who are likely to be infected are recommended to use medical masks, as wearing the mask reduces the size of the respiratory spray and the distance it travels when scattered by talking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virus scientist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce [people's] desire to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if their hands are not properly cleaned." People who care for people who are likely to get sick are recommended to use masks.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthy people only wear masks if they are at high risk, such as those caring for COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage ordinary people to wear face masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a non-medical cloth face mask. China specifically recommends healthy people to use disposable medical masks, especially if people are in direct contact (at a distance of 1 m (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out to public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government made it mandatory for anyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has asked passengers of trains and intercity buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made it necessary to wear a face mask when going out, while also recommending the manufacture of face masks at home for those who can’t afford face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimizing the mixing of individuals.
Roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging touchless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments currently impose or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no COVID-19 prevalence was detected in the region) to 50 people, and 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension, and weakened immune systems face an increased risk of serious diseases and complications. The CDC has advised them to stay home as much as possible in areas of intercommunity outbreaks.
The use of the term "social distancing" has suggested that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during a pandemic.
This includes recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with who is not HIV-positive or has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people with COVID-19 and those suspected of having it.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have self-quarantined or recommended self-quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued for those in the most vulnerable groups.
Those who have treated a person with COVID-19 and have recently travelled to a country or region where the infection is widely spread are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Outbreak control strategies are containment or curbing and limiting spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of an outbreak and is aimed at tracking and isolating infected people as well as introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Curbing the epidemic requires more stringent measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline number of reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of infectious disease outbreaks attempts to reduce the peak of the epidemic, in what is known as a flattening of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health service stress and provides more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may address outbreaks include whole personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-quarantine; community actions aimed at physical distancing such as school closures and cancellation of major gathering events; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. As soon as stricter measures were taken to contain the outbreak, the disease was contained in China.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screenings and local quarantines, and issued alerts about the movements of the injured.
Singapore provided financial support to the injured who isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and criminalized the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing the spread of the epidemic rather than stopping it) and curbing (reversing the growth of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and strain health systems.
Suppression may be preferable but should be maintained as long as the virus spreads to humans (or until the vaccine becomes available, if this happens first), as transmission, on the other hand, bounces back quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications and drinking fluids and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may aggravate the results.
Many compounds that have been previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are screened for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some "traditional and home therapies" can provide relief for symptoms caused by SARS-Covid-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting health care centers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as key measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and WHO’s European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating people with COVID-19, increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are multiple theories about where the first case originated (so-called patient zero).
The first known case of coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus came from one of these species; in other words, it has animal origin. A group with pneumonia for an unknown reason was observed on December 26 and dealt with by Dr. Zhang Zhijiang at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, which reported the Center for Disease Control.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “corona-like SARS” virus.
Police alerted eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumours, and another doctor, Ai Wen, was scolded by her superiors to trigger the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
Sufficient cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to Wuhan health authorities prompting them to begin investigations in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by commuters during the Chinese New Year and because Wuhan is a transportation hub and the junction point of major railway lines.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later released shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States, China and Italy surpassed the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 people dying and more than 36,000 recovering.
Nearly 200 countries and territories have registered at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or closures) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, had undergone some form of closure in the United States, more than 50 million people had been closed in the Philippines, and about 59 million people in South Africa, 1.3 billion had been closed.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were subjected to one form of closure, a figure that rose to 2.6 billion two days later—about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates from December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jishian noticed a series of cases of pneumonia caused by an unknown cause on December 26, and her hospital reported it to the Center for Disease Control in Jianghan, Wuhan, on December 27.
A preliminary genetic test of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31.
WHO was informed on the same day.
In the presence of these notices, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police about “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of person-to-person transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping later described as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the "greatest quarantine in human history", a health cordon was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
Use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in several places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterwards, Lishenshan Hospital, to deal with additional patients.
In addition to newly established hospitals, China has also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into makeshift hospitals. On 26 January, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including providing health announcements to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Restrictions were imposed on travel inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums were temporarily closed across China.
Public movement has been tightened in several cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been subjected to some form of exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities have taken drastic measures to prevent the virus from being "bringed" to them from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all returnees from other countries. On March 23, one case was transferred locally to mainland China over the past five days, by a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stated that the spread of locally transmitted infections has decreased and the outbreak has been controlled in China.
Travel restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the closure was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the suspension of entry for visa or residence permit holders from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged companies and factories to resume work on March 30, and offered a monetary stimulus package for companies. The State Council declared a three-minute day of mourning starting at 10:00 a.m. on April 4, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government demanded that families show their respect online due to the physical spacing to avoid a new COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 transmission from China to South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
Shincheonji followers visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 people, or about 13% of 9,336 church adherents, reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest levels of preparedness on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were placed under quarantine after tests confirmed three soldiers were infected with the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected, and so changed. South Korea implemented a program considered the largest and best-regulated in the world to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected, track their contacts and place them under quarantine.
Screening methods included mandatory personal reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via the mobile app, testing people in their cars with test results available the next day, and increasing testing capabilities to 20,000 people per day.
The South Korean program represents a success in controlling the outbreak despite the quarantine not being applied to entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either demanding Moon’s removal, claiming the government mishandled the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total cases in a single day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that as of April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed under quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries to help test the virus.
Iran reported its first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 19 in Qom, with two people dying later in the day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, institutes of higher education, and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on February 26, 2020 that there is no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals will be isolated.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities continued ahead of the Persian New Year.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China.
Amid allegations of Iran’s cover-up over the outbreak, more than a dozen countries have tracked back cases from Iran as of February 28, suggesting the extent of the outbreak could exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
Iran’s parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly infected with the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release eligible prisoners.
There is a high risk of the virus spreading in enclosed spaces such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in one day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 Iranian politicians and current and former government officials had died of the disease by March 17.
By March 23, Iran was reporting 50 new cases per hour, and one death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran could be up to five times what was reported.
It is also believed that U.S. sanctions on Iran may affect the financial capacity of the country to respond to the virus outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for easing economic sanctions on the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed in Italy on January 31, when SARS-CoV-2 tests for Chinese tourists in Rome were positive.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated set of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “It will not be allowed to enter or leave the outbreak areas.
Work activities and sporting events in those areas have already been suspended." On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country with deaths in Italy reaching 100 cases.
All major sporting events, including soccer league matches, were scheduled to take place behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after 3,405 deaths were reported due to the pandemic.
On 22 March, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recovered in Italy, most of them in the Lombardy region.
A combination of a large number of older people and the inability to test all those living with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to the high mortality rate, CNN said.
The UK's response to the virus first emerged as the most lax among the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and severity in responding to concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising to avoid unnecessary travel or social contacts, proposing that people work from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all recreational facilities such as bars and gyms as soon as possible, promising to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a maximum of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to reduce unemployment at the time of the crisis. On 23 March, the prime minister announced stricter social distancing measures, as gatherings of more than two people were banned and maximum travel and outdoor activity were restricted.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were implemented by the police through the issuance of fines and the dispersal of rallies.
Most companies have been ordered to close, with the exception of “necessary” business ventures, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and garages.
On January 20, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the northwestern Pacific state of Washington for a man returning from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was set up on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency, imposing restrictions on the entry of travellers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control—the leading U.S. government public health institute—announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite doing so, the United States slowed down the start of the test, obscuring the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test spoiled a flawed test kit produced by the federal government in February, the federal government’s lack of approval of non-governmental test kits (by academia, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (a doctor’s order was required thereafter).
By February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, The Associated Press reported: "Many people who have experienced symptoms and have a doctor's order waited hours or days for testing." After reporting the first death in the United States in Washington state on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, a measure that was soon followed by other states.
Schools in Seattle cancelled classes on March 3, and by mid-March, schools across the country were closed. On March 6, 2020, the United States was informed of the projections regarding the impact of the novel coronavirus on the country by epidemiologists at Imperial College London.

On 13 March, he declared a national emergency, which allowed federal funds to be used to respond to the crisis.
As of March 15, many companies have closed or reduced their working hours across the United States in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On 23 March, 10,700 coronavirus cases were reported in New York City, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said that social distancing appeared to be a success, with estimates showing a slowdown in case doubling from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people died from the virus. On March 26, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, 400,335 cases have been confirmed in the United States, and 12,841 people have died.
According to media reports on March 30, US President Trump has decided to extend the social distancing directive until April 30.
On the same day, the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship with about 1,000 beds, docked in New York.
On April 3, the United States recorded 884 deaths due to the coronavirus in 24 hours.
In New York State the number of cases exceeded 100,000 people on April 3. The White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and controlling news circulation by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with Vice President Mike Pence's office.
The Trump administration’s crisis has not been universally applauded as it has created a broad polarization between parties.
Some U.S. officials and commentators have criticized the U.S. reliance on importing essential items, including essential medical supplies, from China.
The analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict prevalence patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei had the largest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne have also been reported as popular destinations for travelers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least capable of more than 20 popular destinations in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered more capable. Australia released its COVID-19 emergency response plan on 7 February.
Not much has yet been discovered about COVID-19, and Australia will emphasize border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.
As public transport has been affected by effective quarantine in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their nationals and diplomatic staff from the region, primarily through charter flights from their home countries, with Chinese authorities providing permits.

On 11 February, another aircraft carrying 185 Canadians from Wuhan landed at the Trenton Canadian Forces base.
Australian authorities evacuated 277 citizens on 3 and 4 February to the Christmas Island Detention Center, which was reused as a quarantine facility, where they stayed for 14 days.
A New Zealand evacuation flight arrived in Auckland on February 5, and its passengers (including people from Australia and the Pacific) were isolated at a naval base in Wanjabarawa, north of Auckland.
On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate Americans who were on board cruise ship Diamond Princess.
On 21 February, a plane landed at Trenton, Ontario, carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March a plane from South African Airlines chartered by the South African government returned 112 South African citizens.
A pre-departure medical examination was conducted, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left to mitigate the risk.
South Africans whose test results were only negative were returned.
The test results showed that South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission who, as a precautionary measure, remained under surveillance and quarantined at Ranch Resort for 14 days, were uninfected.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On 5 February, the Chinese Foreign Ministry reported that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students at U.S. universities joined forces to send aid to HIV-infected areas in China, and a joint group in the greater Chicago area reportedly managed to send 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei County on January 30. Humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, in coordination with FedEx, sent 200,000 face masks with other personal protective equipment, including gloves and clothing for hospital staff, by June 30, to a hospital, via an emergency air bridge.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a donation of $100 million to the World Health Organization to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts, as well as to protect “vulnerable populations in Africa and South Asia.”
The Chinese government donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on February 6, after Senator Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it would send $2.26 million in aid to China.
Japan donated 1 million face masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia sent more than 13 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan, Malaysia announced a donation of 18 million medical gloves to China, Germany delivered several medical supplies including 10,000 protective suits, and the United States donated $17.8 million of medical supplies to affected countries.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma has sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where they have been distributed by the African Union.
Subsequently, 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and five respirators were sent to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 test kits made in China with only 30% accuracy, while the Netherlands returned 600,000 face masks made in China that were defective.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable face masks that were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
Parts of Latin America and Africa, on the other hand, welcomed Chinese aid well received. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of blackouts that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government provided “regular updates to avoid panic before the Lunar New Year holiday.”
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to implement the transportation ban in Wuhan, the representative of the World Health Organization Godin Gallia noted that while this was "certainly not a recommendation made by the World Health Organization", it was "a very important indicator of commitment to contain the epidemic where it is highly concentrated", and described it as an "unprecedented concern in the history of public health".
The WHO Director-General said the outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern due to “the risk of global spread, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that do not have strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the World Health Organization does not recommend limiting trade and mobility."
On 5 February, the World Health Organization appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic funds set up in low-income countries, noting the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have systems to detect people living with the virus, even if it emerges.”
Tedros also made statements stating that “our strength is measured by the strength of the weakest of us” and urging the international community to “invest today or pay a big price later.” On February 11, the World Health Organization, at a press conference, called the disease COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to offer “the potential of the entire UN system to respond.”
As a result, a UN Crisis Management Team has been set up, allowing the entire UN response to be coordinated, and WHO will allow it to “focus on the health response while drawing on the expertise of other agencies to see the broader social, economic, and developmental impacts of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was prepared to provide international experts and experts from WHO on the ground in China to help with local management and assess "the severity of the disease and its transmissibility" by hosting workshops and meetings with major national institutions, and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and city level, including urban and rural, of the potential virus".
In response to the outbreak in Iran, the World Health Organization (WHO) sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the global coronavirus threat would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Health Emergency Program, said: “This is a real test for every government on earth: so we need to be prepared.
This virus may be on its way and you should prepare for it,” he said, urging the right response measures that can help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan also stated that current data does not justify public health officials declaring the disease a global pandemic, saying that such an announcement would mean "we basically accept that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
WHO is “deeply concerned about alarming levels of prevalence and severity, and alarming levels of inaction,” the Director-General said. WHO has faced severe criticism for what is seen as inadequate response to the pandemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency, and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
Violent reactions included a petition by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts affirmed respect for everyone’s rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and the government bears this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minorities, the elderly, the internally displaced, the homeless, those living in extremely poor conditions, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
Intergovernmental organizations address the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to address the effects of closures and travel restrictions, the Digital Hub includes a state policy tracking tool, designed to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Gove and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s son, Edward Bolsonaro, for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China’s Hubei Province.
A number of CPC directors have been fired at a multi-sectoral level for dealing with quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Communist Party of China (CPC) Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public discontent over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, have rejected a previous admission that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories claimed by the United States or Italy regarding COVID-19.
The Donald Trump administration called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying China "imposed a news blackout that exacerbated the virus, which has now become a global pandemic", which some critics have criticized as racist and "distracts [attention] from his administration's failure to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government telegram reviewing the communications blueprint with clear sources at the National Security Council, stating strategically that "it's all about China.
We were asked to seek and disseminate these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. “News sources such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push for global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of a “geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through circumvention and generosity policies.”
Borrell also said, “China is strongly pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
U.S. sanctions banned Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid that was destined for other countries to their own countries.
Mask-related disputes have been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Mauritsu Masari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “It is only China that has responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin equipped the Russian military to send military paramedics, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an unnamed “high-ranking political source” as saying that 80 percent of Russia’s aid was “unhelpful or unhelpful to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of launching a striking “geographical and diplomatic” attack.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when providing assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are activated again, they will also be able to repay the favor if necessary."
NATO’s planned “2020 gun exercise” will take place in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO’s largest small-scale war exercise since the end of the Cold War.
“Under the current public health crisis, training puts not only the lives of troops from the United States and many of the participating European countries at risk but also the populations of the countries in which it will take place,” the Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the training of the 2020 defenders, saying: “The training puts not only the lives of troops from the United States and many European countries involved at risk but also the populations of the countries in which it will take place.”
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020 asking for help, saying that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, comprehensive child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "mysterious and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined at designated government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for Moon’s impeachment for claiming that the government mishandled the outbreak or praised its response. The pandemic has allowed states to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to tighten their control over power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government’s handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak, which has led to many supply shortages, has been blamed for the increasing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic buying, and disruption to the operation of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier shutdowns.
Many areas also saw panic buying, which left shelves free of essential groceries such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing shortages of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand caused prices to rise by up to twenty times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed by four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the World Health Organization warning that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for Diago shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the ensuing high demand for food products, both regions survived severe food shortages.
Actions taken by China and Italy to combat the storage and illicit trafficking of vital products have succeeded in averting the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy's large agricultural output has not seen a significant decline, but prices may rise according to industry representatives' expectations.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for residents.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to hold stocks for such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: according to a media report on March 16, China’s economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 by measures taken by the government to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and industrial center, it has been noted that the outbreak of the virus poses a significant destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demaris of the Economic Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until they showed a clearer picture of the possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic repercussions of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the global supply chain has been affected by more than $300 billion, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly experienced a “disequilibrium” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on Feb. 24 due to a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including Nasdaq-100, S<0x26>P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded their biggest drop since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1,191 points, its biggest one-day drop since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week down more than 10 percent.
On February 28, Scoop Ratings confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained negative expectations.
Stocks fell again due to concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest drop being on March 16.
Many believe that a recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and countries in a timely manner.
Central banks are responding faster than they were in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and warning governments against traveling around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern, and Kants, while the British regional airline, Flyby, collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry was at an unprecedented level.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the travel season of the Spring Festival known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of events with large crowds, including New Year’s celebrations, with private companies also closing their stores independently and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Several Lunar New Year events and attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including Beijing’s Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, and in municipalities and districts in China, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong has raised its response to infectious diseases to the highest level, declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year's celebrations. The global retail sector has been affected by reduced store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a decline of between 50 and 60%.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, installing thermal scanners to check shoppers’ temperatures, and cancelling events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the stagnation caused by the pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would otherwise suffer without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the nearly 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were trapped in their homes in the interior provinces, or in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The shutdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily wages) unemployed. A mid-March 2020 survey by the Angus Reed Institute found that nearly 90 percent of Canadian households had lost jobs.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers in government-backed short-term work plans known as Kurzbeet.
France and Britain adopted a German short-term work compensation scheme.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals—workers and independents—globally.
Arts and culture sector institutions have sought to support their mission (often funded by the government) to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, keep their employees and the public safe, and support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions had been closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerated ramifications of the disease include the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a pause. The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian Fasting season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home instead of attending church services on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming or television, while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rome closing its churches and ecclesiastical chapel, and the evacuation of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also abolished limited public services and assemblies in churches, mosques, synagogues, synagogues, and the Gordowara.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced Friday prayers were cancelled in areas affected by the outbreak and afterwards the shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the biggest imbalance in the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Europa League, the 2019–20 NHL season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to start at the end of July, and the IOC announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled beyond 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021". Gambling clubs and other venues around the world were closed and live gambling tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This led many gamblers to move on to play online, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling concert tours.
Many large theatres such as those on Broadway have suspended all shows as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue to produce and share work online as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live-streaming concerts or creating online “celebrations” for artists to perform, distribute and publish their work.
Many Internet memes about the coronavirus have spread on the Internet as much has turned to humor and entertainment in the shadows of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, severe bias, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries, have been observed.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports released in February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by different groups around the world toward Chinese that they deserved the virus or were receiving what is alleged to be justified punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their territorial origin.
There has been support for Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak spreads into new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may be exposed to skepticism and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions for pressure to prevent Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag ChineseDontComeToJapan <0x23>Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuses, as well as abuses.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus,” a term critics have deemed racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine have attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, studying in major Indian cities have been harassed by the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the BJP unit in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God avenged them."
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the remarks, calling them “wrong.” In China, the pandemic led to an increase in xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, where foreigners were described as “foreign garbage” and targeted “to get rid of them.”
Many newspapers have removed subscription-paid pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers on outbreaks available for open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their results on preprint servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for COVID-19 and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes ways to detect the presence of the virus as it recognizes antibodies that are produced in response to infection.
RT-BCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where it detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and designed only to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (immunology) is used for the diagnosis and monitoring of populations.
Antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have not.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of mass immunity among the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population.
As of March 23, no country had screened more than 3% of its population, and there is a significant variation in the number of tests performed by different countries.
This variance is also likely to have a significant impact on reported case mortality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
With instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained in various ways, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-BCR, which is performed with throat swabs, is not relied upon until the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people who are screened in the second week, you can alternatively take a sample of the deep airways by suction catheter or using cough material (phlegm).
One of the early BCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the reverse transcription instantaneous chain polymerase reaction (RTT-BCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech also invented a SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) detection kit suitable for safe clinical use and based on the BCR on January 28, 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain approval for emergency use from the National Administration of Medical Products of China for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, Cora-CoV-CoV-based diagnostic panel is distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
One of the three genetic tests in the older versions of the test kits resulted in inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and one test stage was delayed over the others at CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully tested throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components did not gain trust until February 28, 2020, and until then, state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began conducting tests in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-BCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has made COVID-19 testing available nationwide as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; the sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the State Center for Research in Virology and Biotechnology Victor invented and produced the COVID-19 test.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Healthcare Surveillance Service recorded the test. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on large numbers, allowing one machine to perform approximately 24 hours of 4,128 tests.
On 19 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration granted the EUA to Abbott Laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Holodeck, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, SEVID obtained a similar emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in favor of a test that would take about 45 minutes.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a test that uses isothermic DNA amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States and Abbott expects to increase manufacturing to perform 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is also developing a test that uses a monoclonal antibody that is specifically linked to the nuclear capsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, in the hope that it will be able to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that “chest radiography has little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results may be apparent even before symptoms appear.”
The usual characteristics seen in CT scans include double-sided, polylobular glazed obfuscations with asymmetrical peripheral and posterior distribution.
Subpleural spread develops and irregular patches appear and intensify as the disease progresses.
A Wuhan study comparing BCR and CT scans in relation to the origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT scans are more sensitive than CT scans, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with cases of pneumonia and other stages of disease.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using computed tomography to detect COVID-19 or consider it a preliminary screening to diagnose the disease." In March 2020, the CDC recommends using BCR for preliminary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect individuals within 7 days or after symptoms appear, to determine immune capacity, and in case of population monitoring. It can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by clinical care point test (PCT).
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the rate of production of each system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although successive samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For a clinical point-of-care test, a single blood sample is usually drawn through a skin puncture.
Unlike the BCR methods, the extraction step does not need to be performed prior to screening. On 26 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified 29 entities that had notified the agency according to the requirements and could distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one test under the Emergency Use Authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European accreditations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test completes several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is therefore much faster than a conventional BCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In April, the UK discovered that the antibody test kits it bought were not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has developed a plan under which patients suspected of being infected can stay at home, "Emergency Department gives patients a sample tube", spit in the tube, and return it to get the test result shortly after. The NHS has announced that it is testing a plan to leave the suspected cases at home, thus excluding the risk of infection from patients coming to the hospital.
In-car testing centres have enabled South Korea to perform one of the world’s fastest and most comprehensive tests. In Germany, on 2 March, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians stated that it was able to perform about 12,000 tests per day for outpatients and 10,700 people were tested last week.
The costs are borne by health insurance if a doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, in-car tests were made available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive case results were announced.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that from February 1st, 2020, at least 483,295 samples had been tested until the end of the 12th, 2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rimbam Hospital developed a method for testing samples taken from 64 patients.
With Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, overseeing the construction work and taking 5 days to complete, modeling operations showed that cases in Hubei would have risen by 47% and the associated quarantine costs would have doubled if that testing capability had not been completed.
Wuhan Laboratory immediately followed the establishment of Huo-Yan Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and in a total of 12 cities across China.
By March 4, 2020, total daily productivity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays has released open source and multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 with just 93 screenings. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for automated fluid processors.
In March, a shortage and insufficient reagents caused a stalemate when a large number of tests were conducted in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has prompted some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols that include heating samples at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to edit the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE is the world’s leading country in terms of the proportion of coronavirus testing for its population, and is on track to raise the standard of testing to reach most of the population.
This was through a combination of activating in-vehicle testing capability, and purchasing a population-friendly ultra-productive lab from Group 42 and BGI (depending on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
The lab, set up in 14 days, allows tens of thousands of RT-BCR tests per day and is the world’s first laboratory of this size to operate outside of China.
Different methods of testing targeting different parts of the genetic features of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted a German plan to make kits for low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own kits.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, delaying available tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. faced problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these two countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and follow the test recommendations made by health experts.
Experts say the abundance of tests in South Korea has helped curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean government has significantly enhanced the testing capacity of private sector laboratories over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for intensified testing programs as the optimal solution to limit the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to accumulate in private U.S. laboratories, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents has been limited.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, test kits created by CDC found “defects”; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing in particular. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Limited, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or not to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry stated that it would back off the purchase of kits that gave incorrect results, and replace them with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> proposed throwing it into the Danube. Professor Aceh Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and had "prevented their use". The UK also purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 declared them unusable.
Tests, followed by quarantine and tracking of contacts with SARS-CoV-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vu, which saw its first COVID-19 death in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 people twice, taking about 10 days at a time.
Nearly half of the people tested positive showed no symptoms, and all cases detected were isolated.
As a result of the ban on movement between towns, the new infections have been completely eliminated.
Singapore’s 2020 coronavirus pandemic has seen a significant drop in prevalence compared to other developed countries, but without stringent restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail facilities through strict contact tracing and restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine.
Several events were cancelled, and Singapore already began urging residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 on schedule after the holidays.
Several other countries have also taken control of the pandemic by strictly tracking contacts and imposing restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closures, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries with more tests compared to deaths have much lower case mortality rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct tests or have local laboratories with limited experience of COVID-19 send the first five positive and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 laboratories accredited by WHO to confirm the test.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following graph, the “Positive % of tests” column is influenced by the country’s testing policy.
A country that only tests for people who are hospitalized will have a % higher positive test score than the country that tests for all its residents, whether they have symptoms or not, given the equality of other factors.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Constant hand washing with soap at certain "necessary times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal route.
People can also develop respiratory diseases such as the flu or a cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
These include the five necessary moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s back or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, before preparing food or after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before preparing food, during, and after.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing a diaper for a child or cleaning it after using it for the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, their feed, or their excrement.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medications or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to disinfect the hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, preventing infectious diseases that cause diarrhea, and reducing respiratory infections.
Reducing infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices may lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing minor behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea bouts by nearly a third, similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only effective and low-cost way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARRI) when applying spontaneous behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main acute respiratory infections, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, killing about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause about 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an inherent habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against herpes that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Hand washing has a minor harmful effect: frequent hand washing can damage the skin due to dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of exfoliation and itching known as hand eczema or hand skin inflammation, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Too much hand washing is also often seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five necessary moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral anal route: after using the bathroom (urination, defecation), after cleaning the back of the baby (change of diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating food, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
The correct hand washing method should be practiced in other cases in order to prevent the transmission of the disease, such as before or after treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal excrement, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is decreasing.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate estimated at 97 percent, the United States is closer to the center at 77 percent, and in China the lowest at 23 percent. Many behavior-change methodologies are now available in countries to increase the use of hand washing with soap at times necessary.
The “Basic Health Care Program” implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of widespread action to promote children’s health and education.
Treatment of worms twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily fluoride brushing, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water promotes the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to atomization, increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective disinfectant for the skin because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not easily decompose into water.
However, the flow of an appropriate amount of water helps to disinfect.
Due to its reusable nature, solid soaps may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
Few studies that have observed bacterial transmission from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transmission is unlikely because bacteria are washed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still states that “liquid soap is preferred to be used from devices that operate without touching to pump soap.”
Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted to health-conscious consumers.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or sterilizers is chosen to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of strains of organisms.
So, if antibacterial soap does not affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it is marketed.
In addition to a surfactant and skin protection agent, advanced formulations may contain bacterial acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as an acid regulator and normal antimicrobial benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers that contain as effective as aloe vera (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
Hot water suitable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural oils that retain dust and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a substance that is not water-based for cleaning hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-aqueous hand detergents that are sterilized by rubbing (also known as alcohol-synthetic hand rinses, disinfecting hand rinses or hand sterilizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol compound with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in a gel, a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the effect of alcohol-induced dehydration.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol are effectively bactericidal.
Alcohol sterilizers by rubbing eliminate bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (Golden Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin and vancomicin-resistant enterococci), tuberculosis, and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory synthetic virus, nasal virus, liver, hypox, influenza, etc.).
Alcohol sterilizers containing 70% alcohol by rubbing eliminate 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria on hands 1 minute after application. Some antiviral sterilizers are more effective against hands.
Alcoholic hand sterilizers are almost completely ineffective against noroviruses (or noroviruses), which is the most common cause of infection-induced gastroenteritis. Enough hand disinfectant or alcohol rub must be used to completely wet or cover both hands.
Rub the front and back of the hands and between all fingers and limbs for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
Fingertips should also be thoroughly washed, rubbing them in both paws. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with sterile hand rubbing, especially when the hands are clearly dirty.
The increasing use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and rapid activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcoholic hand sanitizers can dry the skin unless emollients, skin moisturizers, or both are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin, other emollients, or both to the formula.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol hand sanitizers containing emollients cause less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives found in alcoholic handwashing materials rarely occur.
Reduced susceptibility to irritating contact dermatitis has become an attraction compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite the effectiveness of detergents that are not water-based, they do not cleanse hands of organic matter, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sterilizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends largely on the ingredients and composition, and historically its effect has been significantly lower than that of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and persistent antimicrobial effect after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to gradual adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ashes or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but they may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dirt or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, like soap, is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The World Health Organization has recommended using ash or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
The correct hand washing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing sinks may be contaminated, and at the same time the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.
Make foam on the hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer periods removes more germs.
Rinse well under running water.
Rinse your hands inside the tub may cause them to re-contaminate.
Dry with a clean towel or leave it to dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easily polluted again. The most commonly overlooked parts are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail paint may contain microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands, and dry skin can damage it, which may increase the risk of transmission.
Various low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where no tap water, soap or both are available, such as pouring water from a hanging pot or pumping with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as “other tippy tap” and low-cost options.
A tipi tap is a simple technique that uses a jug hanging by a rope, a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene, but there is some controversy about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
An increasing number of research suggests that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Seminar on Paper Towels, to compare the hygiene levels provided by paper towels, hand dryers with warmer air, and newer jet-air hand dryers.
After washing hands and drying them with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the soles of the fingers by 194% and on the palms of the hands by 254%.
Drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the soles of the fingers by 42% and on the palms of the hands by 15%.
After washing and drying the hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the soles of the fingers and on the palms of the hands decreased by up to 76%, and the scientists conducted tests to determine whether there was a risk of transmission to other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which pushes air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and device, and infection may be transmitted to other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt assessed the different methods of drying hands.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after drying the hands:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared with paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sterilization wipes is an alternative when traveling due to the lack of soap and water.
Alcohol hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became compulsory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found lower rates of infection using them.
Medical handwashing should be for at least 15 seconds, using abundant amounts of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed together and the fingers are intertwined.
If there is excrement under the fingernails, a rough brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contaminating your hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a healthcare setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that non-handwashing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to wash their hands routinely before touching patients, transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization has published a paper explaining how to wash and rub hands in the health care sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guidance document submitted by the organization can also be found on its website available for public comment.
Whitby et al. conducted a related review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if required to demonstrate compliance with regulations.
The World Health Organization has five “Handwashing Moments”:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before a sterilization mission,
After caring for patients. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial") adds a pesticide element to the handwashing agent.
This eradication element may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. When rubbing someone’s hands for surgery, a tap is required that can be turned on and off without touching them with your hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine lotion, sterile towels for drying your hands after washing, and a sterile brush for wringing.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
Long scrub time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, water should be prevented from rebounding from forearms to hands.
After washing hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand disinfectant before and after taking care of a sick person.
To control staphylococcal infection in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand-cleaning was found to come from the first 20% of washing, and it gained little additional benefit when the frequency of hand-cleaning increased to over 35%.
Wash with regular soap results in more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand rubbing with an alcoholic solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, alcohol rubbing reduces bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But water and soap are more effective than handwashing alcohol to reduce the H1N1 influenza type A virus and hard-to-replace spores. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include educating staff about handwashing, increasing the availability of alcohol handwashing, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as an essential and affordable tool for achieving good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to come up with general hand-washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa you rarely find hand-washing taps near every private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can be caused by inherent habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to a change in the behavior of the population in the long run.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand washing in lower-middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting hand washing in schools is the UNICEF “three-star approach” designed to encourage schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one star to eventually reach three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing campaigns being carried out to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns trying to bring about behaviour change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of hand washing for human health—especially for people in critical conditions such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals—was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Agnáz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishman Florence Nightingale, “the founder of modern nursing.”
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was due to bad odors called myazmas.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-care-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more effectively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from these infectious diseases.
For example, labels containing "correct ways of washing hands" were hung next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in office and airport toilets in Germany.
The phrase "wash hands from" means an announcement of one's unwillingness to take responsibility for or participate in complicity in something.
It stems from a passage in the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase that has much wider use in some English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth begins to wash her hands excessively in an attempt to purge a stain of fiction that represents her guilt for the crimes she committed and the crimes she urged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after pointing out or thinking about unethical acts, are more likely to wash their hands than others, and are more likely to appreciate hand-washing tools.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other “cleaning” compensatory procedures, such as volunteering.
Religions describe hand-washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand-washing, using water without hand-washing soap, is part of the hand-washing rituals that have emerged in many religions, including Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Tefillah, hand-washing in Judaism, washing in Christianity, and ablution in Islam. Religions also impose hygienic hand-washing, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam impose handwashing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam impose handwashing before and after each meal.
Covid-19 Risk Controls in the Workplace
COVID-19 risk controls in the workplace are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for risk control controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and job function, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the risk of disease in the community, and the risk factors for working individuals who may be at risk for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA), low-risk work involves minimal communication with the public and other co-workers, a situation in which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, coughing and sneezing etiquette, and maintaining routine practices for cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Jobs with a moderate risk of exposure include those that require frequent or close contact with individuals who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may become infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who communicated with public audiences such as in schools, high-labour-density work environments, and some large-scale retail venues.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available when dealing with a person with COVID-19.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers health care workers and bodyguards who are exposed to a person known or suspected to have COVID-19 at high levels of exposure, which increases the risk of very high exposure if workers are carrying out aerosol generation procedures, or collecting or handling samples from a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation chambers, and personal protective equipment suitable for the functional task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the quality of the goods ordered, and in ways of obtaining them (such as shopping outside peak hours, through delivery services, or shopping without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may stop. A preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive action.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and occupations, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also sets out the necessary controls to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The objectives of the outbreak response include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the society in which the business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of risk control controls is a widely used framework in the field of occupational safety and health to classify risk controls by effectiveness.
Because COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective implementation solution.
Administrative controls are changes in labor policy or procedures that require action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and management controls, but it can help prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk to the worker, correct fit as appropriate (such as breathing appliances), wear continuously and correctly, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced, as necessary, and removed, cleaned, stored, or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA), jobs with lower exposure to risk involve minimal communication with the public and other co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observance of coughing and sneezing etiquette including covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing paper napkins and garbage containers, preparing to work remotely or organizing work shifts, keeping others working sequentially if necessary, using tools, and flexing workers.
Immediate identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of severe respiratory diseases stay at home until fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms go away for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-relieving drugs or other medications that improve symptoms, that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, jobs with a moderate risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may develop SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing transmission in the workplace community, or because of a person’s recent international travel to a site where COVID-19 is spreading.
This includes worker-in-professional-in-professional-in-professional-19 and work-in-professional-19 and work-in-professional-in-professional-19 and work-in-professional-in-professional-19 and work-in-professional-19 and work-in-professional-19, work-inary-in-in-out and work-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-out, work-in-in-in-in-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out, work-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill while on an aircraft, appropriate protective controls to protect employees and other passengers include keeping the sick passenger at a distance of 6 feet from others, assigning one member of the aircraft team to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask or requiring the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
Flight crew should wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and may use additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in the biohazard prevention bag, and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and sterilized afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk control controls include postponing travel when sick, self-isolating and immediately informing the on-board medical centre if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person’s cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is present in the school building regardless of the prevalence in the community.
When there is a limited to moderate community transmission limit, social distancing strategies such as cancellation of field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes, group classes, or canteen meals can be implemented, increasing distances between offices, organizing consecutive attendance and departure times, reducing unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health desk for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant community transmission of infection, in addition to social distancing strategies, the extension of school leave dates can be considered. For law enforcement officers who carry out daily routine activities, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must contact individuals who have been confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as medical emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of direct contact during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect work belts and tools before reuse using a household cleaning spray or mop, follow standard operating procedures to deal with contamination and dispose of personal protective equipment used and to collect and wash clothes.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers that some health care workers and mortuaries fall into categories with high or very high risk levels.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratories, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become extremely high-risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures, as well as collecting or handling samples from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, certain dental procedures and tests, or invasive sample collection.
The functions of a high-risk mortuary include workers who are involved in preparing the bodies of persons confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become extremely high-risk if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these high-risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients with COVID-19, including when performing obstetric procedures.
Specialized passive pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and the preservation of dead bodies.
Samples must be handled with level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating incoming patients in separate waiting areas based on whether they are suspected of having COVID-19 or not. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends the use of respirators for those who operate at a distance of 6 feet from known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients, and those who perform aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, respirators with a face mask with an N95 filter, approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or better, must be used in the context of the Comprehensive Written Respiratory Protection Program, which includes installation and fit testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve workers’ comfort. The World Health Organization does not recommend aprons, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization only recommends the use of a surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples of COVID-19 patients, take care of them, or transport them without any procedures to generate aerosols, the World Health Organization recommends the use of a surgical mask, goggles, face protectors, and slippers and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the face mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the World Health Organization recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment through telemedicine, and physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a patient infected with COVID-19, using personal protective equipment only necessary for the specific task, and continuing to use the same breathing mask without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis.

Date/Time of transmission: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No Rights Reserved
We found ourselves in the midst of exceptional circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become a clear demonstration of the global human interdependence and responsibilities we have towards others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response depends on a kind of global empathy, cooperation and community building, which are the elements that are firmly at the heart of this institution.
The intense friendship and care we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls, and conversations is a striking demonstration of the amazing human emotions that surround, fortunately, the way we do business.
I am deeply grateful and proud to be your true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a letter expressing appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to move on to Wikipedia right now, and the powerful symbolism demonstrated by the fact that this vital resource remains available online and accessible to all individuals.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it is through the continued operation of the sites, our colleagues being paid, or the safety of our communities.
The world is in greater need of the information available in Wikipedia than ever before.
It is a moment when the positive impact in the world is not only on the efforts we make, but also on the way we do it.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make major changes in how we work together starting next week.
Modifications to Work Method and Timetables
As Rubin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.
In that discussion, we considered what we saw could be the appropriate response to what we are facing, and the ideal way to maintain the sustainability of the organization’s business during this period.
We wanted with great enthusiasm to get rid of stress and stress, and to support our mission in the long run.
If you want to reduce burdens and tasks, that’s fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working period is 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We’re not announcing a holiday, so if you’re able to work longer than normal, you might add your efforts to the task.
However, the world is now unpredictable, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get groceries or go to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We don't track your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
To allow this should be understood without expressing it, but we mention it with certainty.
Sick leave or paid leave is not required, just inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor has a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, please tell Brian at the Training and Certification Department so that the Training and Certification Department can assist with support and make sure your case is properly cared for by the Department.)
Fellows who work on an hourly basis receive their full wages.
We have already mentioned this, and we renew this commitment to our contractors and our colleagues who work hourly.
Each employee will be paid based on normal working hours during normal circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Too many people are taking advantage of work to overcome the pervasive pressures in the world around us.
What we can do will be amazingly productive, especially during difficult times like these.
Again, it’s about taking care of oneself.
We only ask you to contact your manager so that they know what to expect and adjust the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things that we need to keep going.
Site reliability engineering teams, HR operations, trust, honesty, fundraising (and others) are doing critical work, which may need further support.
We will initiate a process in collaboration with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There’s a lot of work we all have to do, and we’ll focus only on the most important projects.
Going slower now won't hurt us later.
We don’t plan to “double down time” after the pandemic ends.
We are not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and we will set new goals and timetables as appropriate.
What Happens in Annual Planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and daily working hours expectations, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule of our annual planning for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time for budget design to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones while reconciling those who need or want to work within a reduced work schedule over the next few weeks.
This timeline extension eases current planning workloads and pressure across the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Board next week and will inform delegates and teams about the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
We thank the Annual Planning Team for its leading role in this matter.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues working in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, out of extreme caution and prohibition, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team has used a class-of-virus-resistant solution used in hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building has implemented its Duty of Care protocol using products that support the safety of tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office is properly ready until we decide to go back to work.
Our Washington, D.C. office is located in a building belonging to WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all staff members at our Washington, D.C. headquarters.
Starting last week, our Washington, D.C. office moved to a completely remote location under the joint direction of our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues at our headquarters in New York City know, we have had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
Those discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it may be an adjustment, and they’d like to give you some advice:
Meeting time should be limited to a maximum of one hour or a gradual increase of up to two hours.
If longer sessions are required, think about how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda should be prepared, and material for reading should be sent in advance.
Video should be the default solution, and tools such as Google Docs and Zoom should be used to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated, with one person monitoring the conversation for questions and tracking the list of speakers, and another person to help take notes (or implement a collaborative note-taking process).
You should send an email to technical support when you need comfortable headphones.

Join the <0x23>remotes channel in the Slack app to talk to colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is looking for user-friendly guidance based on online meetings, to support the increase in business distributed across our organization.
Over the past week, we have asked all community grant recipients to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the online editors’ events of Editorathon, until the World Health Organization declares the pandemic to be over.
We have told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make the completion of agreed grant activities impossible, and that no person will be fined for having to delay or modify these objectives.
Next week we will release additional follow-up guidance related to Wikimedia and other regional and topic-specific community conferences.
The public sentiment that prevails in the global community flops between sadness over the turmoil, satisfaction with clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In light of these advances, the Crisis Response Team is designing a page in MetaWiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow up on all communications with it.
Stay up-to-date on topics related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday at 14:00 UTC, 07:00 UTC for the Working Group meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer questions and spend time communicating between us.
We go through this experience together and are always ready to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we may continue to receive information from this email, and all other necessary information related to COVID-19 available in the Office Wiki.
The Crisis Response Team will keep these pages up-to-date and keep all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contacts with staff residing in the highly affected States.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key business areas, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to inform us and cooperate with the Crisis Response Team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please send an email to Brian Gooden, Director of International Human Resources Global Operations.
None of these changes shall be deemed to be a renunciation of our assigned work or obligations.
Instead, it is a realization that at the present moment, our work and our commitments are in dire need of adapting to situations in a way that we have not experienced in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work and provide our employees with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they depend on.
The work we have planned to accomplish will be waiting for us when the time comes to complete it.
Now is the time to help each other and create a space for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and months.
We need all of you to achieve this, and so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your families to be at your best when your efforts are needed.
Please wash your hands and do not touch your face.
Catherine, Director of the Crisis Response Team (Amanda K., Amy V., Brian J., Doreen D., Gregory V., Jimmy V., Joel L., Lynette L., Ryan M., and Tony S.), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I., Heather W., Jimmy V., Janine E., E. and Liz).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binds to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, as well as the intestines.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE) counteracts the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7); making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It is also an entryway for some types of coronavirus to cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-2 converting enzyme is a metallic enzyme that contains zinc and is located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme protein 2 has an amino-terminal M2 peptidase range, and a choleptrine-carboxylic-terminal chain is a transporter of renal amino acids.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type 1 single-pass membrane protein that has active enzyme receptors present on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular portion of angiotensin-2-converting enzyme is separated from the transmembrane portion by an enzyme called chidase, resulting in the release of a soluble protein into the bloodstream and then excreted through the urine.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is found in most organs of the body: it is associated with the cell membrane of type 2 alveolar cells in the lung, in the intestinal cells of the small intestine, in the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall in most organs.
The messenger RNA of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is found in the cerebral cortex, the sternum, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The primary function of the angiotensin-2 converting enzyme is to act as a counterbalancer of the angiotensin-2 converting enzyme.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme stimulates the conversion of angiotensin 1 hormone into angiotensin 2 vasoconstrictor.
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 separates the carboxylic end of the amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin 2 (aspartate-arginine-valin-tyrosine-isolyosine-histidine-proline-phenyl-alanine-7) and dissolves it into angiotensin-7-styrene.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 breaks down into a number of other peptides including [des-arginine9]-bradriquinine, aplanine, neurotinine, dynorefine A, and gerlin.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 also regulates the membrane passage of neutral neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has a role in Hartnep disease.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, as a transmembrane protein, is the main cell entry for some coronaviruses, which include NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 binds with the enzymatic enzyme-converting range of angiotensin-2 on the cell surface to cellular replication and the transmission of the virus and enzyme to the internal particles located in the cells.
This insertion process needs to be configured by the transmembrane proteinase, the host's serin2, which is still being tested as a potential treatment. This makes some assume that lower levels of angiotensin-2-converting enzyme in cells may help with infection resistance.
In any case, many specialized associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend continuing to use the usual angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was accompanied by a marked reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group.
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia was lower among those treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, who were at greater risk of developing pneumonia, especially those with a stroke or heart failure.
“The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has led to a reduction in deaths from pneumonia, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for acute lung infections, and has been found to improve lung blood distribution, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs suffering from acute hypoglycaemic-induced dyspnoea syndrome.
The half-life of the recombinant angiotensin-2 converting enzyme is approximately 10 hours, its action starts after 30 minutes, and its effectiveness (time interval) continues up to 24 hours.
Several indications suggest that recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2 may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to conventional angiotensin resonance system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors), and in diseases accompanied by elevated angiotensin 2 in the blood. Acute treatment of angiotensin 2 is being evaluated in clinical trials, on the effect of transenzyme pumping on angiotensin II.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications specifically designed to help track people contacted in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed to design applications for contact tracking.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, particularly about systems that rely on tracking the geographical location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives to privacy include using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced together that they might integrate a functionality that supports these Bluetooth-based apps, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has published an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is an app used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, individuals use an app called TraceTogether.
The application was designed by a local IT association, released as an open source application and is scheduled to be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched StopKorona!, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected individuals and provide a rapid response to healthcare authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology in collaboration with the Ministry of Health has taken over the design of the application.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still awaiting approval from Apple’s Google Play Store and App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking app was in an advanced development phase and could become available for distribution within weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering designing apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app, as well as the Blue Trace protocol.Russia plans to roll out an app that uses the geographic virtual environment for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from Moscow residents and is designed to make sure they don’t leave their home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including pseudo-positive cases and potential ineffectiveness if applications are used only for a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious Coronavirus applications, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that can add their own Coronavirus-related applications to its app store, limiting this to “official” or other reputable organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Advocates of privacy have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance from the use of coronavirus applications, particularly as to whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will disappear immediately after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Control should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Extensions of monitoring and control should include clauses on when to stop them;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related purposes;
Data security and confidentiality should be protected and evidence-based protection should be demonstrated;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be specified by law;
Protections against abuse and protection of citizens ' rights should be available to address abuse;
The “effective participation” of all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalised groups, is required. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the ongoing monitoring problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of devices once they are no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of using apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and allowing the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to raw site data have potentially significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with centralized servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been established that use centralized servers only for interconnections (see the next section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-app-based system to carry out contact tracking operations.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking and card transaction data, and combines this data to send notifications via text messages to individuals with potential infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information publicly available, which it has allowed due to widespread changes to information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS-CoV in that country.
This information is publicly available through a number of apps and websites.Countries, including Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy-friendly systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been released.
Tracking privacy contacts is a successful concept and is supported by strong research literature dating back to at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked on privacy-compatible solutions, such as low-power Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
However, BEP-BBT and others were a coordination effort that contained both mobile and decentralized approaches, rather than an individual protocol. Decentralized protocols included privacy-preserved decentralized approach tracking (DPBT/DP-3T), and temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as call numbers, events).
In these protocols, personally identifiable data does not leave the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab was developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving technologies when collecting location data or intersecting pathways to track the spread of COVID-19.
Based on research from the March 2020 report “The Evil Face of Applications: Preserving Personal Privacy Under the Epidemic.” Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a privacy technology developer that also originated at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure device technologies to allow users to share location and health sensitive data with other users and administrators without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global Contact Number Tracking Coalition was founded by groups focused on what was essentially a similar approach and highly overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing dispersion and enabling global interoperability between tracking and alerting applications, a key feature to achieve widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol, which is used by the official government app, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control mobile operating systems Android and iOS, announced an initiative to track contacts, claiming that they would preserve privacy by combining low-power Bluetooth technology with privacy-friendly encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to roll out the system in three phases:
Tools to enable governments to create official, privacy-preserving applications to track the coronavirus
Google and Apple plan to solve ongoing usage and monitoring issues by first distributing systems through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat is gone.
A drug repositioning (also known as reuse, reallocation, goal change, or therapeutic transformation of a drug) is a repositioning of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than it was originally designed for treatment.
This is one of the scientific research methods that researchers are currently pursuing to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research trends include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the transport of congenital plasma.The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each of which contains multiple binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides the plausible plan for the development of an effective antiviral drug that eliminates COVID-19 proteins.
Among the critical target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are biphasic proteases, RNA-based RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and adenosine diphosphate rebo phosphatase.
Hussain AA and others have studied several candidate compounds that have subsequently undergone improvement and analysis for similarity of structure to approved drugs with higher similarity with the aim of accelerating the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is a malaria treatment drug that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine could be among four drugs studied as part of a clinical solidarity trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may begin on March 24.On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of chloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use License (EAU).
The treatment was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration's clinical trial process and was licensed under an emergency use license only as an experimental emergency use therapy to treat patients who have been hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
CDC announced that it had not yet determined "the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, dosage or period."
Doctors said they use the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorkine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are conducted at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
Langone School of Medicine at New York University is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Favipiravir was “obviously effective.”
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and the other half received omefenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has warned people that the existing evidence supporting the drug is incomplete and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to include it in its stockpile, and would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Newspaper, Shinzo Abe had preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug.The drug may be less effective in treating more severe cases where the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women who want to get pregnant.
One study using lopinavir/ritonavir (calitra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, reported that the results “no benefit was observed.”
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV to prevent it from cloning by binding it to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to reach a compound that binds to SARS-CoV-2 proteases.The scientific community is being criticized for diverting resources to redefining drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has added lopinavir/ritonavir to the international solidarity trial.
Gilead Sciences has developed remedesevir as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences has since discovered that remedesevir has antiviral activity in the laboratory against many nematodes, mucous viruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiretroviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that remedesevir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.There are several current clinical trials, including two conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospitals, one for patients with moderate disease and the other for patients with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials on antiviral vitamin C in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 disease, as well as two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled trial (Italy).
The state of New York began trials on the effect of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical trial on the use of Alvesco (cyclosonide) produced by Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid to treat asthma, to treat patients with the novel coronavirus before symptoms appear.
A Phase II trial using a form of angiotensin II converted enzyme is currently underway in 200 patients who are required to join the trial of acute hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, named Colcorona, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms without having to be hospitalized.
Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are also undergoing testing in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is currently widely used to treat patients, requiring the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study in Italy in 300 patients was announced to investigate the use of inoxaparin sodium in doses for disease prevention and therapeutic doses on April 14.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientific attention has focused on the reuse of approved antiviral drugs designed to deal with previous outbreaks such as Mars, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Specialists recommend Ribavirin for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines
Omifenovir: Specialists recommend the use of omifenovir for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines
Some antibiotics that specialists have identified as potentially reusable as treatments for COVID-19 include:
Tocilizumab (anti-interleukin receptor 6): Certified by China.
Experiments in Italy and China as well. See Tucilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a presumed vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five vaccine candidates in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition for Pandemic Preparedness Initiative for vaccine development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global reach.
In April, scientists from the Coalition on Pandemic Preparedness Innovations reported that 10 different technical platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The main objectives of the platform that have advanced to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus carrier (phase 1 developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, type 5 adenovirus carrier)
According to the scientists of the Coalition on Pandemic Preparedness Innovations in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information available (supposedly at the planning or design stage).
The Phase I and Phase II trial conducts a preliminary safety and immunosuppression test, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites, with more accurate and effective dosage determination.
Phase III trials typically involve a larger number of participants, including the reference group, testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring the adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates under active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (still under “preclinical” research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular synapse vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune response.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, with the aim of starting human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, led by Hannicki Schweitmacher, announced that they had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is involved in the development of an oral vaccine with her biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a study on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that used in the treatment of cancer with the novel antigen vaccine.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had finished manufacturing the vaccine and had begun testing.
On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it had started a vaccine project to synthesize the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a candidate vaccine that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Gear Command at Fort Derek and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emerging Biosolutions announced that it had formed a team with Novax Inc.
In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for pre-clinical tests and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even as the pace of work accelerated it would take at least a year and a half to approximately two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that it was developing a particle similar to the coronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is undergoing laboratory research, with plans for testing in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “significant amounts of money” for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on trans RNA.
The candidate BNT162 vaccine is currently undergoing preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would receive preclinical test results in April 2020 and its final candidate vaccine could begin testing in humans by autumn.
In France on March 19, 2020, the Pandemic Preparedness Innovations Coalition (CEPA) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium for COVID-19 vaccine research that includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, pushing the total US$29 million investment of the Pandemic Preparedness Innovations Alliance in the development of COVID-19 vaccine.
The partners of the Coalition for Pandemic Preparedness Innovations for the Development of the COVID-19 Vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing for six different candidate vaccines.
Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-amplified RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national “vaccine bank” from several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine for COVID-19 in mice, stating that "S1 subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 given with microscopic needles provoked strong responses to specific antigen antibodies [in mice]."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on DNA as a potential nasal spray.
Using phages, DNA will be designed for replication within human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called undetermined effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they are fighting.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
Vaccines being developed are likely not safe or effective.
Early research to assess vaccine efficacy using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as mice genetically modified with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, points to the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or preventive vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.
When March spread, it was thought that existing research on SARS could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against Mars-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccine (based on DARN) has completed the first phase of clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are under development, all of which were targeted for the virus, and two targeted for the adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, and BVRS).
Social media posts have sparked a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by many social media posts refer to existing patents for gene sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million people were reported infected in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly between people during socialization, often by splashing when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When sprayed during exhalation, it usually falls to the ground or on surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People may also get infected when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it may spread before onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is a polymerase chain reaction of instantaneous reverse transcription (RTT-PCR) through a nasopharyngeal swab.
Masks are recommended for those suspected of contracting the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending not to use them, some suggesting otherwise, and others calling for their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Transmission has been reported at the local level in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may not have symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is advised if you develop emergency symptoms of difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty waking up, or bluish face or lips.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Initially, some cases in China suffered only from chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully recognized; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may be contributing to the spread of the disease.
The percentage of people who are asymptomatic is currently unknown and is under study, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases were asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China’s National Health Commission began listing asymptomatic cases in the daily tally on April 1; out of 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Sputum and saliva may carry large proportions of the virus.
Speaking loudly produces more spray than talking normally.
A study in Singapore has shown that coughing without covering the mouth can lead to spray scattering up to 4.5 meters (15 ft) away.
Although the virus is not usually transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted by bioaerosols, and testing samples of air collectors in the hallway outside individuals’ rooms has yielded positive results for viral RNA.
Certain medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause respiratory secretions to be released in the form of a spray, and then the virus spreads through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through stool, it is thought that the risk is limited.The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some ambiguity about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three more people in general. The virus remains stuck on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to persist for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and disinfectants are also effective provided they are used correctly; soap dissolves the virus’ protective oily membrane and stops its action, as well as clears the skin and other surfaces from it.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken after an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test, the sixth showed the highest viral load.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus associated with SARS-CoV-2, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in the acute respiratory disease group in Wuhan.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus shares its properties with related coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, household soap eliminates the virus, destroying its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the two organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells by the ACE2 enzyme, which is the most abundant in type 2 alveolar cells found in the lung.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called spike to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, suffered severe heart attacks, more common in critical cases.
Cardiovascular symptom rates are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute heart muscle injury may also be associated with AC2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors play a very important role in the heart and are involved in the performance of its functions.
The rate of clots (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) in patients in the intensive care unit with COVID-19 increased, which may be linked to poor prognosis. Autopsies of individuals who died of COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory leakage containing lymphocytes within the lymphocytes.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is directed towards ACE2-expressing epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients experience symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T cells that secrete pathogenic GMSSF have been shown to be associated with bringing in the only cells that secrete inflammation-causing Interleukin 6 and exacerbated lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphatic infiltration was also reported at the autopsy.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several test protocols for the disease.
The instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTT-PCR) is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually done using respiratory samples taken from a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or mucus sample can also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it requires two blood samples with a two-week gap and results with a simple direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and spread the gene sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect an active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experiment on the test showed that the accuracy is only between 60 and 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical care point test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested ways to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Double-sided, polylobular glazing with an asymmetrical peripheral and posterior spread is a common feature at the beginning of injury.
Sublateral spread and stone alignment (thickness of the lobular barrier with uneven alveolar filling) may appear as the disease progresses.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological conclusions from the autopsy:
Microscopy: Pleuritis, pericarditis, lung enlargement and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pulmonary cell hyperplasia, atypical large alveolar cells, transient inflammation with lymphatic infiltration and multinuclear giant cell formation
Acute pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar discharge.
Pervasive alveolar damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of discharge in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: circulating intravascular coagulation (DIC); white blood cell reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, and it is recommended to use the inside of the elbow if a napkin is not available.
It is recommended to clean your hands thoroughly after any coughing or sneezing.
CDC has recommended the use of canvas face coverings in public, in part to reduce the transmission of asymptomatic people.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Spacing guidelines also include that people distance at least 6 feet (1.8 m) from each other.
There is no drug known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected to be invented until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as “curve flattening”.
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are clearly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
Hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol is also recommended when only soap and water are not available.For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the World Health Organization offers two formulations for local production.
Antimicrobial activity in these two formulations arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is “not an effective disinfectant for hands.”
Add glycerol as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and reliance on a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) and China’s National Health Commission have published recommendations for caring for those hospitalized for COVID-19.
Intensive care specialists and lung specialists in the United States have collected treatment recommendations from diverse bodies in a free resource, the Critical Case Care Book, available online.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some specialists recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings, when performing procedures that may result in a spray, such as intubation or manual breathing.
For healthcare professionals taking care of COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends placing the person in the isolation room for airborne infection (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, mixing precautions and airborne disease precautions. The CDC explains the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during airborne illnesses.
Recommended tools: aprons for personal protective equipment, respirator or face mask, eye guards, and medical gloves. Respiration appliances (instead of face masks) should be used if available.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial plants, but the Food and Drug Administration has authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use License (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in the case of uses for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face protectors or homemade masks as a last resort.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require artificial breathing or alternatives, but some cases do.
The type of respiratory support provided to people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure in hospitals is being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided using a high-flow nasal cannula or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these options is of the same benefit to those with a critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to continue using gas ventilators when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula. Critical cases are more frequent among older people (over 60 years of age, especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, limiting the health system’s ability to cope with the surge in the number of serious COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required artificial respiratory support, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30 percent of those hospitalized for COVID-19 are eventually admitted to intensive care units.
Ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in people with COVID-19 and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Respirators need to have pressure control modes and high positive expiratory end pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of respiratory and thoracic pneumonia-related lung injury.
High positive exhalation pressure may not be available in older respirators.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial stage.
Remedy seems to be the most evangelizing of them.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs undergoing testing have already been approved for other uses or are already at an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried on people with a critical condition.
The World Health Organization has recommended volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license to use convalescent plasma as an experimental therapy in cases where a person's life is seriously or directly threatened.
It has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove that it is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect ‘contacts’ using surveillance data and thus the risk of possible infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials.Big data analytics for mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and their associates in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security services to track the mobile phone data of those presumed to be infected with the coronavirus.
Action has been taken to quarantine and protect potential contacts with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italy’s regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said mobile phone companies told him that “40% of people are still moving everywhere.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon on a weekend in which more than 42,000 people took part.
Estonia’s President, Kirsti Kaljulaid, has also launched a global call to showcase innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or fear of injury itself.
According to Rory O’Connor, “increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic stagnation is a major storm that harms people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may take a mild course that involves minor or asymptomatic symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as a cold.
Minor cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of data on COVID-19.
In those most affected, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 are sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
6% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized were diagnosed with an abnormality of blood clotting, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while 4% of those with impaired kidney function were observed.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated levels of liver enzymes (amine transporters).
According to the report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, including five days in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for those transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In an early case study, the average time from the onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and on a total level of cases ranged from six days to 41 days.
In a study conducted by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), men’s mortality rate was 2.8% while women’s mortality rate was 1.7%.
Histopathological anatomical examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromexide secretions in both lungs.
Changes in viral cytopathy have been observed in alveolar cells.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed in 11.8% of deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those hospitalized had previous conditions.The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic status of the region may also affect deaths.
Estimates of deaths resulting from the condition vary as a result of these differences between regions, but also due to methodological difficulties.
A deficient enumeration of minor cases may lead to an overestimation of the death rate from the truth.
However, the fact that previous cases have caused deaths may suggest that the current mortality rate is lower than the truth.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong hospital has revealed a 20 to 30 percent reduction in lung capacity in some recovering patients, and lung tests have indicated damage.
This may also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections were gaining long-term and effective immunity to the disease.
Immune acquisition is seen as a possibility, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported to have recovered from COVID-19 and later re-infected.
It is believed that these conditions worsen if the infection persists rather than when it recurs.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, given the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 is the first date symptoms appear.
Official WHO publications report that December 8, 2019 is the first date symptoms appear.
Several measures are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of the screenings, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time taken since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) allocated the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Emergency Code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and Code U07.2 to COVID-19-diagnosed deaths during clinically or epidemiologically specific person-to-person deaths.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death toll from injuries is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region.Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of people who have been found to have died from a disease, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of people who have been infected (who have been found and who have not been found) and who have died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they follow a specific population from injury to fate.
Although antibodies may not be produced by all infected bodies, their presence may provide information about how many people are infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione di Ada, a small village with a population of 4,600, has already killed 80 people (1.7%).
In Ganglet, the disease spread due to carnival festivals, and passed on to young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and probably not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as caused by it.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overstretched.
In the Netherlands, perhaps about 3% have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed due to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate vary between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies in China and Italy.
The maximum risk for men is at 50 years of age, with the difference between men and women only fading at 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of these sex differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, non-smoking prevalence among women and men with concurrent conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to a higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The highest proportion of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have an increased risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained that Ko is an abbreviation of the word coronavirus, and in the abbreviation of the virus d is an abbreviation of disease and 19 refers to the year the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographic location (such as China), animal species or group of people, in line with international label recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-2-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the WHO uses the terms “Covid-19” and “Covid-19-responsible virus” in public statements.
The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "Coronavirus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "Coronavirus" and "Wuhan Coronavirus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the use of the names New Coronavirus-2019 and Acute Respiratory Disease Associated with New Coronavirus-2019 as temporary names for the virus and the disease according to the 2015 guidelines banning the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies are exporting health care materials such as nose swabs and respirator parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve and the supplier was unable to deliver on time, a local startup reversed its engineering and issued the required 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged regarding the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no drugs or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a “solidarity trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
A vaccine is not available, but various bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies of SARS-CoV are used because it resembles SARS-CoV-2 in using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under consideration.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to trigger an immediate immune response in the human body against a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the SPIC-S protein, which helps the virus break into ACE2 receptors.
The third strategy is for DNA vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for inventing a vaccine).
The experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies must be tested for safety and effectiveness.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an innocuous genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent euthanasia has been cited as a potential challenge to the creation of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs proposed for reuse in the treatment of the new disease make up most of China’s research, with nine phase III trials of remedicivir across several countries due to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and potential COVID-19 drugs has been conducted as of April 2020. Several antiviral drugs that exist for COVID-19 treatment are being evaluated, including remedicivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/tonavir combined with interferon.
There is preliminary evidence of the efficacy of remedicivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with Remedyvir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, formerly used for malaria treatment, was studied in China in February 2020, and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for a peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute for Virus Research notes that although a dose of one gram is recommended, double this dose is very dangerous and may cause death.
On March 28, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use license for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of treating physicians for COVID-19 sufferers.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further study of the effect of nitazoxanide on organisms has been recommended after its inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 low concentrations has been demonstrated. Studies have shown that the initial formation of a spike protein via TMPRSS2 transmembrane serin protein is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant deficiencies that prevented the medical community from accepting these therapies without further study.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
A cytokine storm may be a complication in the late stages of acute COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.The China National Health Commission added to its treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
He is undergoing a non-random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe conditions.
In addition to its use in serum ferritin testing to identify cytokine storms, it aims to counter such developments, which are believed to be the cause of death in some patients.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody therapy for chimeric antigen receptor T cells, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of cytokine secretion syndrome for non-steroid-responders with a different cause in 2017.
To date, there is no controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine secretion syndrome.
The method of transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of recovering COVID-19 patients is subject to study as a non-vaccination method of passive inoculation.
This strategy was tested on SARS and the results were inconclusive.
Neutralization of the virus represents the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can act as a mediator of defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms may be used, such as antibody-based or phagocytotoxicity, or both.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
Serum production, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies to the virus, can be increased to make it spread faster.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was later infected and died of COVID-19 after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
