Members of Parliament in Wales are afraid to ‘look like puppets’
Some MPs were appalled by the proposal that the title of their roles be changed from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern arose as a result of plans to change the name of the deleted house to Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are concerned that this will invite mockery.
One Labour MP said his people feared that "it would rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
A member of parliament from the Plaid Kamri party said that all of his members were “unhappy” and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his friends were “open to suggestions” about the name change, but noted that the name MWP (the acronym for the Welsh MP) sounded very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the expression of the letter u in English with the Yokeshire accent.
The House Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation, said: "The final decision on any word of description as to the names of the members of the House of Representatives is of course the decision of the members of the House of Representatives themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh legislature the power to change its name.
In June, the committee released the results of the public consultation on the proposals, in which broad support was given to changing the name of the legislature to Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of the role of MPs, the committee recommended the "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in consultation with the public.
Members of parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to achieve consensus could cause quite a bit of a headache for committee chairman Elaine Jones, who is due to submit a draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the workings of the legislature, including rules for disenfranchisement of members of parliament and the structure of the committee system.
It is the vote of members of parliament that will ultimately determine the title of their role during legislative debates.
Macedonians go to the polls in referendum on changing country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of Northern Macedonia.”
The referendum was set in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a district called Macedonia.
Greece has long claimed that its northern neighbor is a claim to Greece's territory and has reneged on Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore its results.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in the neighborhood of Harlem
According to Mr. Adams, “old neighborhood residents say there used to be a bar and a church in every corner.”
“There are no bars or churches today.”
You can understand the disappearance of the bars.
“People’s lives today are different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the heads of the churches expect, "and sooner or later they will find themselves at the beginning again."
He said the churches would be replaced by apartment buildings with shared homes that would house people who were not the type to help the neighborhoods maintain their unique character.
“The vast majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he says, “and therefore this will hasten the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that the majority of the people who move to these apartments will join these churches.”
The two churches were built by white faith communities before Harlem became a predominantly black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's Ten Years Later.
The white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
A black community of believers operating in the area became the owner of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was handed over to a black community of believers under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who imposed a ban on merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused heavy damage to the building, but as part of the plans of the faithful under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they ordered the construction of the bell carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson Sr. and successor to St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the carriage “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carriage in July called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical tool.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first bell carriage in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who later played the larger carriage at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said that the Church of St. Martin had not replaced him.
What has happened in St. Martin’s Church over the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by local church leaders, and others by the episcopal bishopric.
The assembly—the governing body of the local congregation of believers—wrote a letter to the bishops in July outlining its fears that the bishops would “try to roll the costs” to the assembly, even though the assembly was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some believers have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy in a lobster trap.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived to catch lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Ensenitas.
Chad Hummel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed there with a group to help pull him to the beach.
At first, Hummel thought it was just shouts of enthusiasm about catching a lobster, but later he realized that the boy was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Hummel said that when he approached the boy, he saw that "his whole clavicle had been torn off."
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was flown to the Radi Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as humane.
It is not known which species of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue commander Larry Giles said in a briefing that a shark had been identified in the area a few weeks earlier, but was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Kasbalad to Swami Basinitas Beach for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to penetrate the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury’s starts a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens department store-style transitions with professional saleswomen.
As part of a major initiative to penetrate the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion-a-year beauty products market, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and home products decline, the expanded transitions of beauty products will be tested at 11 stores across the country and, if successful, added to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as supermarkets look for ways to use shelf space that has been captured by TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said the company is expected to double its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also gain additional space with dedicated brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket chain is also re-launching its makeup line – Boutique – so that most products will be vegan-friendly, a feature that is increasingly in demand among young shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will examine franchises at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croyden, South London, last week and the second will open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and beyond buying smaller amounts of food every day in local convenience stores require supermarkets to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the branches will become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight cheaper chains Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has added Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores as well as a number of Habitat points since acquiring the two chains two years ago, adding to what it says has boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The network’s previous attempts to revive its beauty products departments and pharmacies ended in failure.
Sainsbury’s tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the engagement ended after a dispute over how to divide the profits from pharmacies within supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold the business operations of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the program by expanding the range of premium skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Sainsbury’s Commercial Director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty product transitions to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we have invested in employees who are specially trained and will be accessible to provide advice on the spot.
Our brand offering is tailored to suit every need and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for purchasing beauty products, challenging the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones Angry After Holly Willaby Cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
The star of the TV show Dragons Den, Peter Jones, expressed “anger” after television presenter Holly Willaby canceled an 11 million-dollar deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marx <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
To be honest, Willoughby doesn't have time for their homewear and accessories brand.
The joint business between the two is considered to be similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter This Morning announced her departure in a post on Instagram.
Holly Willaby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious to cancel at the last minute her participation in the prestigious lifestyle brand of the two – to focus on her fat contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones reacted “angry” when the TV star announced during a tumultuous meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that due to its new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 – she did not have enough time left to devote to the brand of their home clothes and accessories.
The joint business was considered similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, which was estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willaby posted on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from the UK to one of his resorts.
One source said: “Truely was undoubtedly Holly’s top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income in the coming decades.
The decision to leave completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
The company’s warehouses in Marlo are full of products that are ready for sale.”
Experts believe leaving This Morning, one of the UK’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions as a result of huge investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to household clothes, and the potential for further delays in launching.
This could lead to the end of a long friendship.
Willabi, who is a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Terra Cup for ten years.
Willaby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the company as chairman in March.
The couple spent the holidays together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willaby will become the M<0x26>S brand’s ambassador and replace Annette McArthurlin as I’m a Celebrity presenter on ITV’s I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We are not commenting on his business affairs.”
A tough conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about being criticized by the news media for statements some define as "non-presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump made so many concessions?
Trump said in a “news pitcher” voice.
"I didn't make any concessions."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after praising their first meeting in June as a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have frozen.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "responsive response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions designed to keep up the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“We’re in a good situation with North Korea,” he said.
"We've almost gone to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results—the cessation of missile tests, aid in the release of prisoners, and the repatriation of the remains of U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual attitude when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have devastated an island and killed hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has lost their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a condition for accelerating international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international aid, so it’s a bit challenging,” Ms. Sombong said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign emissaries will be able to cross the area.
Mr. Sotofu, a spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if more international services would contribute to the relief effort.
In light of the earthquakes that are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately insufficiently prepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh province, they are rare in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami warnings in Palu, even though there is a warning, contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship set up in Lombok to treat earthquake victims makes its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
Improving Indonesia’s poor infrastructure is at the center of President Joko Widodo’s campaign, and he has invested heavily in roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko is facing funding deficits ahead of his re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious radicalization of the country’s Muslim majority.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have lost their homes in fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets – using knives, bows and arrows and other domestic weapons.
Video: Daniel Stridge of Liverpool matches last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridge received a pass from Shakiri's office about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal and his team is 1-0 behind.
He bounced the ball to his left and then turned a kick towards the far beam.
The ball flew high above the plaza and landed in the upper right corner of the net.
Eventually, the ball landed above the goalkeeper Kappa Arisvalga who jumped at it and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq are always playing as forward as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible,” Surridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kanta and I did one touch and I didn’t think about it too much and I just kicked.”
Chelsea led 0-1 in the half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blue forward made a pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in the same game, before turning close to the midfield and quickly running into Liverpool's halffield.
Kovacic performed a quick ‘let go’ maneuver in the middle of the court.
Then he kicked a beautiful cross, which led Hazar into the plaza.
Hazard came ahead of the defense and finished with the ball in the top right corner of the goal, with a left kick passing Liverpool player Allison Becker.
Livpol will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s quake and tsunami has climbed to 832, the country’s disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Several people have been reported trapped in the demolition of buildings that collapsed in Friday’s 7.5 magnitude quake, which caused waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nervuho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered in ruins from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police have opened a murder investigation after the body of a woman was found this morning in Bikinihead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling people from the area who have seen or heard something to contact them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I would like to urge anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera, to contact us, because the footage may contain information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
Friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police say they are now in the process of delivering messages to relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Muise has just tried to enter his apartment, but has been told that police forbid anyone from entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will be hours before they can return to their apartments.
A sounded policeman tells one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was seen at the scene tearing.
She comes back and says, “It’s terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were seen inside the scene and another outside.
Several policemen stood inside the scene aiming at people in the apartment building.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message on Twitter to <0x40>MerPolCC, dial 101 or contact anonymously Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and indicate the log number 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's Parliament Statue has become the next target for attacks on memorials in the struggle around 'rewriting history'
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice in light of the removal of the Talibani by his Puritan supporters of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England.
But the Cromwell Society argues that Mr. Creek’s proposal is “stupid” and “trying to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that in the current controversy over the removal of statues, the image of Oliver Cromwell standing outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The shattering of the statues of the Civil Wars in England was not done at Cromwell's command nor was it done by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell falls victim to the actions of one of his predecessors in the dynasty—Thomas Cromwell—in the century before.
Cromwell’s impressive representation in the hands of sculptor Sir William Hammo Thorncroft is a testament to a 19th-century view and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe still deserves to be respected.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromowell was seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as defending Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course, the monarchy.
The question of whether this is a completely accurate assessment is the subject of ongoing historical controversy.
The undisputed fact is that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation later on, and Cromwell is one identifiable figure representing one side of the barricade at the time.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration.”
A Chinese farmer is killed by a pig.
Local media sources report that a pig attacked a farmer's death in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified by his family name Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery covered in blood near the pigsty in Lupenshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Shening, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day his cousin found him dead, and found that the door to a pigsty nearby was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A criminal investigation has confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kg attacked the farmer to death.
“My uncle’s legs were full of blood and sprained,” said his cousin, whose last name was Wu, quoted in the Guiyang Evening News.
On security camera footage, Yuan was seen entering the market Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars to prevent it from attacking more people as police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family is reportedly negotiating with market authorities about compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused a man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had handcuffed a Wales farmer to his tractor until the farmer's wife ran away from the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood may be “triggered.”
“They’re just playing.
They're like naughty, very inquisitive kids... They don't mean to hurt you.
We just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in large areas of the southwestern United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters on the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding throughout northern Mexico and southwestern the United States over the next few days.
The winds in the Rosa storm reached speeds of 135 km/h, which is a Category 1 hurricane, and as of Sunday at 5 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, the storm’s focus is 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a canal is starting to form over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward toward the eastern coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical humidity north into the U.S. Southwest.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical humidity combined with the approaching channel will produce heavy rainfall in large areas of the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause flash floods and risk landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 50 to 100 mm is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona.
There may be flash floods with conditions that deteriorate rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rushing rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust storms.
The approaching channel will bring local rainfall to parts of Southern California’s coastline.
There could be total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which could lead to waste erosion and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region this rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will start approaching Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and the rain will be stronger and spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be sharp temperature changes all over the United States, while the Arctic is cooling but the tropics remain fairly warm.
This often leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
Sunday is a great example of extreme temperature changes across Central America.
There are temperature differences of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, prolonged summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
In early October, temperatures will be warm in most of the central and eastern U.S. regions, ranging from 27-31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast shows high prospects for higher-than-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Burt Kavanaugh’s hearing.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political debate continues, with news flashes in the middle of regular broadcasts announcing a surprising development on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had touched her body while drunk and tried to strip her naked during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in enthusiastic testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers was even higher than the 20.4 million reported by the Nielsen Index.
Nielsen tested average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time measuring people who watch offices.
By comparison, this is a viewership on a scale similar to that of the football playoffs or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose commentators enthusiastically support Cavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing.
ABC finished second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The level of interest remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican senator’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Cavanaugh’s appointment, he was photographed by CNN and CBS photographers as a group of protesters yelled at him as he tried to get into the elevator to get to a legal committee hearing.
He stood with a humble gaze for a few minutes as protesters decried him, with all of this filmed live on CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement saying, before the elevator door closed, that he would say more at a committee hearing.
Broadcasting and cable networks all aired live a few hours later, when the legal committee was about to vote on Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only vote for the nomination if there was an understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, as demanded by members of the Democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Koons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not have a majority to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without an investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May Accuses Critics of ‘Playing in Politics’ on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of ‘playing politics’ with Britain’s future and damaging the national internet, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued to attack her “dama game” for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU would back each other’s tariffs was “completely unfounded.”
Wade Simms shooting: Police arrested Deaton Simpson as suspect in murder of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the LSU team.
A 20-year-old man named Deaton Simpson has been arrested and imprisoned for first-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report by WAFB, which is part of CBS.
After Simpson's investigation, police said he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
The bail was set at $350,000, as reported by Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Department of Pathology published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and to the neck.
The police gave credit to the Louisiana state police task force to capture fugitives, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police, and the local civilians who assisted in the investigation that led to the suspect’s capture.
LSU’s director of athletics, Joe Alva, thanked local law enforcement for “the diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Simms was 20.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “shocked” and “shocked” by Wade’s death.
“That’s what you’re afraid of all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano emits ash on Mexico City
Ashes ejected from the volcano Popocatépetl reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
In the center there are a number of noises and tremors.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash covering on car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Sucimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano 72 km (45 miles) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clash between police and Catalan separatists as the anniversary of the independence vote approaches
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police forces to disperse demonstrations, and thousands joined demonstrations against the first anniversary of Catalonia’s independence vote.
A group of masked separatists stopped by the police to disperse the demonstrations, threw eggs at the police and spread paint powder to create black dust clouds on the streets, usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes also erupted later that day when police were forced to use clubs to overcome the protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “We will not forget, we will not forgive” stood up to pro-unity supporters who called “Long live Spain.”
The local press reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered by the protesters.
Tensions remained high in pro-independence areas a year after the referendum held on October 1 was ruled illegal by the Spanish government, but celebrated by pro-independence Catalans.
Voters voted by a large majority to become an independent state, although the turnout was low when those opposed to the secession boycotted the vote.
Catalan government officials said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent polling in violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups set up overnight camps on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcisse Thermas, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he had lost hope about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
“Last year we had our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying over being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although Catalan separatist parties won an important, albeit pressing, election last December, they struggled to maintain momentum this year as many of their best-known leaders are in voluntary exile or jails awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum, followed by the declaration of independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police demonstration on his phone, said the confrontation was being sparked by politicians on both sides of the barricade.
“It’s getting worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Yonkers, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail pending trial since late last year, announced he would run in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we witnessed from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after car crashed into house
Three men – aged 33, 34 and 39 – were arrested after a car crashed several times into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Linnegarg Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective investigator Bob Balmings said the gates were damaged, as well as the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point an arrow was fired from a bow towards the car.
Manga kick gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who has just risen to the league, stunned Rangers and coach Steven Gerrard that this is only his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Manga's kick was significant because Gary Holt's team moved to second place with Hibernian.
Gerard’s team is left without a win outside the Premier League this season, and will face leader Harts, behind whom it lags by eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends the home run to six games, and head coach Holt hasn't had a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against a weakly hosted team
Holt’s team was supposed to lead long before they scored a goal, with their straightforwardness causing Rangers various problems.
Scott Robinson rushed forward but dragged his attempts before a gate, and afterwards Alan Lethgoy could only focus his efforts across the board after slipping in to meet Craig Helget's knock before the gate.
The hosts were willing to let the Ranger play ahead of them, knowing that they could make it harder for the host team in free kicks.
And that's how the decisive gate took place.
The Rangers took a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block Manga, who made a touchdown and scored a goal from the center of the field.
At this point, the Rangers controlled possession of the ball but discovered that home defense was impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained virtually unthreatened.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the goal.
Scott Vietnam was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Leith Goy touched another free kick ball of Livingston.
Crossed balls continued to enter Livingston's plaza and be blocked, while two penalty balls - after a strike on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one on a hand touch - were removed.
"Amazing" by Livingston - Surgery
Alastair Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Amazing game and amazing result from Livingston.
All the players were excellent, and continued to exceed expectations in this upward spurt.
Their style of play and the staffing of the players have hardly changed since they returned to the leading position, but Holt deserves a lot of credit for the way he has shaped the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holkett was awesome, and led a superbly organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warell on high alert all the way.
But the Rangers were uninspired.
Although they were sometimes quite good under Jarrar, they did not meet these standards.
They lacked the final ball – only once they opened the home team’s defense – and this is a red light for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
A mixed reception for Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO countries.
They were divided on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s admission to the European Union.
From there, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an continued to participate in the opening of a new huge mosque.
Cologne is the city with the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police announced security reasons for blocking 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, many of them Kurds, have also spoken out, protesting both Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policies and Germany’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protesters reflect the controversy around the guest, who is praised as a hero by some Turks in Germany and condemned as a tyrant by others.
Car Accident in Deptford: Motorcyclist Killed in Car Crash
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Westwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 p.m.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and paramedics treated the injured man, but the man died on the spot.
The collision came after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childer Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
Police say they are trying to identify the victim and notify his relatives.
Instead of roadblocks and buses directed to alternative routes, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Injured in Riot
Six guards were injured in a riot in a men's secure prison, the prison's office said.
The riot erupted at Long Lartine Prison in Westershire on Sunday at around 9:30 p.m. British time, and is still ongoing.
Special officers from the Tornado Unit were brought to the scene to eliminate the riot, which included eight prisoners and was blocked to one wing.
Guards were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained guards have been recruited to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards were treated for injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those involved will be handed over to the police and their prison sentences may be extended.”
The Long Lartin prison housed 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor had been treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which guards were attacked with snooker sticks.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical sinking to strike Arizona, but it’s exactly what’s expected early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the desert in the southeast and bring with them the danger of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already announced the danger of flash floods on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Storm Rosa is expected to pass a direct course over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the end of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only ten tropical cyclones remain in the status of a tropical storm or tropical depression within a range of 322 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 60 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the Arizona Hurricane Center anticipate 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the Arizona Mugulon margin.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated places receiving a total of 50 mm.
For those outside the flash flood risk zone, the rain of the Rosa storm may be a blessing because the area has suffered from drought.
Although flooding is a serious danger, some of these rains will be helpful because the southwest region is currently suffering from drought conditions.
According to U.S. Drought Monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona is in severe drought, which is the second most severe category,” according to weather.com.
First, the course of the Rosa storm will reach land across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Storm Rosa, still in hurricane force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of about 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, and therefore weakens.
Therefore, it is expected to reach land in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico could be heavy and cause a risk of flooding.
Total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm, weather.com reports.
The Rosa storm will then continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger to be expected from the Rosa storm, or its remnants, is heavy rains in Baja California, Southwest Sonora and the Southwest Desert in the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and life-threatening waste streams in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Midsmart Excelsior Terrace area of Norton on Sunday at around 4:00 p.m. British time.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, according to the flotilla.
The police are asking anyone who may have cell phone footage of what happened to contact the police.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘suffered the viciousness and anger’ of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s outrageous rudeness and tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Welling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered the viciousness, the anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and passionately denying the accusation of Kristin Blazy Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the people of the United States saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“The vote to confirm the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the most outstanding legal minds of our time, a jurist with an outstanding record of public service,” he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks until one of the most important votes in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m a candidate,” he said.
“That’s why I’m running everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats were on a mission to “resist and interfere.”
A senior Republican Party aide told CNN that the first central procedural vote in the Senate plenary on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, number rises
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them swept away by huge waves as a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, official sources reported on Saturday.
Many people gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday, when waves of about 6 meters (18 feet) high crashed on the beach at sunset, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still dealing with their affairs on the shoreline and did not immediately flee, and they fell victim,” BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purvo Noruho said at a briefing in Jakata.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nuruhu said, adding that the tsunami was moving across the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed the destruction of a large number of homes and shops, bent bridges and courtyards, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Secondary shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s powerful earthquake was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
He said the geography of the city, which sits at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Noruho described the destruction as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nuruhu said the death toll and damage could be greater along the northern Palu with a 300-kilometer (190-mile) coastline, an area called Dongla, and closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The media “completely collapsed and there is no information” from Dongla, Noruhu said.
More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not announcing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves came as the warning was issued.
In an amateur video circulated on social media, you can see a man on the high roof of a building shouting hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people in the street below him.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes onto the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the photograph.
The quake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but survivors are still in desperate need of food and other essentials.
The city's airport will only be opened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the bailout centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very difficult.
As World Vision staff from Dongla arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers sheltered in shelters made of tarpaulin erected in their office yards, they passed sights of destruction on their way, Mr. Dosba said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as aid groups began the unfortunate operations of gearing disaster relief, some complained that they had been prevented from reaching Palo by experienced foreign aid workers.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, funding, supplies and people from other countries can only start flowing if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Olya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open the door to international aid, but that status has not been declared.”
As the second night on Palo fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing clung to the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that illuminate the grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under wreckage for two days, with her mother’s body next to her.
Gandon Sovandono, the coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, has trained two missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Rao Rao Rao, including Mr. Mendegue, were his students.
“Old in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roar Rae Hotel became widespread among the paratroopers community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palo, who were taking part in the beach festival.
But his messages showed only one gray check mark, instead of a pair of blue ones.
“I think it means that the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take in $26,750 while filling an ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Rinx employee who filled an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and prepared to bring more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “runs behind a Brinks employee” and steals a bag with money to fill at an ATM.
A witness saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity that used to be known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He is replacing singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for “emotional reasons,” the programme’s creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means 'you'," West said earlier this year, speaking about the name of his album with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It has gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to ‘Ye’ – just a reflection of the good in us, the bad in us, or the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He's one of a few famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Coombs was also known as Puff Daddy, P Daddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names "Love" and "Brother Love."
A former West partner, Jay-Z, also moved between versions of his name with and without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Teltalolco Square “never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
Military forces fired on a non-violent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who study and opening more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into crime gangs.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
As China’s AI activity increases, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI research, says AI researcher Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even as the U.S. government has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Double the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the odds that the next big AI milestone will be achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Li, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in China’s most prominent artificial intelligence company, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top-ranked Reversi player in the U.S., and later served as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Advanced Research Projects Robotics Challenge, and asked when she would be next to help identify the visionaries ahead.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government grants, he told me.
“It’s not China that takes our leading academic researchers, it’s the business companies that do it,” Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited stars from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think we should automatically offer a green card to those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its next generation AI development plan.
The China National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center designed to bring together industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a special artificial intelligence committee.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an artificial intelligence initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. legislative initiative to create a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country’s name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name is a claim to Greece's territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change will hurt the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the number of voters would meet the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the ballot is: “Are you in favor of joining NATO and the EU upon the agreement with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, argue that it is a price worth paying so that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the dissolution of Yugoslavia, can join bodies such as the European Union and NATO.
“I came here today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means a protected life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgiezbeka in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would comply with the results of the vote to make it a determinant.
To change the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, in which 66 percent of the people with the right to vote came to vote.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old José Tenevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, his wife Zurich and his son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko complete their ballot in Stromica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country’s name, which will open the door to its accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament house in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small bench and chairs in front of tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with an upright head, not through the entry of servants,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian union.”
Prime Minister Zeev said NATO members would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
“I believe the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zeev said after voting.
He said a positive outcome would be “securing our future.”
A poll released on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum – less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma TV, found that 57 respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, the percentage of voters must be at least 50 percent plus one.
The referendum’s failure would be the first significant loss of pro-Western government policy since it seized power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player Sergio Agüero navigates through Brighton’s entire defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling broke through Brighton’s defense in a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Agüero seemed to win the gate with ease.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defensive players before breaking into the open field.
At this point, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before getting a few more on the Brighton Expansion line.
Then he kicked a pass to the left, and he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch on the pitch to pass the ball back to Aguero, who kicked Brighton goalkeeper Mateo Ryan with a ball to the right of the net.
“Aguaro has problems with his feet,” the manager of Manchester City told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave Blue Sky the initial advantage in the Premier League rivalry.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton during this time.
He sent a great crossing ball across the right flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sanne dribbled the ball before leading Sterling to the far end of the beam.
The Blue Sky player pushed the ball into the net just before he slid out of the field.
Manchester City will face Oppenheim in the Champions League home game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Siegesheim, Germany.
He wants to play spoiler against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But a highly competitive racer hopes to win against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if it still has implications for the Rockies, who lead one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have secured at least an open ticket spot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but have not yet secured their first place at home.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the spectators and the second team will probably play at the highest level at any point I face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to face it?”
The Nationals haven't announced the starter for Sunday, but they're reportedly inclined to let the chaplain serve in such a situation.
Charcer, who will be the 34th start of his career, held a training session on Thursday and will serve on his rest day – Sunday.
Washington's right-hand pitcher has a record 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 rounds 2/3 of the season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly hinted at the situation around his elected Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five more weeks to the most important election of our lives.
"It's one of the most, the most -- I'm not running, but actually I am running, so I'm running everywhere and fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this awful and terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if you're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the evils, the vileness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they need to run over to gain power and control, that’s what they want is power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he says, are on a mission to “resist and interfere.”
“And you’ve been seeing this for the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry and mean and despicable and dishonest.”
He named the minority leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which drew high-profile contempt from the crowd.
“Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, whatever.
No, no, no, I waited until -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a pluralistic place.
They are intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When momentum activists at my local party branch voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome – and only because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, to Europe – for the most part ironically, issues similar to those about which Jeremy disagreed with previous party leaders.
The committee on the meeting of the East Nottingham Labour Party on Friday said: “We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, the General Committee meetings on Friday evenings were exactly like this.
Fortunately, this is not the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of “more kind, more gentle” politics has long since been forgotten, if ever.
It becomes increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views, and every opinion is judged to be acceptable to the party leadership.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy was elected party leader, when colleagues who once thought we shared a similar political view began to expect him to turn his back and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with—whether on national security or on a single European market.
Every time I speak in public — and it doesn’t really matter what I say — there’s an abusive stream of social media reprimands with calls for impeachment, condemnation of the center’s politics and calls that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a raft of racist abuse every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are already the same pluralistic place, and with every decision of disbelief or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more troubled.
Over the past two years, many have advised me to keep my mouth shut, not be so loud, and then I’ll be fine.
But that’s not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, shaken by the Thatcher government’s negligence that has almost caused my public school classroom to fall apart, I’ve been looking for ways to fight for better social services for those who need them most — whether as a local councilor or a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could have been in any way confused as to my political positions and the subjects of my disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the resolution on Friday, all I have to say is that as the country crawls toward a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses, and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But to be honest, the one message I have is not to the momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of impeachment threats or political utilitarianism will deter me from acting in a way that I believe serves the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Air to the top
The last two freshmen slightly tipped the score, but there is no doubt that Ayer deserves a win in today’s fun and wonderful game in the Scottish Premier League.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the teenager.
In the end, it was their better defense, as well as taking much more risks, playing for the home team, and Coach Peter Murci had every reason to be happy.
“We’ve stood the test in our games so far, and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Air deserves all the credit, they took better risks than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute Trey, who was converted by Fraser Climo, put Air in the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes released by the Warriors allowed Melrose to score points and Jason Baggott caught Trey not converted.
Climo raised Air's lead with a foul, before just in the half, he scored and then converted Trey Solo to 17-5 for Air in the half.
But Melrose opened the second half well and Patrick Engerson's freshman, who was converted by Begut, narrowed the gap to five points.
Thereafter there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Roderick Knut, who was taken away on a stretcher, and starting from the resumption of the game, Air widened the gap through Stafford McDowell's Trey, who was converted by Clemeau.
Air Blair McPherson's alternate captain was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of the other man with Bruce Colvin's unconvert Trey, ending a string of tremendous pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Strawn Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking Kalimo without a ball, from the penalty area, McPherson scored a touchdown behind Air’s forward.
Kalimo Hammer, as he did almost again from rematch, after Kyle Roy S kicked David Armstrong's boxing boot and sent Henry's wing to Tray's sixth home team.
Star Still Game Looks Ready for a New Restaurant Career
Still Game star Ford Kearnan appears to be ready to move into the restaurant industry after being identified as the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he writes and stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the final season of the show, and it appears that Kearnan is planning life after Krailing.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source suggested Kearnan was looking for ways to enter Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia with no sea hopes court will open path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the Navy headquarters wrapped in a La Paz ship cover.
Public buildings raise a blue-sea flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to reclaim it.”
Throughout Bolivia that has no access to the sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, is still alive - as is the longing to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be at their best for decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects from a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will sit on large screens across the country in the hope that the Court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia’s demand that, after decades of stalling talks, Chile be obliged to negotiate sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, Evo Morales, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, is hanging a lot on Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But commentators believe there is little chance that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and that even if it decides in its favor, it won’t make much difference.
The U.N. court sitting in The Hague has no authority to grant Chilean territory, and said it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court’s decision came only six weeks after the concluding arguments were heard suggests that the case was “not complicated,” but Paz Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia’s claims, the past four years may even have weakened them.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Zarata said.
Morales’s war rhetoric wiped out every remnant of goodwill on the part of Chile, she said.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodriguez Velez, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a "great opportunity to open a new era in relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 years of disputes for the benefit of both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime issue as a political lever.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Stop is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says denuclearization won't happen unless it can trust U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong said his country would never denuclearize first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His words come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reopening diplomatic talks on nuclear weapons that have reached a dead end more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was “a dream in the blink of an eye” to think that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance to declaring the end of the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
The United States is afraid to agree to the declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps to denuclearize.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear arsenal, which it likely sees as the only way to protect its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Show Reveals New Trend in Giant Hats Found on the Way to Luxury Stores Everywhere
The solution is for anyone who wants to expand their hat collection or get complete sun protection.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a row of huge and insane head coverings for their SS19 collection at a fashion show that overshadowed the Paris Fashion Week style scene.
Unpractical hats have conquered Instagram this summer, and these designers have brought their extraordinary creations to the course of fashion shows.
Valentino’s highlight was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with broad feather-like fringes that covered the models’ heads.
Other accessories of a disproportionate size included decorated watermelon, a magical hat and even a pineapple – but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of strange masks - check in on time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks included sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than Hut Kutour.
One piece mentioned a snorkeling mask and glasses, and another looked like a melting ice cream cone.
And those who want to continue with a huge fashion statement of dimensions - their time has come.
Fashion commentators predict that the giant hats are making their way to the luxurious stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after ‘La Bomba’, the half-meter-diameter straw hat seen on everyone’s head, from Mariana to Emily Rataikowski.
Label Calt behind the very impractical hat that overwhelmed social networks spawned another great piece on the track – a straw bag almost the size of the swimsuit model who carried it.
A burnt-written relaxation bag, with a relaxation strand and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacqueline Le Riviera’s SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m expecting big hats and big sea veterans to arrive in luxury stores next summer—because the design made a huge impression and it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized exquisites.”
John Edwards: Language Skills Essential for World Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, reinforced by personal and team success in sports, arts, music and other areas of community practice.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that is able to design and implement a customized curriculum, we find that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a desired field of study at school.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you talk to a man in his own language, it goes into his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of last year’s tests, you can see that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages scored a high A.
Data collected from the 74 schools members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved a high A in Mandarin, as did 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today the field of languages as an elective subject is considered at the same level as STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Council on Employment and Skills found that of the reasons employers cited Kodi for filling vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, increasingly, language skills become an essential requirement to prepare students for future careers.
Given the rising demands for languages for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in a world of globalization.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he or she has learned a second language, he or she will have a significant advantage in the future thanks to this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically stabilizes a person in an advantageous position over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit number of speakers, 15 percent.
That’s why it’s important to invest in teaching children languages today.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different as to the languages taught in it.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered most important for the UK in looking forward to the 20th century, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever the child’s field of interest, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with a team of teachers specializing in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, in any foreseeable future.
It cannot be denied today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, and therefore this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be viewed as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s children.
It's the order of the hour.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is expected to play for the Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans who have been waiting to see LeBron James play for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the pre-season game against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” the Lakers’ official website said.
Laker reporter Mike Trudle tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six pre-season games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to get ready,” he said.
Trump's rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts with a flurry of election rallies tonight in Welling, the Virginia system.
This is the first of five planned rallies by Trump this week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
As Trump votes to confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court, he aims to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Welling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. East Coast time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump rally in West Virginia can be watched live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over accusations of sexual misconduct and the postponement of a week’s vote in the Senate while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the main goal of this rallies stream is to help Republicans facing challenging elections in November gain some momentum.
Accordingly, President Trump’s campaign headquarters said the goal of these five rallies next week is to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president is willing to visit as many countries as possible as the crowded election season enters,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally, which is scheduled to take place at Wesbanko Stadium in Welling, could bring back supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania” and draw media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to try to improve his situation in the polls,” said Simon Hayder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Willingness to Struggle to Maintain Hope for Sunday’s Singles Games
After three one-sided sessions, Sunday afternoon quartet games may be just what the Ryder Cup needs.
The momentum propulsion pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this one.
So where do they think the momentum is now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so you can see a bit of momentum,” said Sephith at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, four points ahead with 12 more in the game.
But the Americans, as Spit says, feel that they have a little bit of spirit in their sails, and they have a lot to cheer on, not the last of them in the Spit form and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each of them boasts three points out of four.
Spitch was a killer from the Green T-Al and he is a leader with a personal example.
The shouts of joy intensified as his round continued, as he drowned Pat Critical to win the four-all-square game and Thomas dropped two by two.
His fate, which resulted in his 15-on win, won a similar outcry, the kind that shows he believes the American team still has hope.
“You really just have to dig deep and just worry about your own game,” Spit said.
That's all that's left for each of these players to do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
“The only players with more points from the end and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed lead story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but charming, duo of Europe are four out of four and are popular with all.
"Mollywood" was the only duo that didn't hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The same round, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic audience, establishes the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal the potential European victory with the sun set on the Le Golf National.
Better both at the same time in different holes.
It is still too early to speak of European fame.
Boba and Tucson Webb Simpson finished with Sergio Garcia, the hero of The Morning Four Balls, when he was matched with Alex Norén.
Bogey and two doubles in the front nine lowered the Spaniards and the Swedes to a hole they were not close to exiting.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you out of the pit.
It’s fascinating to take a closer look at the four balls and quads because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and the way strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and leads significantly towards the final day, but this quarter-final session showed that the American team was full of a fighting spirit that some, especially within the United States, questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 on final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in a healthy lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the four-ball and four-ball matches on Saturday with a 10-6 result against the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Vernesco Molinari led the change with two victories over struggling Tiger Woods, raising the gap so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, who tried to defend the trophy they lost at Hazeltin two years ago, dominated against the Americans who missed the four-ball games this morning, bringing the series to 3-1.
The American players showed more resistance in the quarter-finals, winning two games, but were unable to close the gap.
To continue to hold the Cup, Jim Forrick’s friends need eight points from the only 12 games.
Fleetwood is the first European tyrocan to win four points in a row, while he and Molinery, nicknamed “Molywood” after an exceptional weekend, are only the second duo to win four points from their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they continued in miraculous harmony to defeat weakened Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambou with an even more pronounced score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself over two games on Saturday, showed random bursts of excellence, but so far he has lost 19 of the 29 games of the four balls and fours, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during this morning’s four-ball matches, returned to join Henrik Stanson in the four-ball matches to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koupaka – ranked first and third in the world.
However, not everything went smoothly for the European players in the pleasant weather and the gentle wind blowing southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner, Jordan Sephith and Justin Thomas, set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a pressing 2 and 1 victory over John Ram of Spain and Ian Fowler in the four-ball matches and later returned to defeat Fletcher and Rory McCleary in the 4th and 3rd matches, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned from a negative four-point gap to individual matches, though as cup holders, Foric's people only need a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond their reach.
North Korea says 'under no circumstances' it will not disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday at the United Nations that continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under the circumstances.
At the annual United Nations General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho announced that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to no longer developing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any consistent response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure about our national defense and under such conditions we will not first unilaterally disarm ourselves of nuclear weapons.”
While he repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about the U.S.’s opposition to a “graded” approach to nuclear disarmament, whereby North Korea would be rewarded while taking gradual steps, his statement seems important in that it has not rejected nuclear disarmament on the brink, as North Korea has done in the past.
Referring to a joint declaration made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to protect North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also opposed calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and increases sanctions pressure to achieve its goal through coercion, and even opposes ‘declaring an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is a dream in the assemblage of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the escalating sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president stressed in a speech at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: “If the other side on the denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.”
However, Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that a U.S. missile attack by North Korea was inevitable after Mr. Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to denuclearize, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a specific timeframe for that, adding: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have said the U.N. Security Council should reward North Korea for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue with determination and unimpeded until we achieve complete and verified nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported the imposition of sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for its ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making “gangster demands.”
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear facility if the United States takes "consistent steps."
He said Kim had told him that the “coordinated steps” he wanted included security guarantees Trump had pledged in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the expanding macho culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
Academic research has found that students at the number one university in the world often have no clue as to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Casisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham <0x26> Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considered to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are they only telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Briera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to open the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One part shows a picture of a dorm room, where students press coffee mugs, curtains, sportswear and books – to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a sleep-walking routine.
In another section, participants are told how persistent sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students overnight.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” said Ziesler.
He said the culture of pride about “sleepless night success” still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are causing the problem of sleep deprivation to grow.
“Caring for adequate sleep and good sleep quality should be every student’s ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he said – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of starvation, so we’re hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Ziesler design the course after attending one of his first year classes at Harvard.
He said the course enlightened him and motivated him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar teaching program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Tsizel recommended that students look at the possibility of setting a clock that would ring when it was time to go to bed, not just when they had to wake up, and to be aware of the damaging effects of ‘blue light’ emitting electronic screens and LED lighting, which could disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause problems sleeping.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Manga goal decisive for Gerrard's players
The Rangers suffered another offensive loss in an off-road game when Dolly Manga caused Stephen Gerrard's rebel players to lose 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox players hoped to get their first win in a away game since February 1–4 at St John's, but Gary Holt's team only lost Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager, leaving the team eight points behind the rushing Harts at the top of the Scottish Premier League.
Manga attacked seven minutes before halftime and it didn’t look like the uninspired Rangers would match.
As the Rangers now plunge to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and immediately behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
Another Rangers double may be waiting after Callum Spence needed treatment for a head injury after an object was thrown at him from the gallery.
Gerrard made eight exchanges in the team that passed Air to the semi-finals in the Cup at Betterde.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with those 11 Livingston players who took a point from the Harts last week, and he could be satisfied with the way his players blocked opponents in any situation.
The Rangers may have controlled holding the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They almost scored in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Pettman who kicked Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder kicked the ball too far.
Keegan Jacob's deep free kick then found Captain Craig Hallect, but his defender Alan Lethgoy could only kick out of the beam.
The Rangers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have ruled a felony in his favor after a quarter-hour game, when he and Steven Lowell collided, but Judge Stephen Thompson waved against the Colombian player’s pleas.
The Rangers only managed to kick the goal twice in the first half, but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily blocked Lassana Kulivali's knockout and Obi-Wan's weak kick.
While Livingstone’s opening at the 34th minute was contrary to the game’s conduct, no one would deny that they deserved it at least for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs’ deep free ball.
Scott Artfield did not respond as Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool by transferring him to Manga for a simple finish.
Gerard did something in half when he replaced Colibly with Ryan Kent, and the exchange brought about an almost immediate impact when the wing/extremist inserted a ball into Morelos but Impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the guest team to play exactly the kind of game she liked, with Lethgoy and the picket continuing to send long balls.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor stood up well to prevent Jacobs' attempt before Leetguy slammed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton later had another offense against Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now to stand from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm „Hans“ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geyer developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as a Geiger Counter.
The device has since become a mainstay of science, but in 1950 it also became a mainstay of pop culture thanks to the film Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as two strange cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on the headphones, you can actually hear the effects of radioactivity on atoms in minerals.”
Owens: “Oh, man, it’s really buzzing now!”
Hans Geiger passed away in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on after him.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and eliminate them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, and changing the cells in the laboratory.
The cells can then “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and is then injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman who was treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the lab so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzoofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Betsada, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “induces the development of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West broke out in a reprimand speech in support of Trump, with his head in a maga hat, after his appearance at SNL.
It was not well received.
Kanye West responded with contempt in the studio during a confused performance on the Saturday Night Live show, praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he will run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, called "Ghost Town," during which he wore a Make America Great hat, he began a reprimand speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I talk to white people who say, ‘How can you love Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The episode of SNL began with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the reprimand was not broadcast on the show, the video was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to roll on West in the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had been criticized behind the scenes for the hat he was wearing.
“They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out on stage with that hat on your head.’
They attacked me!
Then they said I was in a dark place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, “You want to see the dark place?” saying, “He’s wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try to show love.”
His remarks were scorned at least twice by the audience, and SNL staff members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, and one of them told the paper: "The silence of the Abyss fell throughout the entire studio."
West joined the show as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West Mem fought when he performed the song I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not giving in to the crowd.”
But current presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just “who he is and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose not to reward (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) which I believe is an effort and propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“And we too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now “the entity that was once known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, had the name Snoop Lyon, and of course the renowned musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and later to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Belyashar.
The suspect is expected to appear before the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Star Keith Harrington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harinton is known for the role of Jon Snow, the swordsman of the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the Macho hero, saying that such roles on screen often convey to young children the message that they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thinks “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of venomous masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted he was “very troubled” about dealing with the issue.
“Personally I feel very upset right now — where were we wrong about masculinity?” he said.
“What are we teaching men in their growing age, from the point of view of the problem we are now witnessing?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity, due to the very masculine characters it portrays.
What comes from the inside and what is learned from the outside?
What do we learn from television, and on the street, that makes young children feel they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think that’s one of the biggest questions of our time – how do we change that?
Because there is no doubt that something went wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any sequel or derivative series of Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, saying that he had "finished with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Keith will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his bandit brother.
The actor recently discovered that he sees meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that ever happened as a result of Game of Thrones.
“I knew my wife in the series, so that’s how the series gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the courtyard of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have the disease, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been contracted as a result of sexual intercourse, which is a change compared to the past.
To date, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection as a result of sexual intercourse is a burning problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality ceased to be illegal in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are the result of the failure to use adequate safeguards in these sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has guaranteed universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her team leaked information about a Republican senator and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information about three U.S. senators on the senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic senator from Los Angeles said the allegations were being circulated by “extreme right-wing” websites and critics.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies,” Waters tweeted.
The information reportedly included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators asked Cavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was linked to Waters’s office and published the information about a member of Waters’ team, according to a Hill report.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and a total lie,” Waters added.
“My team member – whose identity and personal details were exposed and whose security was compromised as a result of these false and erroneous accusations – was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a total lie.”
Waters' announcement prompted criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament required of members of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t react with anger.
He can't respond defiantly.
He can't question the accuser's motives.
He has to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’s reaction to Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to defeat Waters in the midterm election, also tweeted his thoughts.
“Great if that’s the truth,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said her office had approached “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies” about these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered,” she continued, “and that they are prosecuted for all their destructive and dangerous acts against my teammates.”
Johnny English 3.0: A Weakened Spy Parody starring Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for meanings about Brexit in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem to fit into this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy parody – which began somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will an ironic self-slap on how worthless we are become the new export opportunity of our country?
In any case, the clumsy, open-eyed, rubber-faced Johnny English got another chance to mess things up—and his name symbolizes more than anything a broad comedy piece for film viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
He is of course the dumb English agent, who despite his strange pretense of slippery glamour looks a little bit like Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and plenty of this guy who contributes a single note to the charm of the fire chariots in the opening text of the 2012 Olympics in London.
It is also originally based on the mysterious international traveler played by Atkinson in the forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard, which leaves chaos behind.
There’s a nice one or two minutes in Johnny English’s latest edition.
I liked the part where Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propeller blades were ringing at times on his helmet.
Atkinson demonstrates his comic physical abilities, but humor feels strangely weakened and superfluous, especially since the "serious" type of spy movies like 007 and Mission: Impossible itself now include a comic component.
The humor feels like it’s appealing to children instead of adults, and for me, Johnny English’s insane, failed adventures are less brilliant and focused than the Mr. Bean’s mute-film jokes.
The story begins when a great danger threatens Britain.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the alarm of the main agent – a small role unfortunately for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for an arrogant, battle-ready prime minister who is already suffering from a complete breakdown of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best to play the role of Theresa May, but she has little to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is exposed, she will have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means the boastful Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a school principal at a prestigious institution, but gives unofficial lessons in how to be an undercover spy: a few good jokes here, when English offers a school-style academy for spying.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former assistant to the suffering mode Buff, who is played again by Ben Miller.
Boof is now a man married to a submarine command in the role of an annoying class queen on whom Vikko Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service get into a terrible mess are back in action, with a beautiful Pam-Fatal in the form of Ophelia Boltova played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems – the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey which is more of a clown farce: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on Volta's fancy yacht; and English ignites absolute anarchy in his attempt to use a virtual reality kit to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
No doubt all efforts are made to lead to the final sequence, but despite the kindness and playfulness, it has a sense of television for children.
Pretty mid-level.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan whereby the British will work four days a week – but will be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company managers to pass the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution on to employees in the form of an extra day of rest.
I mean, employees have a three-day weekend, and they still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea was “appropriate” for the company’s economic agenda and its plans to tip the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but this four-day work week is an aspiration suited to the Party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as to the Party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, with the Green Party calling for a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The Labour candidate for Finance Minister, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s party convention to formulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless executives” and “pricemakers” in service companies.
It also follows from the nominee’s plans that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full investment back because the Labour government may make ‘reductions’ based on detecting misconduct.
He also confirms that there are plans to bring employees to the boards of directors of companies and create ‘inclusive funds’ to transfer 10 percent of the capital of private sector companies to employees, which would put into their pockets annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John F. Kennedy told the TV show 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh would change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings could persuade any Republicans to withdraw their support.
In an idea aired on Sunday on 60 Minutes, Scott Flea asked Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said before the hearing, I said I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the accusation came up, and I said, ‘Did you do it?’
He was decisive, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, however, appears to be engraved on a rock.
“I’ve already decided about Burt Kavanaugh and there will be a need for an explosive accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Burt strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
“None of the men she mentioned could verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see how anything can change."
What is the World Citizens Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
Saturday’s New York City will host the Citizens of the World Festival, an annual music event with the most impressive list of stars to appear and an equally impressive goal of ending world poverty.
The Citizens of the World Festival, which is taking place for the seventh time, will bring tens of thousands of people to the big grass in Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event – to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to an event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP card), the concert host must complete a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a global leader, calling or other significant ways to help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has the festival really achieved, with only 12 years to go before it to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free ticket to a concert really a way to convince them to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of “clivism” — people who feel like they are really having an impact by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Citizens of the World says it has documented more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
These actions have helped incentivize world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already begun in distribution or fundraising.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” and promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Citizens of the World.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and ‘citizens of the world’ like you, we can make social justice about malnutrition a footnote in history,” Ambassador Tracy Allman told the audience at the London live concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on Britain to improve diets for mothers and children, the government announced a stipend for the project, Power of Nutrition, to reach 5 million women and children with dietary interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Citizens of the world,” she replied, “it will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monet are among some of the shows that will feature at this year’s event in New York, featuring Deborah-Lee Fornes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy for sea blockade to delay Russian energy exports
“If necessary,” Washington could use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink revealed, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zink claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – which is being made, it is important to mention, at the invitation of the legitimate government – would be an excuse to spread to new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, just like they are doing in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States, with our fleet, is able to make sure that the sea lanes are open and, when necessary, to place a blockade to make sure that their energy sources do not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were indeed the same.
“The economic possibility for Iran and Russia is more or less leverage and substitution of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration set out on a mission to boost its thickened natural gas exports to Europe, while replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to cancel its participation in the “unworthy” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is supposed to double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion square meters, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s firm opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position was met with a sharp backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organisation (BDI), the leading organisation in the German industrial sector, has called on the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempff, head of the German Industry Organisation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren ‘seriously considers’ running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “seriously consider” the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed her intention to run for president during a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken administration, and for that, it’s necessary for a woman to lead,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential race.”
Warren expressed her views on President Donald Trump during the city meeting, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren strongly criticized Trump over the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s voters themselves do not think she should run for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of the “potential” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run for election, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the senator's presidential bid.
The poll showed that there was more support for the run of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his run against 48 percent opposing it.
Popular Democratic figures who emerged in the context of a possible 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to AP reports.
Sarah Palin marks Trac Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old Trak Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s been going through since he came back, allows me to empathize with families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and with some of the trauma that our soldiers are returning,” she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans: "They come back a little differently, they come back stiffly, they come back wondering if what they gave to the country, their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other military men, is honored."
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Vesila, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, obstructing the reporting of the case of domestic violence and possession of a weapon intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vesila police.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and county filled out a “Friend of the Court” affidavit on Friday in Washington to support the challenge to asylum seekers’ policies, NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Rights Association in August, has not been disclosed.
She said her boyfriend and “violent sons, gang members” abused her but U.S. government officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s state attorneys described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum applications are filed in the United States, as nations facing many problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 resolution by the BIA Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented migrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Carl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal law requires all hearings on asylum applications to rely on the special facts and circumstances of the application, and the barrier set by the new policy violates this principle,” the statement reads.
The lawyers also argued in the deposition that the policy, which prevents immigrants from entering, harms the U.S. economy because they tend to become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary work,” they said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“Political asylum is open to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo, as the death toll doubles, in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become more and more difficult.
“There’s a very tense feeling,” said Risa Kosuma, 35, the mother of a fever-induced baby in the center of evacuation in the ruined city of Palo.
“An ambulance is bringing bodies at any moment.
“Clean water is scarce.”
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, hovering among water-sponge objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Devi Harris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, lay outside the Palo Military Hospital, where they were treated for severe aftershocks that continued after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the wreckage of the wall, I think,” Harris told AP, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they’re in a safe place.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily, aggressively promoting the benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid supplement by the Chinese newspaper China Daily in the Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, The Des Moines Register, after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, claiming that China had rejected it.
Trump’s accusation that China tried to interfere in the US election marked a new stage, according to U.S. officials, in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to publish trade promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in a burgeoning trade war in which each country raises and compares customs rates on products imported from its rival.
The tariffs, which China raised as retaliation at an early stage of the trade war, were meant to hit exporters from countries like Iowa who backed Trump’s Republican Party, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Bernstadt, the U.S. ambassador to China, a former governor of Iowa for many years and an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Bernstad wrote in an op-ed in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “strengthens bullying by advertising in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s precious tradition of freedom of speech and the press, and is posting a paid ad in the Da Moyne Register,” Barnstad wrote.
“On the other hand, on the newsstand in the streets of Beijing, you will find few opposing voices and you will not see any real reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic path, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers evaded the proposal to publish” his article, though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republican Party Removes Women's Votes Before Midterm Elections With Kavanaugh Incident, Analysts Warn
While many Republican party leaders have stood by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defended him against multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the next midterm elections.
Feelings around the matter were especially lively, and most Republicans are officially demonstrating their desire to move forward in the voting process.
“Such things cannot be reversed,” Grant Riehr, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Rieher said he doubted that last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (from the Republican Party in Arizona) to open an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday — they are not going to forget it tomorrow, not November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman to the progressive movement MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted, “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate Hall, as the Republicans in control of the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue promoting Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The levels of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break new records,” said Stu Rottenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say they were already tall; they’re right.
But they can be higher, especially among the floating voices of women in the suburbs and among young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their lack of sympathy for the president, often refrain from voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidate, analysts said there could be a counter-reaction if Republicans continued to push for confirmation.
“The appointment has caused Republicans serious trouble,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets the nomination, it’s also about how Republicans handled it and how they dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat at odds with the extent of their belief in Namura in the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed for sure or most likely Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed for sure or most likely Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied for sure or probably during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations raised by Ford as well as those raised by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to reports in The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed Avermene to her during a party they attended during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start a New Web to Beat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the legendary man in the tech world, is a company that will develop Solid, Berners-Lee’s open source platform.
The Solid platform allows its users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be allowed to access the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning behind Inrupt is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create a “personal online database” or POD.
The database can include a list of contacts, lists of actions to perform, a schedule, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser at the same time.
What distinguishes the personal online database is that only the user can decide who can access the information and what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, Inrupt will find the right resources, process, and capabilities to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team that includes several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create distributed apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not discussing with Facebook and Google whether or not they would agree to a complete change that would cause a complete overnight reversal of all their business models.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission “is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network being built in Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he founded the network’s standard organization, W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m particularly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard van: An event to commemorate the cleric who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only cleric from the Church of England to have won, as a warrior, the Victoria Cross during World War I was noted at an event held in his hometown, 100 years after the victory.
Lieutenant General and Reverend Bernard van, won the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never known to have won the highest British honour.
The commemorative stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rasden, North Hampton County, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that exposing the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award was “remarkably symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his battalion and crossed the Saint-Kanten Canal "through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
He then rushed to the line of fire and "the greatest of gallantry" led the line forward before he rushed to take control of a submachine gun with one hand and toppled three of the company.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never compare to but something that humbles me.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Royal Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael van said he was “very honored to be part of the parade” and added: “The heroism of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people.”
Mixed Martial Arts fans stayed up all night to watch Blator 206, and instead received Pepe Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch the action of Ballet 206 and eventually being denied the main event.
The San Jose show consisted of 13 fights, including six on the main ticket, and was broadcast live during the night on British Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Jaguar Moussassi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for battle, British viewers were stunned as the coverage changed to Pepe Pig.
Some were not impressed by the change after staying up until especially early in the morning to watch the fight.
One fan described the move to the children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
“This is a government regulation that states that at 6 a.m. the original content was inappropriate and therefore they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Blator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pappa Pig, yes."
Blator's president, Scott Cocker, said they plan to work on their schedules to include future British viewers.
“I think when I think about the rerun, I think we can probably solve it,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday there and we won’t be able to solve the problem until Sunday in our time zone, that is, Monday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition, a lot of text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time it's not going to happen.
"We're only going to have five fights instead of six - as we usually do - we tried to give the fans more and we just overreacted.
It’s a matter of unlucky.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley ‘sentied’ because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, the Olympic water jumper, said that as a teenager he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation – but that feeling motivated him to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn’t know until he got to middle school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the old show, Kristy Young, has been on sick leave for several months.
In his appearance as Laverne's first show star, Daley said he felt inferior to the others as he grew up because "it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, “To this day, the feeling of inferiority, the feeling of difference, were real things that gave me strength and power and allowed me to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out what his sexual orientation was.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-connected leader of the LGBT community campaign and has used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on other countries to legalize homosexuality.
He was open about the subject because he felt lucky to have been given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple winner of the World Series said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “caught me by surprise.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age gap was never a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” – he attended the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his "every point of view" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I should win a gold medal’,” he said.
“You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you wouldn’t be here to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand while his breathing stopped and only when he really stopped breathing and died did I finally recognize that he was not invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that’s what I’ve been dreaming about my whole life — diving in front of my home audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
This is also what inspired him to choose his first song – Heather Small’s Proud – with which he identified during the preparations for the Olympics and which still makes him goose-skinned.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 PM British Summer Time.
Michaelson disappointed in performance and went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Mikaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he will need to upgrade performance so that the event does not become a miserable milestone.
Mikaelson, who participates in the 12th bi-annual event and sets a record, descended on the bench at the decision of Jim Fiorik during Saturday’s four-ball and four-ball matches.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it used to be in games with the United States, Mikaelson, who won five majors, spent half of the day as a cheerleader and the other half working on his game on the sidelines in hopes of fixing the ill he suffered.
Even at the height of his career, the actor’s performance suffered from rebellions and ups and downs. Therefore, the 48-year-old Mikaelson is not the ideal choice for La Golf National, where the long grass tracks are usually not forgiving to stray punches.
And if the competition itself isn’t deterrent enough, Mikaelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, competed against the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with starter Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the ambition of the Americans, who lost four points in the first 12 games, was to succeed in the first stages, Michaelson's game could have been overwhelming.
Furick expressed confidence in his player, although we didn’t expect him to say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He was a member of the Hall of Fame and added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that’s how it evolved and that’s how we thought we should continue.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players.”
Mikaelson will break Nick Paldo’s record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may end his career in the Ryder Cup, which never really matched his personal peaks.
Mikaelson is credited with 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, though Fiorik said his presence added some intangible advantages to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and it’s fun to be in the locker room with him,” he said.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see that.
It goes far beyond the game itself.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big advantage may soon be gone
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day in the Ryder Cup's individual games could change for the worse.
The Danish player started his way into a game at Valderrama in 1997, when his playmate, Grandpa Blastros, had a 5-point advantage over the Americans, which he almost lost by crossing the finish line with a minimal advantage and winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I keep reminding myself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; that we had a big advantage in a game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with a small advantage,” Bjorn said in the photo, after watching a 5-3 win in the 2018 tournament both on Friday and yesterday, which led to a 10-6 lead in La Golf National.
“Then history will prove to me and to everyone on the team that this is not over.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
You have to get on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, trying to win the trophy, and we need to focus on it.
I said all along, I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of those who are facing us on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn was pleased with the performance of his players on the hard golf course and added: “It’s important for me never to get ahead of myself when it comes to golf.
Tomorrow could be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and it's completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything's going well, but when you're there alone, then your full ability as a golfer is tested.
And this is the message to the players: you have to make the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to make the best of himself.”
In contrast to Bjorn, rival team captain Jim Fiorik would expect better personal performance from his players, compared to their performance in the matches, except for Jordan Sephith and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fiorik himself knows both the winning side and the losing side, during the important days of the finals of this type of tournaments, having participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, when the European team miraculously won the final game, as documented in the film Miracle at Medinah.
“I remember every word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had encouraged his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to be successful in the early stages, like you saw in Brooklyn, and like you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield games.
“We’re putting our team together accordingly and putting the guys on track based on the feeling we have, you know, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and he will face Rory McElroy in the summit game, with Paul Cassey, Justin Rose, John Ramm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Fowler, who are the rest of the top-half Europeans.
“I chose the team in this order because I think it will get us to the end,” Bjorn said, referring to his individual selection.
Germany's new warship was once again rejected.
Germany’s new fleet frigate was supposed to be accepted in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War period, but was delayed for at least a year due to faulty systems and reduced cost, local media reported.
The reception of Rheinland-Pfalz, the ship leading the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate line, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report by the daily De Tsitte citing a military spokesman.
The cruise ships were supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but worrisome issues after the supply closed the door on the ambitious project.
All four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class cruises, ordered by the Navy back in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to include powerful guns, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries, as well as stealth technologies, such as acoustic, infrared, and reduced radar signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, repeated delays mean that the innovative ships – which are supposed to allow Germany to send troops overseas – will be obsolete by the time they enter service.
The F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had a ship built after its delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship useless for combat missions.
The deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class navy will be operated by about 120 sailors – about half of the crew used in the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have dramatic overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, and is twice as heavy as the similar type of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty software, the price tag of the entire project – which also includes staff training – also becomes a problem.
It is rumored to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s security committee, confirmed that the navy now has “a shortage of ships capable of deploying.”
The official source said the problem had intensified over time, as older ships had been decommissioned but not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed his regret that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could be attached to the Navy.
The National Foundation of Scotland Listens to The Secret Life of Bats
A new study at a mansion in the mountains of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for their food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland, will track common bats and European phones, as well as brown, long-eared Dubenton bats in Invero Gardens in Worcester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
A specialized sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequencies of bat calls and which of the species is responsible for them.
Next, a map of the habitats will be drawn to create a detailed picture on the scale of the landscape, of their behavior patterns.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the National Foundation of Scotland (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which areas of life are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of the livelihood management work, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
They are under threat from development and construction works, which affect nesting and the loss of living areas.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, and the same is true for fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, bat ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo detection technique to locate insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has 10 skilled specialists, who regularly carry out surveys, nesting tests and sometimes rescue.
The organization also set up the first and only bat reserve at T'Rib Manor in Dumpries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Mansion manager David Thompson said the mansion was the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Tehriv we have a great area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right living areas.
But many things are still unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of testing the bats before carrying out maintenance work inside the properties, as the unintended destruction of a single inhabited nest could destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and could destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected species and killing, harassing, and disturbing bats or destroying their nest areas are prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish clerk at the Bat Conservation Foundation, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said: "We have a lot more to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo drops rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him “Fake News” and said people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Katherine Murga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was later alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo approached his 142 million Instagram followers on live video a few hours after the allegations were made public and scornfully called the reports “Fake News.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News,” he told the camera the actor who won the D'Or balloon five times.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is good,” the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Dr. Spiegel for the charges, which they referred to as "an unacceptable report of privacy suspicions," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the actor would seek compensation for “restraint damages in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Murga reportedly returned to the actor's room and the actor allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Murga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was a “good guy” at “99 percent” that he had failed at “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they were consensual.
Murga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “terrified by reprisals” and feared “being humiliated in public.”
The 34-year-old says she is now interested in reversing the arrangement because she is still suffering from trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and passed the summer to Italian club Juventus in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' loss of automakers
Britain will forever regret losing its position as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, UK Commerce Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that the BBC’s Toyota UK interview, in which it said that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Princeton, near Derby, was “worrying.”
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays in the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Branston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Oris and Avantis models, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“In my view, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will see a production shutdown at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, chief executive of Toyota in Princeton.
More UK carmakers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its ‘mini’ factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers call ‘supply chain risks’ in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from British suppliers and from the rest of the EU, to make cars on demand.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, the border could be disrupted, and industry officials say it could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota will not be able to hold a stock worth more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production will be halted.
Clarke said Theresa May’s “Checkers” program, which details Britain’s future relationship with the EU, is “precisely calibrated to prevent these tests at the border.”
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement, as I said, not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to seize the opportunity,” he said on Today on BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence from Toyota and other automakers is that the possibility of continuing to use the successful supply chain system that we have had to date is absolutely essential.”
Toyota did not say how long the shutdown would last, but in the longer term, it warned that the additional costs would hurt the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to layoffs.
Peter Tsubalaris, who has worked in Branston for 24 years and serves as president of Unite at the factory, said that union members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if jobs are reduced, they will never be restored.
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, many of which depend on him, could be “delayed by another week” as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The gossip in Washington has dealt for months with whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general and jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying a wire to record conversations with Trump and cause the president’s impeachment through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he arrived at the White House and was reportedly about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was staying at the time of Rosenstein’s arrival at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was postponed to avoid collision with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week into the allegations against Kavanaugh, and again rejected the Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date has not yet been set for the meeting, it may take place this week, I can see a postponement of another week given what is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always happy to update the press.”
Some reporters will challenge this assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rareness of the briefings was not due to a dislike of the TV reporters’ “take of the stand,” although she said: “I will not deny the fact that they are taking a stand.”
She then suggested stepping up direct ties between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more questions-and-answer meetings than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We checked the numbers.”
“The press briefings will still take place,” Sanders said, “but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
“We have tried to do this on many occasions, and you have seen that we have done so on many occasions in the last few weeks, and meetings that will allow us to speak with the President of the United States will replace press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press conferences during dignitary visits.
His press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated the reason for this, in a loose and sometimes odd performance to reporters gathered at the scene.
Health Minister writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland and addresses Brexit concerns
The Health Minister wrote to staff from the European Union, employed by the National Health Service of Scotland, to express the country’s gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish Member of Parliament Jean Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already pledged to take ownership of applications for permanent status for EU citizens working in its distributed public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the exit have continued, and he is moving towards the decisions expected in the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this period can be very worrisome for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the team, regardless of their citizenship.
Fellows from across the EU and around the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
University of Tennessee's back defender, Christian Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury from Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt University Commodore team, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
University of Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
“He went to the sidelines and just collapsed there,” Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercombe oxygen on the side of the field and then put him on a stretcher and took him for further examination.
A University of Tennessee clerk told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been transferred for surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/scope of the surgery" and the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the impact occurred.
Abercrombie is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He participated in a total of five rebounds before leaving the game, raising his total rebounds this season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and the additional revenue will be used to help homeless people, according to the new Conservative plan.
Corbyn's move to attract new voters
The stamp duty will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects the tax to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp duty when buying a property in the UK - the extra income will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move appears to be an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high-income earners.
The stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the increase in revenue will strengthen the government’s move to help those who are sleeping under difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes in addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on secondary housing and real estate investments for leasing, could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new property being built in London is purchased by foreign residents, a situation that causes prices to rise and makes it difficult for people who first buy property to set foot on the housing scale.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially the capital – have become “ghost towns” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help young people buy a first home.
He blamed large construction companies for the price of expensive properties, as they hijack land but do not use it, and urged Mrs. May to abandon the quotas on affordable homes and fix Britain’s “housing aggravation.”
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including the supervision of rent and the cessation of “no-fault” evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
“Last year I said I would devote my term to restoring the British dream – which is that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based in foreign countries, can buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
The dream of becoming a homeowner has become too far away for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping in difficult conditions is too realistic.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his “ultimate ambition” was to become a manager of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the resuscitation challenge of Northeast, currently in third place in the Premier League, three points from the top.
He moved to Light Stadium this summer after leading St. Mirren back to No. 1 in Scotland last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was at an international game once and that’s it,” Ross told the BBC’s Sportsound.
But growing up, I watched Scotland play Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that pulled me back.
“This opportunity will only come if I manage the team.”
Sunderland's previous directors include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Foyet, and Paulo di Canoe.
The former manager of Aloe Athletic says he was not afraid to come after such well-established names at such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success right now will be measured by ‘Can I bring the club back to Premier League?’
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that it belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross began his management career only three years ago, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumberton and 15 months as a team coach for the Hearts team.
Next, he helped Aloah out of the third league and raised St. Mirren from the precipice to championship status the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his acting career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkirk, St. Myrrh and Hamilton Academy.
“It must have been a real junction,” he recalls, about taking command of Aloe.
“I really believed that the management position was better for me than the game.
It sounded odd because I played well, I gained reasonably, and I enjoyed some reasonable records.
A player’s career can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still deal with you when it comes to stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it, and I’ve never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.”

The perfect time for a pint of beer is at 17:30 on Saturday, found in the survey
The summer heatwave boosted the profits of British pubs struggling for their existence, but put pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars enjoyed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, the data revealed.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who compiled the data, said: “The significance of the continued clear weather and the longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Championships is that July had a similar pattern to June, with pub revenues rising 2.8 percent, but restaurants suffering an even more severe blow.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade observed in June only worsened in July.
Drink-focused pubs and bars recorded the strongest performance, with higher growth than the drop in revenue in the restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their condition was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent over the month, and food sales fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s company for data analysis in the field of leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important sporting or social events are the most important factors when it comes to the outdoors market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year would be particularly painful in addition to all the constant half-costs.
“The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring about what they need so badly.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.

One in five children have social media accounts they hide from their parents
A survey revealed that one in five children, some of them just 11 years old, have secret social media accounts they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed an increase in fake insta pages.
The news has heightened concerns about sexual content advertising
20% of students say they have a “head” account that they show parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates social media accounts that he keeps secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts – a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened concerns about the advertising of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they run a clean “head” account to show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found that she was asking others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC Association of Independent Schools in the UK, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admit to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eyalid Doyle will serve as a “voice for athletes” on the board of Scottish athletes
Aylid Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletes as an external director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated lightweight athlete and chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from its rich international experience over the past decade.
“Eyalid has been highly respected by the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit immensely from being brought to the board,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I am excited to be a voice for athletes and hope to be able to contribute and really help guide sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals in total, and now regularly serves as a commentator on the BBC, lost his ability to walk after suffering a passing stroke.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I recover or to what extent.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, re-learned how to walk and now performs agility and responsiveness exercises!
“Thank you for the encouragement!”
An ad for milk pumps that compares mothers with cows of an opinion party online
A dairy pump company has divided opinions online with an ad that compares lactating mothers to cow’s milk.
To mark the launch of the pump, which is supposed to be the world’s first wearable silent milk pump, technology company Elvie released a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom of action that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay to the sound of a song that included words like “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see a tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s not my nipples, it’s my breasts.”
The song continues: “Sucking, sucking, I feed the babies, sucking, sucking, I milk my girls.”
But the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy on the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of responses, the video received mixed responses from viewers, and many said it sheds light on the "atrocities" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days of giving birth.
Elvie’s milk pump fits discreetly into the breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another response said: “Comprehensibly traumatic for the cow and the calf alike.
But hey, why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?”
Another commented: “Advertising is completely disconnected.”
Others defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was “laughable.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The suction made me feel just like a cow.
The ad was a little crazy, but I was referring to its contents.
“It’s a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny ad for moms who suck (often at their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that they all danced with the discreet pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who use a milk pump say they feel like cows.
But Elvie’s pump is completely quiet, without pipes and wires, it fits discreetly into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Anna Bellarine, partner and in charge of the early childhood development department at Mother, said: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In making the comparison between women who express themselves and milking cows, we wanted to put the milk pump and all its challenges in the spotlight, and demonstrate in an entertaining, empathetic way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the track for designer Martha Jacobowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children in detention has risen despite the fact that the number of monthly crossings remains relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration’s discourse and policy made it difficult to transfer the children to sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that their ability to stay in the country would be jeopardized by applying for child custody.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would have to provide fingerprints, which would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified to Congress that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor minors without supervision.
The PA later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal history.
Nearly 80 percent of their sponsors or household members are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That’s why we continue to chase these people,” Mr. Albans said.
In order to address solutions for the children more quickly, officials introduced new laws that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, rather than after 60 days as per previous regulations, the shelter staff reported.
Many will appear via videoconference, rather than face-to-face, to present their claims for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those not found eligible for release will be deported quickly.
The longer these children remain in foster care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, shelter workers and reports published by the system in recent months said.
Consultants say these concerns are heightened at larger facilities such as Tornello, where signs of a child’s difficulties are likely to be neglected due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving the children to a city without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to break up with friends could worsen the trauma many are already facing.
Syria tells American, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moalem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext that they were fighting terrorism and would be “taken care of accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the rally.
Mualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we cleared the Syrian lands” from terrorist organizations and “any illegal foreign presence” alike.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 warriors on war-torn land.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions for their return were good and accused “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that moved refugees to stay away.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help their return,” he said.
They are politicizing an issue that should only be humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned they will not send aid to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel outpost, has created an opportunity to advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Syrian forces, backed by the Russians, into the province, home to three million people.
However, Moalem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action would focus on jihadist fighters, including fighters from the victory front linked to al-Qaeda, who were “destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee, made up of government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moalem set conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the panel’s work should be limited to “examining the provisions of the current constitution,” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberals expect, impeachment and scandal end his presidency ahead of time.
It will undoubtedly be the most dramatic finale in the history of the presidency of all time!
Currently, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, peak viewing times have more than doubled to reach 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled themselves to 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in peak hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show” has reached the top of the cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
“It’s the fire people are attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neil Barr, executive producer of the ABC drama series The Designated Survivor, which deals with a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scoville, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Only the Funny Parts: ...and Some Hard Truths About Infiltration into the Hollywood Men's Circle" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scoville told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike all other television shows, the plotlines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Changing a channel or ignoring it is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go beyond being an intelligent citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward’s “secret informant” as the source of Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket, Paul Manafort.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does, which feels like a reality show, is that he feeds you something every night,” said Brett Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show, “History for Sale,” about the team at Trump’s show and the daily twists in the plot (the war with the NFL, praised Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to lose one chapter or be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of Kaohai Island, but he shut down to watch MSNBC, recording CNN at the same time.
He could not break up, not when Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember the times when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Funds from external sources flood the race for the closest midterm elections to Congress
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district faces a flood of funds, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which resulted in a two-member race for the same seat.
The district, a suburb of Pittsburgh whose borders were recently redrawn, put Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won a seat in another district, in a special election last spring.
Lamb ran against another congressman, Republican Keith Ruthfuss, who now represents the 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the boundaries of the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the division of the former counties misjudged, and contrary to the constitution, the results in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a battle of financial blows in the election campaign between major party financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat belonged to Republicans for more than a decade, and President Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political commentators expected a slight advantage for Democrats.
The U.S. considers punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then withdraws.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already met in Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his associates expelled Trump’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to “the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan further,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, could have hurt a Central American country suffering from high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America rejected an urgent conference that was supposed to focus on safety and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from arriving in the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials made clear their desire to promote the conference, ending all punitive considerations against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now supposed to address attendees of the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance the administration attaches to him, diplomats said.
And three American emissaries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal discussions, provided they remained anonymous.
Their explanations were confirmed by an outside analyst, close to the administration, who also spoke anonymously.
Learning History
The next obvious thing could come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on alleged obstruction of justice by Trump, for which there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mueller is reportedly directing his investigation to the question of whether the Trump campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on our campaign.
If congressional control changes, Trump will find himself accountable to this body, just as he prepares to face voters again, and possibly a jury.
There are a lot of questions that start with “if” and I don’t intend to argue that Trump’s downfall is inevitable – not even for his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the struggle may last.
In 1938, German officers would have been prepared to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West had resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the resulting years of slaughter.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such tipping points.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculated about his inadequacy for the presidency.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair — or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?”
Above all, should we vote in the midterm elections and appoint a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will fall into a long winter nap.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which had also occupied my luxurious home in the past.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light Shabbat candles on the same table carrying the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Durance of the Rangers Optimist for the Vienna Rapid Debate
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Team G in the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durance from appearing for the first time in the season until his 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a leap for better performance.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old footballer said.
We went out into the game believing we could get something and got a point.
We might have won in the end, but overall, a tie was probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half and we were out of the freeze in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday is going to be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I’m convinced we can push and get a positive result.
“The past year has been really tough, with everything that’s happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but there’s a good feeling about the place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed.
Women stay awake because of this fear about pension savings
Despite the fact that respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the nationwide respondents said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to have the conversation,” said Holly Schneider, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
You can do it the following way.
Talk to your partner and your children: You will not be able to prepare your family for the treatment unless you express your wishes well in advance.
Use your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Share with your financial advisor: the advisor can also help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Your funding options for long-term nursing care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with an amount of money to help cover your expenses, or self-insurance with your capital – as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: find an early solution to legal disputes at this opportunity.
Find and appoint a health representative, a trustworthy person who will supervise your medical care and make sure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also consider signing a power of attorney when it comes to your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure bills are paid if you are not qualified.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“The financial side is not the only important point, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare the plan.”

A man was shot several times with air saturated while walking home from a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfercombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 p.m. on British Summer Time, as a “random act.”
The victim didn't see the man who attacked him.
The injuries he suffers are not life-threatening and police are looking for eyewitnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu, official sources said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disaster cut off communications networks and officials in charge of the aid could not get information from Dongala County, a region north of Palu that was closer to the source of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dungala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the ‘Center of Sulawesi’ province, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017, according to estimates.
The city marked its 40th anniversary when the tsunami and earthquake hit it.
Dongala is a province stretching over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the province, an administrative area within the province, was estimated at 299,200 people in 2017.
The main sources of income in the economy of the Province of Sulawesi are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Another important source of income is nickel mining, which is mainly concentrated in Murwali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dungala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dungala.
A tsunami also hit western Dungala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire region, known for its seismic activity and is permanently affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, on December 26, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of those killed died in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 hit South Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that shattered on the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 hit an area near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 hit one of the Mantawi islands, opposite Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pedy Jaya province in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as locals were reminded of the devastation that followed the quake and deadly tsunami of 2004.
The earthquake did not cause a tsunami in this case, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, Alaska’s governor and former vice president, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from the Alaskan city of Vesila, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held at the Matsuo Partial facility under a $500 self-guarantee, according to a report by the TV channel KTUU.
According to the network, he appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself “absolutely not guilty” when asked to plead his case.
Palin has been charged with three Type A offences and could be jailed for a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a B-type misconduct that could result in a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime of domestic violence, and possession of weapons under intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the loss rate is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos, distributed on social media, show the moment of the injury.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami blew up on the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York City are seeking the death penalty for Sibulo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, and hit pedestrians and a cyclist on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Sipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the Statement of Intent for the Death Penalty Application filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty can be demanded for these two charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury slapped Sipov with an indictment of 22 counts, including eight counts of racketeering-assisted murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “meaningful planning in advance and on purpose,” prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried out the attack as “lowly, cruel and sick.”
“Sipolo Javilovich Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Claves, Ann-Laure Decked, Darren Drake, Ariel Earlig, Hernán Frocci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Fanioco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York filed a death penalty lawsuit was a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was enforced in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Uzbek-born Saipov did not express any feelings of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about his actions, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired by the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also asked to hang an ISIS flag in the hospital room where he was staying.
He claimed to be innocent in response to the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were “of course disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea that would lead to life in prison with no possibility of release would only extend the traumatic duration of these events to all those involved,” Patton said.

Conservative MP Says Nigel Prague Should Be In Charge of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Prague vowed to “mobilize the People’s Army” today during a protest at the Conservative Convention.
The former leader of the UKIP party said politicians must “feel pressure” from the aeroscopic – when a member of parliament from Theresa May’s Conservative Party claimed he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a march in Birmingham that Britain “would already be out” at this point if Prague were to serve as Brexit secretary.
But May’s challenge, appeasing the deeply divided ranks of conservatives, has been highlighted by the joining of conservatives who support remaining in the EU to a different demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her compromise plan, the Chakras, on its way despite attacks from Brexiteers, Brexiteers and the European Union.
The Allies insisted that it continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the counter-reactions, forcing the Aerosceptic and Labour parties to choose between their agreement and chaos.
Boone said at a Leave Means Leave group meeting in Solihull that he wanted to say goodbye to Chuckers.
He argued that Prague should have been accepted as a member and should have been in charge of the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit but we need to say goodbye to Shakers.
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: “We did not fight in two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Boone dismissed the claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative MP and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also on the march and told reporters: “I’m simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chakras show is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who took to the streets and elected us in the first place.
“Please drop the chakras and start listening.”
In a critical statement to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Prague said at the conference that politicians should be made to “feel the pressure” if they are going to betray a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them, ‘We will not let you get away with it.’
He added, in a message to an enthusiastic audience: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressured.
“We call on the people’s army of this country, which gave us the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
At that moment, supporters of the stay marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved “Conservatives vs. Brexit” posters after the group’s formation over the weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the opening of the Conservative Conference over the security problems they suffered with the party app.
“These are people who are telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology possible for a deal like Canada plus plus, for frictionless border crossing and borderless free trade in Ireland,” he added.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9A>This is completely ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a “good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘seriously consider’ running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke out about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for the November midterms against Republican Jeff Dill, who served as co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
She was at the center of rumors that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke, which took place on Saturday afternoon, is the 36th meeting with voters in the city hall format since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was running for president.
Warren replied, “It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken administration and for a woman to lead.”
Arrest in the Simms shooting death case from the LSU
Police in the Louisiana capital, Baton Rouge, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wade Simms was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a person seen in the footage.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot and killed near the Southwestern University campus early on Friday.
“Wade Simms suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died of it,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wade tried to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene with a gun and singing at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the Baton Rouge East District Police.
The junior, who is almost two meters tall, has played 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton finishes world title after team rankings gave him a win over Sebastian Votel
It was clear, from the moment Walter Bottas advanced to the next stage ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the Mercedes divisions would play an important role in the race.
Bottas had a good start and he left Hamilton almost alone defending his place in the first two rounds and inviting Wattle to attack his teammate.
Votel went to the middle ground first, allowing Hamilton to be integrated into the movement in the tail of the competition, an apparently decisive decision.
The Mercedes team went for a round stop later and returned to the race behind Votel, but Hamilton moved forward after a close wheelbattle in which the Ferrari driver had to leave the inner lane to hold on without risk after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started on the back row of the rankings and was ranked seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led for a large part of the race and did not change tires to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimmie Raikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually dropped to a mid-run in the 44th round and was unable to step up the pace in the remaining eight rounds when Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Walteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me bypass him.
The team did an extraordinary job to get to Double,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a conference on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “bad and despicable and liars.”
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and despicable and lying,” he said.
“When you look at advertisements and leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document—“Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak," he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked earlier in September — but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s charges, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it secret and I kept the letter secret as she asked me.”
But the senator’s denial does not seem to have been accepted by the president, who responded to it during the conference on Saturday night: “I’m telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe it’s not [the leak], but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, claiming that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return to power at all costs.
You see the convicts, the villains, they don’t care who they hurt, who they run over on the way to power,” the president said, according to a media report.
Dandy stars 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee stars made up for their loss in the Premier League on Friday against the Belfast Giants and won the next game 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead from two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bevillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney put their team back on track until Dwyer brought the Giants back on track.
Bouchard tied for the Dandies until two of Lucas's goals for Nielsen secured the victory.
This is the third loss in a season for Adam Keefe, who came out behind to beat the Danes 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McPowell's cooking, and David Rutherford cooked Bevillier's goal by doubling the score four minutes later.
In the first full third, Sullivan put the home team back into play at 13:10 until Matt Marquardt cooked Cooney's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead on the first break when he scored his second goal in the evening, at the end of the first trimester.
The home team was re-evaluated and Bouchard scored again a goal that compared the power game at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give a lead to the Danes for the first time in the game, at the end of the second trimester, and Nielsen secured the Danes’ victory with the fifth goal, scoring half of the field in the last trimester.
The giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in their home court on Friday.
An air traffic controller has sacrificed his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane can escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian aviation inspector has been crowned a hero after sacrificing his life to ensure a plane with hundreds of passengers takes off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a strong earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Strong sub-shocks continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that many of his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Ganawan Agung refused to abandon his position at the tightly rocking control tower at Mutiara Sis al Joffrey airport in Palo.
He stayed in place to ensure that Battic Air Flight 6321 could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower thinking he was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air India, Johannes Siright, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news outlet ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from the airport in Alicante to take it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palo.
“Our hearts are broken at the hearing of the Gospel,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands because, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, access to Dongala, Sigi and Botong is limited.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and access to many others is impossible,” agency spokesman Satopo Porvoo said.
Waves up to six meters high destroyed Palu and the city will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and equipment.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are bringing bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working quickly to help survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the soldiers: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea says one person missing after plane crash in Laguna
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, having previously announced that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to say what had happened to one passenger.
The airline said it was working with authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and other crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that all remain in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in Laguna a short distance from the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Gaines said the plane had reached a very low orbit.
“This is a very positive thing,” said Janes.
Janes said he and the others were able to make their way to the emergency exits at the waist level of the sinking plane.
He said the plane crew panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve a dock also helped with rescue operations, using an inflatable boat that brought people ashore before the plane sank in water about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Data from the Air Safety Network (ASN) states that 111 people have been killed in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but Air New Guinea was not involved in any of these incidents.
Analyst details the course of events on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution proved its case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to connect the defendant’s movements, 29-year-old Quinton Tallis, and the movements of the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night of her murder.
According to the Clarion Ledger report, Rowlett said he received the location data from a number of mobile phones that showed that Tallis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the plaintiffs asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he “lied because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records say they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers’ death, Tallis deleted Chambers’ text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday, as planned.
The judge said he expects the trial to be moved to a jury hearing later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre and fills its music with positive messages.
The Bristol High Breed trio argues that hip-hop has moved away from its sources as a tool for expressing political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as the Fugiz and Commune have recently been revived in the UK by artists such as Akala and Laoki.
Another black man?
New York therapist sues couple for dismissal after text message ‘racist’
A New York therapist is suing a couple for dismissal on grounds of discrimination after receiving a text message that was not intended for her from the mother who complained that the therapist was “another black person.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to "blackmail."
Lindsay Flasco-Plaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day at work in 2016.
“Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
According to a New York Post report, after noticing the mouthpiece, Plasco-Plaxman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she now expected to hire a Filipina instead.
Ms. Morris was paid for one day’s work and sent home with Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple for dismissal, seeking compensation of $350 a day for six months of work and living in the place for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple fought back the claims that they were racists, saying Morris's employment was to be terminated, out of fear that they would not be able to trust her after she had been harmed.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Flasco, told the Post.
But did you put your child in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was an accident?
Your baby girl?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to “extortion” and said his wife was supposed to have given birth only two months before the incident and was “in a very difficult situation.”
Do you want to go after someone like her?
It’s not nice to do something like that,” the investment banker added.
The legal case is still underway, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing their behavior and the arguments they used.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Would Not Identify With A Talking Bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Junkel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s very entertaining to know now what we know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
After saying that her father, who worked for the BBC as a photographer before being inspired to write the children’s book by a little toy bear, had become bloodthirsty about rejecting his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was “bitter-sweet” after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Paddington's eventual success, whom she described as "a very important member of our family."
“He was a quiet man, not an arrogant man,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who was achieving something: you’re proud of him even though it’s not really because of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called regularly and said she was in a really bad condition, that she was unlikely to last," said Mrs. Adnan-Laphrose.
“And then I got a call from Ned saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly disappeared and went out of her system.
She died sometime before that and it's over, it's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t whine or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people right now.
I really had to hold on.”
Eventually, Ms. Adnan-Labrus, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers who were unaware of her agony.
No one will know,” she said.
My head was down, and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a gorgeous sense of identification with Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women grieving hang postcards on bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries hung postcards on a bridge in Walsh with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call to get support.
Ms. Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any other parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Laydeny, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone recognized him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated every room.
But he stopped working before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly afraid of a chain reaction.”
Ms. Davis created the postcards so that people would know that there was someone to turn to and talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don’t sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphries, Ms. Davis’ friend for years, lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the lowest point on Christmas Day—when the kids opened the presents, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they overcame it: “It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Burt Kavanaugh’s future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I was thinking, if we can really get what he asked for – a time-limited and limited investigation – maybe we can get a few to unite,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “be torn apart” in the deep-rooted party stalemate.
Why were Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not interested in an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance stems entirely from timing.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans fail, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea is falling under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-sig, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Union, said the number of defections last year was 1,127, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main causes were tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher charges for people smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, with which North Korea has the longest and easiest border to cross compared to the well-preserved military zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often returns them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which the two generally agreed to work towards an era where the Korean peninsula would not have nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. sanctions of lacking progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm first,” Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee “hysterical” and said his character did not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi responded to this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever showed up like this, they would say ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes almost screamed and choked when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee and called the arguments against him a “coordinated and grotesque character murder” organized because of the Liberals’ anger over Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he pursued the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh if his appointment was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she has concerns about Kavanaugh’s possible rulings against Obama’s health reform or the Ru v. Wade verdict, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about the possibility of overturning certain Supreme Court decisions.
“There is no reason for a man who is hysterical and biased to go to court and expect to be told, ‘Isn’t that great,’” Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It is a harsh criticism, months and years of overflowing rage, and it cannot express them without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, right?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager elsewhere, who said she too was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique and every time she got angry and started crying, she used to say to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears get the extra as a source of rage, in part because they are not understood in essence.
One of my most significant memories of an early job in my life, in an office with a male majority, was that I once found myself crying with inexpressible rage, and an older woman grabbed my backside, a career manager I had always feared a little bit of—and dragged me down the stairwell.
“Don’t let them see you ever cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re furious.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they managed to depress you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado congresswoman, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and walked out of the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason she wouldn’t consider running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a decision I thought about,” she told me 30 years later and laughed.
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Somebody called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she joined the campaign late, she was behind in raising the funds, so she swore she would not join the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she wondered.
At the time of her speech announcing that she would not start a formal election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to raise money and focus on voters instead of representatives, and anger at sexual discrimination — she was suffocated with tears.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled in the way the press reacted to her.
“You might think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my gravestone?
"She cried"?
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war has been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the opening shot earlier this year when he imposed a tax on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 million) worth of goods, effectively imposing taxes on half of goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing responded each time with the same currency, and recently raised tariffs by 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to strike back on every U.S. strike, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to surrender in the near future.
A request from Washington to withdraw would mean surrendering to its demands, but a public bow to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to conduct itself properly, the pressures from the trade war with the United States may positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of economic spirals in either country is actually far more dangerous than India previously anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, a research partner focused on Asia, at the New American Security think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is stable and safer thanks to the progress achieved in the war on terror,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All conditions now exist for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at harming their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive conditional aid or assistance from countries that funded the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5–10.5 at the National Golf Course outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it took to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mikaelson, who struggled for almost the entire tournament, sent his T-stake into the water in the 16th hole of the Far-3, losing the game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to reach 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the current structure, in 1979.
American actor Jordan Spit was defeated 5th and 4th by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's No. 1 player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Polter from England, which may be the last time he plays in the Ryder Cup.
With eight Ryder Cup seniors, Spanish Sergio García has become the European player with the highest number of wins in tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the trophy back.
It’s a team and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his countryman John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the singles game on Sunday.
“The immense pride I feel is defeating the Tiger Woods I watched growing up,” Ram, 23, said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3, culminating in the Ryder Cup in his career.
These are strange statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, with only Jack Niklaus in front of him.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find their way through the lawns, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Pinaw who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. National Team Captain Jim Furick said after his team’s disappointing performance, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Well done to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
I need to take my hat off.
We're defeated."
