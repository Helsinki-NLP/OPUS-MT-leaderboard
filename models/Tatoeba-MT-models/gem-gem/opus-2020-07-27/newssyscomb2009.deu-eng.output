Triumph of legal populations in Austria, totally 29 percent
Following the first preliminary findings, both parties to the former large coalition and a significant strengthening of the legal populist parties brought the preferred elections of Parliament from Sunday in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian Volkspartei (ÖVP) suffered losses, where the position of the former Chairman Wilhelm Molterer stands seriously on the pippe.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner national chief Jörg Haider, is prepared for a triumphal return to federal policy.
According to recent results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 percent of the most powerful votes in the country, but with the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian after-war history, and especially in the People's Party, who had demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had come out of the coalition, the Volkspartei had a clear advance before the SPÖ.
The electorates, however, have probably punished the party for failing the government.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible withdrawal of the chairman of the party and the former Vice Chairman Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Board of Parties.
Such development would probably lead to the most likely way out of the electoral debail, i.e. a renewal of the large coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both legal populistic parties - the Freedoms (FPÖs) received 18 percent provisionally, the BZÖs were 11 percent of the votes - but at the same time the Social Democrats expressed their fear that the year 1999 could repeat when the People's Party met with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, split off from the BZÖ in 2005) with regard to a common government, which even brought penalties from the European Union.
It is evident that Jörg Haider, who already declared that he was willing to cooperate with each party and goes from a return to Vienna to the Austrian Federal Policy.
In addition, the Green Party, which suffered light losses and was interrupted among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
There is no other party who has probably lost the 4-percent ceiling and therefore has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of the illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that it could be a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
This was highlighted by the Minister in New York after the present meeting with his Indian official colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, then there is a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the discussions, in judicial affairs the executives could only be difficult to intervene.
Despite all, he indicated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released by the prosecution and received a penalty, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"He's problem could be resolved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of freedom punishment, it would be the best of Mukherdshi's opinion if he went in a higher instance.
He could so ask for liberation for security and wait in freedom for his judgment, according to the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same opinion in negotiations.
"He recommends a call at a higher court, then gets a contempt in question for him," said the Chief of the Czech Diplomation.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the condemned 'competent legal support' to the condemned ministers.
At the same time, he said that such assistance is already offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, he confirmed, as the Czech press agency ČTK, before his partner, the Czech Republic has great importance for the problem of the Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
An answer to the question whether he had received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the Minister departed.
"I was already promised a lot," he only stated.
A Czech is directing on the ring around the sea ground
It enters an electronic map where Australia and the adjacent sea areas are pictured.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-headed team of UN divisions for oceans and maritime rights.
His boss, the Division Director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and adds it on and off.
Workellan and enthusiasm are here.
The sea ground has so far brought up a little well-known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here you can find oil, more arch and other non-advantaged raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a medicine against cancer.
A sea ground larger than the mainland
Today, the arrival countries reported their claim to the new sea areas.
After a UN Convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay at Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches some hundred miles far from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly expressed, as a continental shelf is considered the part of the sea floor and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the borders of the Ufer Sea, often also the limit of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be based on a comprehensive scientific-technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now only the three last-mentioned countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
A international echo recently found the success of Australia, which, as the first country, could increase its sea areas significantly.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sea floor, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that in the future flows to them from the use of the sea floor will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also progressively submit their requests.
You can do this for ten years from the moment when they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor, which the Convention calls "common heritage of mankind".
There's no State in here any more a special position.
The right to promote in this field gives an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor is not a golden graveland", says with some excessor director Mikulka and adds that "the individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former eastern block within the framework of the joint organisation "Interocean Metal".
In 1991, as well as the investors of some less other countries, they received the status of a so-called "road-breaking investor".
The organisation has the right to promote the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is a little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea ground.
"You can support there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich foundation of polymetall concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another lawyer, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
She reminds of a little potato or, with some imagination, the legendary scheme that raised the legend after the Golem to life.
German special forces were on the ground for hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
The circumstances of liberation of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are increasingly familiar with more details.
Indirectly, according to the Defence and Interior Ministry, German special forces were also involved in the rescue action.
Thus, both the Federal Army specialists and GSG 9 officials were the pilot stake of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aids Work at the Place of Liberation.
However, as spokesmen of the Ministry continued on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostage makers let their prisoners run and flee when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to engage in it as local support forces.
"Happyly, it has not come to this," said a speaker of the Federal Ministry.
An attackers had kidnapped the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and her eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt on September 19th.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostels in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and the Tsjaad were dragged down and retreated.
The identity of the hostage holders remained unclear until last as well as the details of the exemption or possible redemption payments.
The rescued have now arrived well in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostels are in the guard of the German message.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" newspaper, the five vacations and the special forces are to be evacuated with an airbus of the air weapon and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House Rejects Rescue Package
The first Chamber of the U.S. Congress has made the 700 billion dollars of severe rescue package for the financial markets hardly fail.
The Dow Jones went to the depth.
With 206 votes to 227, the US Representative House rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all appeals by President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme with which the chaos should be reduced to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the advocates had desperately tried to convince critics of the 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on the Members to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones broke in more than six percent or 600 points.
Reasons were concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote to then, after announcement of the failure, fall back.
Experts now expect further heavy turbulencies on the international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, the consent of both the House of Members and the Senate is necessary.
Increasing booking numbers are reported by organisers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel organizers:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak economic prospects, the Germans’ desire to travel remains unreasonable, according to a study.
In the winter season bookings, the rice offices recorded a turnover of 31 percent compared to the previous year period, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the GfK Market Research Institute, there are also increased bookings for the autumn months.
Thus, the turnover plus of the travel offices for October was about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV informed.
The basis for these results is GfK figures that evaluate monthly booking data of 1200 German travel offices and highly calculated for the whole market.
The travel bookings took place until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar price, travels to the United States were asked, the DRV informed.
This is about one third of the booking growth.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the homes of the Germans were specially asked destinations.
In particular, fast-chaling travels are high in the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of increasing costs for energy and food, the costs "for customers are better calculated than for individually organised holidays".
Money could save consumers, inter alia, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
Also the summer months had been very well booked, so that a turnover rate will be recovered compared to the previous year - although, according to a further study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time October festival
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer of liter crusts and promis in designer-dirdln.
A wheat debut.
Susanne and I don't have much common.
She's blond, TV-moderator and wears a customised dirdl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: Nearly three minutes on the wheat, even the photographers fall on us and cut the memory cards full - very flattering and that at my first wheat visit.
That's how you make friends.
The Cheap Dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the White Worstquator, the well-being felt remained in limitation until date.
But only once it arrived on the Theresienwiese, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirdl or leather pants; no one looks reversed or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Strange sights at the chocobanan stand only harvest my dirdles.
A coiner makes me aware that I would have tied the curtains wrongly: "Lefts high free, middle virgin, forgive right, back widow."
Homely, I freeze the loops from the back to the left.
"Pass," spoke and laughed.
Others make less efforts for subtle flirt techniques and wear light filthy shields on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretches out the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is Bob, comes from England and also visits the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn ooooo.
He tells me that after he has lost his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, of which everyone thinks he's a wastehouse.
So Bob is one of these famous "Wildbiezers".
Others do not have the happiness to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, sanitations run over the festival place that needs to take care of the poor suckers.
The nurses always appear in the rule - always four at a time drag a overthrown wear from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty back, completely back.
You don't see who's in the promille arch under the plane.
"These are those where goarnimmer packing," one of the sanitarys called to me on request and disappeared in the dumb.
Name of the accident victim known by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female coacher who died in the hospital after she was driven by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, resident in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on the Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was brought to Queen's hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident due to the suspicion of mild driving.
In the meantime, he was released to security.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey endeavoured to join the European Union, the European forces were interested in entering deep into the country behind Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, one of the finest relics of this failed, emperorial effort stands.
The Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits ridiculously at the end of the train climb with a tower on each corner of the front and thus looks like any provinceal German council.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building breaks down about
But once you are within the waved ticket switch, there is no doubt of the prosperity of the project, whose western access this was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolien-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late torch in the imperialist game, had before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East by a train connection to Damascus, Bagdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist projects embraced during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabia and its Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, produced by the inevitable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Railway Station.
In 1917 a ammunition train fled into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly broken, largely crossed by history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic Horizon of Tunisia.
The ACP, the governing justice and development party, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, produced by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approximation.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relationships with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the core data of this new foreign policy, I went the night to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hollow ride on rails that produced the equilibrium of the ancient world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered to be a new city for the new worldly government project to return to the Osmanic past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has triggered some of the distrusts in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the main business office of the ACP, a specially manufactured, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing forest, surrounded by half-finished shopping centres and knees in which middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first businesses of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Dress, Krawatte, I'm sure he's even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exceptional appearance," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its backland.
Today she has to look at east and west at the same time.
There's not either the one or the other.
She'd have to do both of them.
"But certainly Turkey could at some time," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "does not have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everybody I spoke with here almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are equally of advantage for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transmitted sense, Europe as a whole can travel on eastern rails towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's railway station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German governments Mr. Ritter and Mr Conu who had been watching this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too wide parts, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the site for the ferry that should bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at that time, there seemed to be little doubt about what continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In the memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon was "Dead" Handley (after call on 11 September) responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, next year.
He was intended for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer) was for the willingness and ability of the chorus, any music piece presented to him to attack whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young chorus was often astonishing, always exciting and consisted solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never read for years.
How often death stopped us to "let the music talk for ourselves".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it's singing!"
His kind of conduct was absolutely clear and precise, never glorious, but never overwhelming.
Whatever the musical level was, he always demanded a higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any dirigent had to be struck to the rider, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the past 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He abhored the conductors, according to his words, simply "going home with one or two known sculptures in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (25 September) you write that "he took over the education of economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from a author's comment in Woodruff's book "Even of Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a teacher of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, who later published as "The British rubber industry" in 1958.
He was in 1950-1951 in the United States in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham definitively and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to exchange this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their lightness and of the power they shine, as they always deal with respect with the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magic moments."
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda captures the marketing of the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large inner space, this large space limousine offers a much larger.
To this end, the technical units that allow even more comfortable driving and saving petrol are also available.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aestheticly, the new Jazz has a similar line to his predecessor, the changes made in this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism will be emphasised.
However, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new Jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, created to renew this model for shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon with regard to its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where the Jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars, which are 17 % of the assumed growth on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold 8 000 Jazz models since 2002. This is 6.7% of the total sales in Honda in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the heads of the branches in Spain expect to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows the selling in Spain.
In fact, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22 000 models. This is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this sales increase, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda sets on the appearance of a new model.
It is insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models per year throughout the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50 % of insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of insight on the market is intended for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axis is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the inner space is also enlarged.
This success, on the one hand, is due to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel container, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
The capacity of the baggage space, which has a double charging system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation baggage space.
It must be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with an 1.4 litre petrol engine, as the capacity of the dog Jazz bag space with a 1,2-liter benzine engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panorama windows, improved access to seats is provided.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of his marketing, this small model has 2 performances of the fuel engines: 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance, while at the same time providing speedy power for the entire engine running time.
The first variant with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 PS at 6000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and carbon emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the pre-engine that reached 83 PS at the previous generation, he is now able to reach 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Biene' which avoids collisions
To promote the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarm behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the Technical Development Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety sign.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important is the facet eye of the bees, which can see over a angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing them to fly uninterrupted into their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to imitate the Round Perspectives, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notes obstacles that are in distance from BR23C up to two meters and are in 180 degrees radius, calculate the distance to the object and send a signal to a boardy microprocessor, which is translated directly into signal for the prevention of collision
`In the moment when obstacles are noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this avoidance is absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot could not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, ' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the Director of Engineering of this Project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot vary upwards or downwards, but also not overcrowde; he can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to rotate his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way as it makes the bees.
For this reason, Nissan used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require to store the information or the intuitive logic of the manuscripts made, so it can continuously work with only a couple or a couple of dozen KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in developing technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan has foretold in the next ten years in the series cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and keep longer than the diversity of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the ride to the goal and avoid the obstacles on the way.
She's on the shake before she's being charged with a hypothec.
It must be realized that the Ministry of Finance of the United States, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, but is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the involvement of US citizens in hypothesis stories of the supposedly payable banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for the Internet surfers: 'Bad Credit Hotel', says it.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of bad loans' or of interference.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially his receptionist is to think about one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask no loan.
And especially where you can do it, what is probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is rather a side for teenagers than a place for all the observers.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreamful room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into their company, with which this would be the first bank in Japan, spending $9 billion, thus taking 21% of their capital, a new one that is due to a strong case of their exchange course.
One week after a provisional agreement had been published, the two banks declared that MUFG would buy 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley stammacotine at the same price of $25.25, which would result in a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is below 19% of the price value of the share of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will guarantee you a profit of 10% and can be sold again at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be done on the basis of a single average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley share decreased by 6.79% to $23.07 by 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," explained John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which will allow him to expand its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more careful attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed during the last days: Last Monday Morgan had simply explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
In Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, CEO of the MUFG, we thought that the participation would consist entirely of tribal shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce and secure the risks.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go away with a reduction of profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into stock shares in one year if the latter will be exchanged to more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, i.e. to about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a group press speaker refused to make more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment capacity rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan declared that he had dropped his balance since the end of August.
The last weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their exchange rate decreased by half, while the price for insurance against payment inability speeded up to the height.
This price decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only more 'overliver' of the large investment banks at the Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic rebuilds about the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorian Rafael Correa.
The third one, following this Sunday, the example of his companions and friends, was the plan for a new constitution.
Mission fulfils because, according to 80% of the voters, 64% voted with 'Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted with 'no', 7% of the electoral list were invalid and 0.7% were released empty.
In order to adopt the Constitutional Project, more than half of all votes must be voted.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exits of the election sites and announced a non-governmental organisation a clear victory for 'Ja', and prophesied 63% to 70%.
In the evening of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had called for the victory of his constitutional project.
"The Constitution has triumphated in an overwhelming way," he had insured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 km southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean equal-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The elections held in silence under the Observatory of the United States Organization (OAS) were referring to a text of 444 points on the protection of 'new socialism' for which the President is taking place.
The Constitutional Project transfers the government's power to the economy by leaving it the exclusive right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from the oil promotion by foreign companies and by the devises who send immigrants to the country.
The project, which will be forwarded by the 2006-selected Correa, also gives the Head of State greater power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates per four years and will have the opportunity to dissolve the national meeting.
Correa announced that he would use this power and pursue a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already started to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants living in 50% of the population below the limit of poverty.
Finally, it also proposes to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorian base as a starting station for American anti-drug intervention.
The 19 hostages were liberated in the Chad
An Egyptian command started the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated by an Egyptian command in the Chad.
Apparently in good condition, at 15.30 a.m. on board a special plane, the hostel reached the military base al-Maza right next to the international airport of Cairo.
They were brought directly to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Kairo, on board a helicopter.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers were not paid a ransom', explained the Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the rolling field.
After she was captured on September 19 at the foot of the Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought from 35 unknown kidnappers from one hide into the next.
It is eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guardian and the Director of the Agency of Aegyptus, organiser of the Safari.
A Egyptian safety officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from the board of two helicopters, started the attack at night shortly before the morning dam.
`On both sides, shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the remaining fleeing,' said this responsible who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support by German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is right now, about the role of secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
`We must recognise that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special units," he explained without further details.
He also rejects that a ransom had been paid.
In the evening, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a terrain vehicle with a patrol, where the kidnappers were, six of which they were, including the leader from the Chad, killed and two arrests.
The army explained that they were connected to a rebel group from Darfour, the movement Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, contradicted this movement immediately.
Letters - The quiet majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is a series of texts and is a key topic of the current electoral struggle.
It's better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in forgottenness.
Who will rise up and practise the harmful sums that are given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national historical places that are hungry?
What politician will dare remind the Federal Government that it neglects her monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That there are no proper laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that protect our cultural heritage effectively?
Did you know that the French government provides EUR 3.5 million only for the restoration of the Castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
Our American neighbours are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the American culture, and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical companies of Quebec, at least 40.000 honoring officials gathered in 211 historical corporations to deal intensely with the history, to save the numerous private archives with a few groceries and to obtain archaeological remains.
They are also often the guard dogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when supporters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten gardens.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state parts of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states, with a partial statution, want to take the arms of the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank, which is caused by the U.S. financial crisis in Turbulenzen: The three countries provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has establishments in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level in the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the Eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been persistent for a year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the Bank could have a prerequisite characteristic.
For the purpose of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 per cent.
The Bank is likely to sell a part of its shares, all the insurance activities bought by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis started a steep valley last week, where the second half of the weeks already marked serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a Pleite.
The institution's securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year depth.
Since then, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, but is unrealistic according to management.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion is expensive US rescue package and the uncertainty caused by it on the markets is due to the valley journey of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed a new Director-General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but no interested person found a business offer.
However, the Belgian government was endeavored to calm down - no investor is supposed to blame for his money, he said.
There is no panic among the customers until now, the branches of the bank have not been stormed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has separate branches, but it also calls leasing companies her own.
Fuchs in Hühnerstall
Due to the drug consumption of a person, life and health insurance often refuses to conclude a contract with a customer in America.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could be uncontrolled.
"There are data protection programmes that are linked to the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hand, otherwise we trust the chickens" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the follow-up of prescription data.
Insurance shall determine the fees and payment amounts in the event of damage depending on the customer’s health status and, if the risk is estimated too high, the insurance will not be completed.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was only concluded in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a far more favourable method: using the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmaceuticals, speaking what preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from what the client suffers from and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering medicines, it was found that his blood fat levels are untreated, which would automatically bring him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplikator, so that insurance only more needs to make the paper crochet, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraine and heat walls, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurers’ viewpoint, while the above not.
For the inquiry and processing of the data, its own companies have formed themselves, which, before they relate to the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, although submissions have not yet been negotiated.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and connect them to the data on drug consumption. They thus provide an even more precise picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a personal data protection law for health data, its effect is limited only to healthcare providers and insurance.
The draft legislation has already been submitted to the Congress that the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can be transmitted only with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned is hardly able to prohibit access to his data, since the insurance is otherwise not to conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are only left somehow the grace of the fog.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main topic in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit, which is discussed mainly on cooperation in the nuclear energy sector, also takes place.
Although the European Union recognises that India is a prominent, democratic power, which should be given more votes and agreements on international matters, the Member States have not yet agreed whether they should support the permanent membership of New Delhis in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and the current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade in the next five years, i.e. to EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods had increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this respect, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India were also legally summarised into an agreement, so that air traffic is also being flourished in the future.
By 2009, India wishes to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the palace.
The aim is to create a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: While the Union is the partner number one of India's partners, New Delhi is only nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
The situation was in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or the terrorism that both sides strongly condemned, and the call for a UN Conference was also urged.
The Doha round should also be completed, both sides are guilty of failure.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, i.e. the reduction of pollution emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as the proposal to conclude a global compromise at the coming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The increase in food prices should also be combated, so both support the calling for an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government today visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
However, in Paris, orders to French companies are expected to be worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to reports by the Agency, the Agreement is to be adopted at 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong Presence Italian publisher at the International Frankfurt Buchmesse.

The missing small aircraft of the billionary Steve Fossett found again a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, which was disappeared over the desert of Nevada on 3 September 2007, was found.
The individual parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m height, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammot Lakes between the state of California and Nevada.
However, within the plane no human remains were found.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, defended the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located and a troop was sent to. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett fled on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its closeness.
The 63-year-old billionary was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Office for Transport Safety (Ntsb) noted that a team was sent out a few hours after the aircraft was seen, which identified the machine: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fosset started in Yerington in Nevada at a 3-hour flight.
Lastly, in California, near the border of Nevada, some of the personal items of Fossett were found by a couple near their house at the Mammot Lakes.
It is two signs with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been resigned a month after its disappearance.
The billionary had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002 he managed to circulate the world’s ball in a airball in the sixth time of his first life: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without intermediate landing with a plane.
Under its several records, an altitude flight of 15445 m over the Andes is also counted, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv, falling from the conventional schema by its original design and the special line management, the outlining surface and its clear angle.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroader to induce new breathing in the sector.
Just because of its extraordinary properties, the idea of Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from October 17, onwards.
Thus, the advertising chamber, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also occur in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a new thing in the car sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum burden that will be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping miles of Milan, to Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near Corso Como to give a special optic: the new Suv will appear in its nearly real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so apparently from the poster on which it is pictured.
This is illustrated in all its details using the Elumina8 technology of the new Glk in different moments, in order to resume it as a whole.
With this advertising, it is doubtless the concern of Mercedes to introduce a new type of author clam in this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in raising the interests of future buyers? We will see it.
Now is clear who are the Italian Hooligans
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stage ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all of Italy is now shameful? They are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", which has traveled behind the Italian national team for years and, honestly, have not caused serious problems until recently.
Never happened collisions with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The supporters came from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, there were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the military appear, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a conflict with a truly right-radial fan scene, that of Levski.
By the Figc, the Italian fans had 144 cards available for the game: all were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among the travelling to Sofia, no one was present with a running stage ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, which were already preloaded in this respect, were also refused to travel to Bulgaria.
Now, the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to initiate further steps: in this case, the caught or identified Tiposi can expect a stage ban of at least five years.
It is an international ban that prevents access to stages throughout Europe.
So our Hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation sites, which could follow them little more than 150.
"This fire must be eliminated immediately, and that does not in any case give such a behavior the possibility of justification," says the Viminal.
That's why, "Aye to especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sport Supervisor) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can be counted on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services dealing with the problem of the stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a criminal offence..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli, which has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ultras Italy founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, but doubtless this behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – add the number 1 of the Osservatorio – crime is committed in the country of their deed.
Until now, this group had been in the tower, but now it has to be considered what has happened and what will happen.
But we also talk about the phenomenon during the Hymne Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but they allow me, but there is no education...".
