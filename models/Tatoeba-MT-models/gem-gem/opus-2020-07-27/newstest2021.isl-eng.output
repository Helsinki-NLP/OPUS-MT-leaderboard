Crying on the World
The market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well, and crying and crying out in nature has begun to draw people wide and wide around the world.
“ You own the collision, I need Iceland, ” says a woman out there in the big world, commenting on an advertisement from the market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland at YouTube.
Another audience will keep Iceland in her heart forever, and a young woman claims that she must come to Iceland for the first time as a friend of her dwelling there.
However, unfortunately, it is in the United States and expects to wait for a few months.
Another audience asks whether the route to Iceland is capable, because there are no planes.
The story does not follow if it comes from another time zone.
The Egill Thordson of the Peel Advertisement Agency, who came to the formation of the advertising and the M&C Saatchi International Advertising Agency, says that receptions have been hoped again.
“I came to a lot of Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already begun to hit a meteor.
Basically, this is about creating PR values, that's to get foreign media to deal with the campaign, and it's gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short time, we have been discussed in some seven hundred media worldwide, totally reaching over two billion people.
The value of this review is estimated at $1 billion.
It's not funny."
The main market is the United States and has gone very well there, even though the Americans are not on their way to the country.
According to Egil, a well - known market area, such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany, has also accepted itself, one Russian, who is a comfortable surprise.
Then there were reactions from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specially addressed.
“ These advertisements have traveled far more than we expected, ” says Egill, but over four million people may have watched YouTube.
"We couldn't have wanted after a better start."
The pictures on the opening took Ann Säberg, the photographer of the morning magazine, on advertising that shows the title “Let It Out ” in the middle of the last month.
The roofs went wide and wide, such as at the school guards of Reykjavik, in the field of Reynis, at Shogarfoss, on the sunsheaven, and in the cave of the heads of the Heaven.
The directors of the game were Samuel Bjark the son of Peter, and Gunnar Paul Olafsson of the Shooter of Production, and the captain of the son of Godna.
The roles of the teeth were the island Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
Twenty islanders came to the advertisements, but at the same time as the recording in Southern was another group in the Western and the West Feather.
According to Egil, "Let It Out" is only the first joint in Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but a winter campaign is planned in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first stage in this work for the Icelandic Laboratory,” says Egill, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been very well.
“ It’s great to work with them.
In such tasks it is important to have foreign collaborators with knowledge of the markets we're talking to."
Explosives: Discussing the jobs in the labour market, a survival fund, and much more
Onear Dadason's social and childcare minister, meets in Sprengisand, which begins at ten o'clock on the wave today.
He is also a Labour Market Minister and discusses the position in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more.
He also discusses rural areas and transports to a disadvantaged land that has been divided over the past years and decades.
Ragnar Tor Ingolfsson, chairman VR, will also meet, but he will discuss his criticism of investments in biotechnology funds and proposes ideas that labour mobility and professionals will withdraw from the governments of the funds to reduce the risk of interest arrays.
Then they will be discussed with Ivar the son of Ingimar, a tour servant in Austria, and Annheith John’s daughter, the Executive Director of the North Marketing Office, on the post of travel services in the countryside.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading offer for what will come.
Listen to the factor below, but it begins at ten o’clock.
That's how she looks today 25 years later
Elisa Donovan, the playster, had a successful course in the youth - classes of any kind.
However, she was world - famous for her game as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
Then she also played in the factors Sabrina: The Teenage Witch and Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
It has not been carried out in the past, but she has been able to look over the way and speak about Clueless in a lovely TV in the day.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she's been a great person.
“ I have to admit that I built my personality mostly on girls that I met at school that were not good for me.
As soon as I read the manuscript, I knew who that person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
I didn't want to leave the police station after nightmare.
Approximately fifty cases came on board the police in the capital area today, stating in the police diary that the matter has changed.
The day at the local gate police station began by the need for a policeman to deal with a person who had recently been released from a prisoner’s cell after having stayed for a raid.
If the man did not want to leave after he was released, he did not obey the instructions of a policeman who told him to leave.
Due to the progress of the police station, the man won a permanent stay.
Then a man was arrested in the morning year suspicion of invasion in a company in Kopavogi.
Police also needed two men in Brethochi because of announcements of body attack.
Then, too, a woman sitting at the shop center in Kopavogi was unable to pay for the account at the end of the meal and was therefore called to a police officer.
In the middle of the city, this morning, a stable car was announced.
The driver of the white Renault ambassador looked from her for a while, and she was then taken a free hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Good Wealth - The Frightful Destiny of the Glass Horns
The teaching has reached a flight on the Internet that a curse rests over the rank of the joy team, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the day and thereby became the third main player of the elements to make life far forever.
The features of the joy team (e. Glee) are a popular series of songs, dances, and joy.
The facilitates about the so - called joyful team of youths at school, their love, and their fate.
It was not always taken out with the celebration to be in the joy team, but through singing and dancing, individuals seemed to overcome the circumstances of their lives.
But outside the scenes, great disasters have run over the players and the staff of the factors, so much that teachings have wake up for the curse of the factors.
Naya Marie Rivera took the role of Santona Lopez in the factors, a klapper who didn't call all his grandmother.
After the series had run its stage, Rivera went to have the player Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for home violence against his husband and was divorced as a result.
However, Dorsey refused to submit dearly, and the issue of domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, last year, Rivera was reported to be missed after her four - year - old son found himself running in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy felt sleeping in a rescue west on board the boat and could tell the police authorities that he and his mother had swept to swim, and then Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but never returned to it.
The search for Rivera was great.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area reported that we were looking after Rivera had drunk.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
It is estimated that she had a high flow of water and had a new final requirement to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took the role of Finn Hudson in the factors, the American footballer, with the angel voice that played a key role in bringing the Merry Team to glory and respect.
Yet, outside the factors, Moneith struggled with a personal devil.
Since the age of 13, he had suffered from addiction and proved difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues felt that they had enough, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to look better.
Only two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith felt dead in a hotel room after having gone out to entertain with friends.
Banamein was a deadly mixture of membranes and alcohol.
It was not considered to be a willing work.
Moneith had been treated, and his tolerance before congestion had decreased so much that the dose he had previously endured was deadly.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his colleagues, but on the basis of his opposition wife, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking the factors and dedicated them to the memorial of Moneith and his personality of Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah “Puck ” Puckerman in the factors, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his participants in the Joy, or until he became discouraged to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles for the protection of child porn.
In his home, we searched for a huge amount of child pornografie, and the matter soon asked publicly.
It was evident that Salling had been.
As a result, he was accused and accused of his fraud.
He had four to seven years of prison, as well as what he came to have to be on record of sexual offenders and seek treatment for childish greed.
Before a judge had decided the punishment, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found to be killed near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
There were not just players who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director.
He became prompt in sleep in 2013, only 41 years of age.
At the factors, a woman named Nancy Motes also won.
She was the younger sister of Julia Robert’s great star, and she did not carry her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great control and disrespect.
Motes took her own life in 2014, who suffered severe depression.
She left a letter to her loved one, in which she told her mother and sister to be responsible for her experience.
“ My mother and my so-called siblings have nothing left me except the reminder that they were the ones who caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the factors.
She has recently been accused of using her participants on a single and transcendential site and having an abundance of stars.
Jesse Luken took a guest role in the factors in 2012.
He was arrested and charged for raising in 2019, which felt a lot of harmful.
Heather Morris, the playster, played a major role in the factors.
In 2010, she found that unwrought computers came into nectar pictures of her and were on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the factors and in love outside the factors.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used her violence in the relationship.
There can be flowers on almost everything
It increases the maturity of children when they get to play in the garden with their parents to cultivate flowers and watch them grow and grow.
It is also possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel pointed out.
Just having time with the children in the garden is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the smell, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Bought a boat after tenth grade
“ I don’t think we are a lot of seafarers who work in the country’s play schools, ” says Axel Örn Gottmundsson, who is hunting the beaches in the summer, but who teaches psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter. ”
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer work when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have good income, and I find it great to get rid of a study loan.
The revenues also do me well in the winter," says Axel Örn Godmundson, a 25-year-old psychologist who is fishing for the beach in summer as last summer.
Axel was the youngest to browse the Talkfire when a journalist came to speak from him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The friend I was in the tenth grade, I took the shipowner’s right for boats under 12 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after completion of the primary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat used by my familiar, the son of John, Heartman; and I called the boat his name.
He had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being on the sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat had his name.
He died a few years after I took the boat,” says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“ I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer, but the other half at the end of summer when I had been hunting.
So I had the boat without guilty at the end of this first summer on him."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out a boat when he had recently completed a basic school?
“ When I was a boy, I was all summer hunting with him and got my share.
I also put my quadratic money into my boat's treasure."
Axel is born in the feder of Isa, from where all his mother's people are; but he has lived in Kopavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the western area because I have a lawyer at my grandmother in the Izafird.
I learned in this area here west of the roots with my dad.
I'm going over the distance by how I feel, because this hunting area extends across the western feather.
Even though I feel best to be in the west, I have also provided around the Snowdrop and abroad.
I have also given the south, but then I prefer a grey leap," says Axel, who always runs one fire in the morning and says sometimes speaking to the moon and singing before the sky, in the lonely hours together on the ball sea.
“ The online connection on the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to radios and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid landing in a hurry, but surely sometimes something has been weathering, but never a great danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never a marine disease.
He says that the length of the day of work depends on how the hunting works every time.
“I am never more than 14 hours hunting at the beach at once, but I have also been hunting in other systems, for example in the rent quota, but I have been constant for one and a half a day in a bitch on the sea fishing. ”
He claims to be in the beach fishing arrangement so that he can hunt 770 pounds a day, which he feels hamland.
“ Other restrictions are that I should not catch Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I may only catch 12 days a month, these four months of fishing for the beach, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, seafarers should choose their hunting days by weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is to be calm instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to their heads.
So the area change may also go because of me, and the sea space that is well located at the fishing area should be enjoyed," says Axel, who takes the largest thirsty from salted seas on its coastal fisheries, but also only rough and rare other species are flying.
Axel is working over the winter with the university in Nupi School in Kopavogi.
“ I don’t think we are a lot of sailors who work in the country’s play schools, ” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only intended to work temporarily at the school.
“ I am stuck there because I find this awesome job.
I hope the psychology study will take advantage of me at the school level in the future," says Axel, who is also far from a business study.
Error registering preventing home check
An error in a recording magazine that people fill in when it arrived in the country led to the fact that a person, living in this country, was not called back in a show.
It is not conditional for a registration number if the person fills out the form in English, as is it when it is done in Icelandic.
“ This will be examined during the week, ” says a physician in the field of pest.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed at the National Hospital Virus Department yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules on so - called homemare were applied.
Those living in Iceland are then scared at the land arrival and again preached in a show four to five days later.
In the lunch news, however, it appeared that the person would have followed the old system.
The border show was negative, and he was not called back in the ski for the virus.
Camilla Ruth Sigfus ’ daughter, a physician expert in the field of pharmaceuticals, says in conversation with a newsroom that this may lead to a mistake in the electronic recording magazine.
If people fill in the registration magazine in English, it is not necessary to insert a number of IDs like it is in the Italian version.
In fact, it was mainly thought for foreign travelers.
Therefore, the person has not been automatically invited to show.
However, Kamilla says that many have followed the rules on home port, even though they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases, employers have also been alert to send people back to shows after it came to the country.
“This will be examined during the week how to facilitate accessibility to the process. ”
The man is in isolation, and six have been put into a pathway.
All of them are showing, but two of them began to show symptoms.
The three infections that were diagnosed yesterday are now underway, mostly due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there is a variation of the crown virus that has not been found here before.
In the second case, the bands have directed Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Camilla says that tomorrow it should be where the other virus was coming.
Overall, 15 are in isolation according to the tissue COVID.
135 are in suspicion.
Four of five infections disconnected
In the past few days, five domestic meats have been identified in this country.
Of these, the four alphars are unrelated and are not to form the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports convention yesterday.
It's still in the past.
Originally, in the third decade, the infants were sent to an extraordinary decline to sixteen.
In general, 34 are infected because of these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
For the second time, this is a short time that is diagnosed by sports events and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
John K. Johannsson, a commander of the General Warning Office, says that as long as people comply with the rules and rules, they can do so.
“ We are constantly inclined for all those who live here to maintain individual infectious contraceptives.
We also need to insist on those who are holding events that there are certain rules that need to be applied.
Then it is possible to keep an event,” says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping on the air of individual contraceptives.
In addition, the rules and guidelines are in a continuous review.
“ What needs to be done, and what the Public Protective Office and the Ministry of Land Medicine are constantly pressing for people, is in mind of these individual infections.
Both homes and the same with service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from going on,” says John.
“ We need to urge people to continue on the good way we were on, in order to maintain the success we have made here to benefit. ”
40% of victims of COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard her father had to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, and she urged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was led to sudden difficulty in breathing due to crown virus infections.
Diabetes mellitus was reported on the death certificate as an underlying problem and Brumfield, also with diabetes, is deadly afraid that the same will happen.
The Reuters newsgroup does not say the fear of Brumfield without reason.
Counts of new studies conducted by the US authorities show that less than 40% of those who had diabetes 2 were underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is examined, the proportion increases to half.
The study of the U.S. C.D. (CDC) took up more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the crown virus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC infectious expert, says that the results are striking, not least for those who have diabetes mellitus 2 and their loved ones.
It was hidden in the slow growth of Reuters that made an investigation and pointed out the answers from the 12 countries answering to comparable proportions.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet been reported on underlying diseases.
“ Diabetes had already been in a slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has been violated as a powerful age," says Reuters by Elbert Huang, Director Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among blacks and people of south-American origin, which has also worsened from the crown virus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in the process of body cultivation, solid diet, and helping healthcare professionals.
However, the coronary virus age has made many hard to keep a bus.
In this case, a high price of insulin has been used to continue working and thus discontinue exposure to the virus.
Reuters suggests that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the danger of diabetes patients with 2 may have caused the virus.
When the SARS crown virus exceeded in 2003, over 20% of them had the disease, and in 2009, this group was at three times more likely to need to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were put into the care of diabetes had diabetes mellitus.
Charles S. Dela Cruz scientist at Yale university says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could have been longer, the epidemic would have cut off the hide of a number of previously unknown complications.
“ I fear that when this is done, we will see a flood wave of problems, ” says president Andrew Bolton of the International Association of Diabetes.
Doctors have warned that the corneal virus age could indirectly lead to an increase in complicational diabetes disorders, including kidney diseases and renal clearance.
Similarly, new studies aim to allow the crown virus to lead to the increase in diabetes infection.
Reuters says that scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the crown virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs already ill in many patients with diabetes.
In this case, a high proportion of glucose and lipid in diabetes can produce a true “cell messenger ” as called when the immune system responds too hard and attacks the body.
Defective inhibitor cells may also lead to inflammation that can cause fatal blood clots again.
“ This is all one big puzzle game, ” says Dela Cruz.
“This is all related to the burden.”
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited champagne, and they left the room."
The Assron Magnus’s daughter and Atli Bollason received the unusual prayer from the artist Ragnari Kjartans Son to engage in sex before a camera for the work of the artist in Paris.
“We loved each other so this was not complicated.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and grandmother, Asrona Magnus’ daughter.
“ I was very delighted by her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but so it also felt quite incredibly sweet.
And still thinks," he says.
Asron also recalls this end, the husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
“ I am always hearing this story.
The last weekend," she says, who was also attracted to the husband at the first time.
“ I felt and felt as much anxiety around Atla, as I elephant.
There's a lot of things going on and a lot to happen, and I've been cursed about it."
Atli says that the couple have emphasised their own ways in their relationship.
“ We do not bind our bags to the same knobs as the traffickers.
We're avoiding the buses we're dealing with around us."
There is a possible reason why they took the article from the Ragnari Kjartans son of a photographer, but it would be most slightly said unusual.
“Cristin Anna, our common friend, contacts us and asks us whether we can come to eat desert with her, Ragga and Ingiber's wife, on the Snaps. ”
They accepted the invitation, hit the three snaps, and they received desert wine, and their refuge.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans on a picture show that he thought he would set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris in the autumn.
“ He had a multitude of knowledge, called Scenes from western culture.
He declared it in a simple way."
Asron says that he described the work as a banal and decaded late from the everyday life of the western countries.
“ He had a scissor of all the scenes he wanted to shoot, and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part. ”
Senan that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in showing young interstitutes to love in a minimal room.
“These are interactions with the beginning and end,” says Atli.
The couple knew Ragnar little, even though they knew about him, and he of them “but they knew us and felt that we were suitable for this.
They had words that they would not want to advertise for people.
They may have thought that they would not get the right people, but people who would have sexual prosperity from performing for others."
They stopped Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take a long time.
“ When we ran out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Are we not just in this?
It was just that way.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his team," says Ásron and Atli.
“This is about love and neighbor”
Senan was taken into a fine apartment on the Moor Street.
There was a very small film compartment; a recorder, Ragnar, and a musician, and the pair.
After the recording was turned on, all of us left the room to wait out in a car except Atli and Ásron.
“ We hadn’t decided how we should be.
We received some little instructions, but we tried to forget time and place.
To be unconscious of what we were doing and for each one.
It wasn't the game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásron.
But was that romantic?
“ Yes, it was a little romantic, ” says Atli and Australia agree.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being a vacation at a fine hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the pair in the work that moved them.
“ When a Tommi picker looked at this, he cried, it felt so beautiful to him, ” says Atli.
“ This is just as much about love as neighbors, ” says Ásron.
The Parent’s parents have seen the work, and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in the son of the Archive of Reykjavik, and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and begins to hit this, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this way, but so my dad just sent me a message and said, "Happy attacking the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Assron recalls.
And would the participant in the work have diminished the relations of Australia and Atla?
“ At least we are still together, so maybe this deepened something.
This deepened my relationship with my related family,” says Ásron and laughs.
Asron himself saw the work in the Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I felt a little hard not to be with you, but with someone else, ” she says and turns to the husband.
“ But it was fun to see this because this is just one second in a much bigger work, and when you saw it with the other works, this is very great.
I was able to cut myself off of this, and I was just proud.
And there was the little bene in my stomach,” says Ásron, who was pregnant by the other child of the couple when the sena was taken up.
"This was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to the Assurians and Atla in the Astronomy at Channel 1.

Unsigned for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. Messenger in Iceland, is a casting media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted a armed lifeguard, fearing his life.
However, it has not been hard for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here.
Since Carol Van Vorst left the office of the American Ambassador in April of 2009, all of this has been an ambassador in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Fürst left his office under special circumstances, but Kastlys reported that she should have received the False Words in 2009.
During a meeting with Iceland’s president, she received a call from the presidential office that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations with the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until the afterman Van Vorst came to work, in September 2010.
To some extent, Robert S. Connan could have been appointed a messenger, but then stopped.
At the work, Loius Ariega finally had worked for decades in the foreign service.
He then left the jobs in the autumn of 2013 and took over the office of a missionary in Guatemala.
Then, another announcementary period took place.
Robert Barber received the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and soon later came to work, but then no missionary had been there for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not diplomati, but he had served as a lawyer and a short electoral council of Baracks Obama.
He left work as soon as Donald Trump took up the presidential office on January 20, 2017, as the usual has politically appointed ambassador.
Trump’s ruler was unusual in order to place both ambassadors and high officials in the Washington government system.
Thus, two years passed until the U.S. assembly proclaimed Jeffrey Ross Gunter at his meeting to ask him out and confirm then as a missionary in Iceland.
In his preaching at the sitting, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife who was deceased had been broken from a Dutch mountain.
Gunter is politically appointed, was previously a skin physician in California and has been prominent in the Jewish organizations of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The playback owner Sheldon Adelson established them as a organization, but Adelson is an intrigued supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then there had been no missionary in the country from the beginning of 2017, for two years and four months, which is the largest example of the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s government was to appoint people in a key office, and that the United States Parliament has worked in recent years very long, including confirmation of ambassadors.
Since 2009, there has been a total of untransmitted hosts in Iceland for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the execution of the missionary council, which opened a new headquarters at Engageig.
The performances are estimated to have costed some 6.5 billion but knee-containing safety walls the building and shot glass is in all windows.
However, it seems that it has not been enough to fill the current missionary’s feeling of security because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wished for a armed guard.
A former IBV player suffered racism in Iceland, “It was a mistake to come to Iceland ”
Tonny Mawejje, former IBV player, claims to have suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets that he has come to the country.
This is a interview with Tonny, who appears in the Ugandisk Mediterranean Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, who plays in the top section of Uganda.
In the Daily Monitor interview, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in the country that he played with IBV, Val and Iceland Development.
“ When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The leader of the team was in that position, but in addition, he was also with the crew number I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," says Tonny, but he played on the right side of the stage with IBV.
One of the things Tonny speaks is racism that he had in Iceland.
He says that this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“ This happened once to me, but since I did not understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
And he told me that my opponent had let racial remarks fall about me after I tempted him."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he has made the mistakes that he sees most of the remaining.
Tonny had not been able to get to the Haugesund first team, but he wanted to play more to get to the team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, and then he went to Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland to loan.
I think if I had been longer in Norway then I'd have the opportunity I wanted,” says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably be longer.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland made out of his dreams of getting into Europe.
Find a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 cm long black worm in a necklace woman looking there.
The physician managed to pull the worm out with a tunnel.
A study revealed that it was about snail animals.
CNN explains this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, which is thin meat seeds.
Soon after the worm was removed, the woman improved, but snail animals such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, after sushi has run to bed in the western countries, cases of snailing animals have grown.
Fear that other waves are beginning in Europe
Spain is now in the light of concerns about the second wave of the European crown virus, where governments have taken action to re-enforce the spread of the crown virus age.
For two weeks, all entertainment has been put on ice for Catalonia, more cities than Barcelona, where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also undertaken measures due to the increase in the number of infections in Spain, but in Britain, all have to go into a fog for the return from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned from travel to Spain.
In France and Germany, sickness is also increasing, where governments are seeking to find a balance in stopping the spread of the virus and bringing economic life back.
However, the situation in Europe is good in relation to elsewhere in the world, but the global incidence of infections is close to 300 000 a day, where the most likely infection is in America and South Asia.
Verified infections have become 16 million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University count, and are deaths confirmed in connection with the virus become 644 thousand.
The Mosaic Acts of the Generators eventually enjoy their fullest
In front of the Tollhouse in Reykjavik, there is a big and deep hole.
The top of it is a man with an orange helmet.
There's also a big grave.
And more smaller machines.
The gate is closed for traffic.
Yet, the championship is capable, and there many are now stinging and respecting artworks from millions of mosaics — as they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it does not respect it.
The job has been somewhat hidden, right in front of it was a car place that was always in place.
People lay there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to take care of their ears in the centre of the city.
The ‘liquid and diversity of public spaces’ and ‘advantaged city’ are guided by the reconstruction of the Trygggate currently ongoing.
The goal is to facilitate the area and allow mosaic work to make a sacred daughter in the Tollhouse to enjoy a better vision.
In front of the work, the area is well sunbed, it is considered suitable as a dwelling area for roadfarers.
The artwork will be declared, and the material tree will now enjoy better than before on this 142 square meters surface.
In the area, there will also be small “dockers, ” some kind of water sculptures, offering a game and providing the area with a certain mystery.
In this way, the refinements are described by Reykjavik City, which is being carried out in conjunction with Vitums.
Water supply, heat and electrical systems will be renewed.
Many of them have arrived in their years, but the schools and cold waters have been from 1925 and have served inhabitants and businesses in central towns for a short period of centuries.
When the gate is reopened after the completion, cars can drive it again.
However, it will become a single policy gate, and as soon as it creates more quiet and accessible space for walking.
In a newspaper on the customs office of the tax manager’s web, it was in use in 1971, which was the architect of Gisli Halldor’s son.
Because the harvests reached through the house, there were 250 square feet of windowless walls out to the street.
The Building Committee and the Architecture agreed that such platforms would have a bad impact on the overall gate image, if no special arrangements were taken to practise the appearance of the house.
Thus, people agreed to calculate by setting up a permanent artwork there.
At that time, a great deal of words of the Gende Holy daughter, an artist, says in the summary.
If she had worked much on mosaic art works in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before a decision would be made to compete for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the port, for the port had been a liposon of Reykjavik since it was made.
When discussed with the artist’s wife, she had to trace the sense of such work.
It agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she returned from the country, where she would work with the suggestions in abroad.
She had the time she had to decide on her own, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
Immediately, she was agreed to ask her to do the job.
In addition, it was requested to make a total agreement with it and the famous artistic company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, who had long worked with them to establish famous works of art throughout Europe.
The contracts took place and made the artistic work under the establishment of the workplace of the brothers, which then provided for the installation of the customs office.
The summary says that the whole work was very well resolved, both from the half of the Grand Holy Daughter and from Oidtman brothers.
Has it ever stood in the island of weather.
It took Gerd about two years to do the work that was carried out in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the work was completed, only 47 years old.
Prepare transportation of more institutions to land
Onear Dadason’s social minister’s differences proclaim that more public organizations will be transported to the next country.
This was said by a minister in the Post of Explosive at the Wave in the afternoon.
Recently, it was announced that autumn, in the northern part of the Saudárkrok, the House’s and Manufacturing Agency’s burning field will be transported.
Six researchers in the field of burning work at the Agency, but none of them are intended to follow the North Agency and have the National Relations of Availant and Hospital Transporters criticised the farm transport.
“ I think we should take further steps in this creature.
I'm preparing further steps in this creature.
More transport," said Ásmundur.
He is convinced that a large majority of the nation wants to see greater distribution of public institutions around the land.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transport of public works to a country, as I was doing with the House and the Agency for Human Rights," said Ásmundur, who also took examples of other bodies that have been transported to a country and took a great deal of importance for communities in the country, such as transport of Food Agencys to Selfoss, Iceland’s Landmeters to Akraness and jobless security at the Skagastran.
All the most important things from the second Day of Master’s Congress
94. Iceland's Master Congress in Free Sports ended on Torsfield on Akureyri today.
Some congresses were set on the second day of the race.
In 2014, an exciting race was calculated for women in Torsveld, whereas Vigdis John’s daughter from FH set Iceland’s met in the coat, until Elisabet Ruth Runar’s daughter from IR added the assessment in May last year.
In the past summer, Vigdis worked back on Iceland’s valuation and has been in fantasy form, which has improved Iceland’s cost of the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been dealing with harm and has not been accomplished today.
It had only one valid five - cast, 25,69 feet [25,69 m], far from its best.
Vigdis threw the longest today, or 60.08 feet [60.08 m] in her last attempt, and immediately congressed.
In July, her island assessment was 62,69 feet [62,69 m], so she was somewhat from it.
Godrun Karitas Hallgrim’s daughter from IR had the next best cast of the day, which added her best success with a 50.18 feet [50.18 m] throw.
In a male class, Hilmar Örn Jonason, Icelandic meteor, won a safe victory, while he threw 73,84 feet in his next last castle and set an opposition.
His island assessment in the article is 75,26 feet [75,26 m].
Godni Valur Godnason, Olympia, and Icelandic meteor in a circular castle, won a race in a cultivation on Torsfeld yesterday, but today he struggled in a circuit, which is his main section.
Iceland’s Gods Vals is 65,53 feet [65,53 m], which he threw at the longest 59,13 feet [59,13 m] today, and guaranteed the victory.
Valdimar Halt Erlendsson was thrown the most longest today, with one valid cast in the second seat, 49.43 feet [49.43 m].
Havdis Victory daughter, Icelandic meteor in a long - dark, won the long - black race with excellence, but Hafdish jumped at a maximum of 6,25 feet [6,25 feet] today, which is nearly 40 cm from her Icelandic meteor.
For 200 feet [200 m] of the females, the IR, the God - rescue Jonathan Bjarna’s night, who was the biggest in the year of 24,04 seconds, is 23,45 seconds in the article.
John’s God - rescue was victorious in Akureyr, who earned two gold prizes yesterday, 100 feet [100 m] run and 4 x 100 feet [4 x 400 feet] of messengers, and then also in a 4 x 400 feet [400 m] of messengers today.
In a male class, Kolbein Horse of the Gunnar son of FH was the first to mark 200 metres in the 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Oliver Moon Samuel’s son from Aarmann.
Like the God - rescue of Jonah, the Colbean Capits of Gold won at 100 feet yesterday as well as in the 400 feet [400 m] race.
Doesn't make a debt for $27 million bitcoin harvest
The Supervisory Committee has rejected the requirement of a tax investigator who demanded a person guilty for discounting his financial contributions arising from sales on the Bitcoin electricity coin.
The name concludes that a tax investigator had not made clear reasons for the need to blame the man.
The Committee's decision shows that the tax investigator considered the man to be disclosed in the materially wrong tax rates due to the 2016 and 2017 revenue years.
He would have mismatched his financial girls who had come for sale of the Bitcoin electrical coin up to 27 million, either willingly or of awesome inequality.
The man is guilty for his attitude.
So the man rejected in a letter to the committee.
However, he agreed to have sold a electricity coin for 27 million in 2016.
Hana would have been buried in 2009 and 2010 when such things were both easy and indoor with a normal home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electrical coins, the tax execution of such sales would have been significantly unpredictable and unpredictable.
Few people could have been expected to recognize such taxation measures.
He wouldn’t have meant to avoid paying taxes from the harvest, and he would have recognized his property in advance as an intrinsic account.
He would have asked both acquaintance and government tax managers about how this would be done but did not succeed.
Then he thought he had to take into account that he was not born or raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began to dig after Bitcoin.
Thus, he would have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules on which tax authorities would not have drawn a clear view.
The man thought that his taxes for these two years of revenue would be re-determined and stressed, but in other words, they would not be punished.
Then he repeated that he worked in Iceland and would have paid taxes in this country from 2012.
He would never have meant to escape his duties in an improper manner.
The demand for a guilt would be in full and would put him in debt.
“ This man understands what football is, ” a brilliant comments.
The dentist Andersen Willumsson has been considerable between the dentists, but he has also been impressed by his progress, as a result of a time of Breaking in the Pepsi Max department.
When they arrive at the IA in a direct post at Station 2 Sports, a lighter will be in the fireline tonight.
Then a brush takes out a playback because of four reminders in the season, so it does not come to play with new cutting, as in the summer’s games until now.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his pocket for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“ I don’t know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but speaking of the character that it was better to try in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball every time, and if there was someone going to balance this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Godmund Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max girl, when it was considered to be a Brewery.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ Sometimes it’s hard to realize in what position it is.
He looks out a little to the left when it begins to suffer, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Harvar, the son of the sea.
Torkell Moon Petersson says that Brynjólf is a real entertainment, so it is a joy to have such a colorful man in the department: “No one is controversial about this character.
This is a funny type, and I love it with my hair, and always be ready to come and answer at interviews.
Incredibly many people are busy with him, who tells me that this man understands what football is.
“ I am an entertainment force.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
People are reading the interviews at Brynjólf, people are paying in and watching what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moon.
The player KR says he wants to leave the company - "I've been in contact with some teams in the B department"
Tobias Thomsen, player KR in the Pepsi Max department, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish Mediterranean Bold, Tobias is ready to go home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the matter.
Tobias wants to start in the homeland period, but for that, he has to cancel his contract at KR, where the Danish department begins before the Icelandic Chance.
The company knows I miss Denmark and has shown me a great deal of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“I have been in contact with some teams in the B department and will probably change before the end of the Icelandic period.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can allow to pay up my contract at KR."
Then he says that he will likely need to take a reward in Denmark.
“Societies in Denmark have probably experienced more economic impacts of the virus than in Iceland.”
The Wheel Wheel Wheel Wheel Wheel Wheel Bjartmar has recovered for millions - Now responding to a discussion of DV
For more than a year, Bjartmar Leoson has had interests as far as most others are concerned.
He shooks up and saves lost and stolen wheels, electric bikes, and vessels.
Has Bjartmar gained the name “The Wheel Wheel Wheeler” for this purpose.
Yesterday, when a man published a record of his relations with Lightmar, there was so a lot of feathers.
The DV then pointed out in discussions on the Facebook group of western towns, which suggested that Bjartmar took the man to speak in Eastern Territory and said that the web might be stolen.
It was only possible to read from the original writings of the electrical scooter that Bjartmar had thefted him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the original news DV updated accordingly.
Brightmars do not explain what really happened yesterday in Eastern Valley.
Bjartmar said that the victims of electrical clowns have received information that they are truly their electric cockpits.
The information was received by others, but it proved to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I learned from the shooter, causing information that there was an electrical shuttle that had been missed very long and sought.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him prepare for driving on the boot, I decide to chill to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally, I go very well into such a matter, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electrical shelter invited him to show him the confirmation for the bike and called himself to a police officer.
“Yes, great, ” said Bjartmar, “Let's just get this clean. ”
Then the owner of the electric cable proved his own possession of his electric cable and drove.
Later, as reported in the previous news, the right owner of the electrical tape told his story on Facebook.
In this bed of the year that Bjartmar has done this work, he says he can count the times that he came to the edge of people on the other hand.
“ I have had peaceful dealings with the hardest people in Smoking, ” said Bjartmar, indicating that bicycle thiefs are mostly the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, nails, psychotics, and other people that are partly on the street.
“ Such addiction is a hard master, and somehow the next dosage needs to be financed, because, unfortunately, the thief is easy to reach that goal, ” says Bjartmar.
“ My relationship with these people is really so good that I have a lot of good people with me.
There are examples of people taking care of me and then looking for me and helping me with what I'm doing,” he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s relationship with racing people is on courteous notes.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him quits, numbers of wheels, and so on.
Rail thief is a major problem that has not been discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police have even begun to point people to speak to him on the basis of stolen wheels.
Brightness is inconsistent with the previous news transfer of DV and claims not to be any kind of self - proprietary police in personal search for justice.
Asked if he is not now on his throat with his attitude, and whether this is not the primary role of a police officer, Bjartmar certainly says.
“ Of course, the cops have to do this, but the fact is that the cop is simply not doing this.
I've been making a look up the police drive away from a large bunk of stolen wheels.
It is purely said without power in these affairs."
“When the cop is not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can achieve success in this class, then why not? ”
He says that he has achieved so much success in having stolen wheels, that sometimes he runs on his “scooters ” on the street that they just had the brighter wheels they had previously reached.
The time Bjartmar has called for assistance from the police, she has just not come.
“ This is just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the ride wheels to blame, ” said Bjartmar, and it’s a cause for victims of racing thefts to suffer the obsessivity of the police in this case.
The results of Bjartmar are not divided.
Many stories of people can be found thanks Brighter for having reached their possessions to them again.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long lost the number of riding wheels he has returned, but the amounts will certainly run for millions, if not for millions.
There, on the other hand, electrical trails, electric bicycles, and electrical trailers are heavy, but electric bicycles can cost up to a half million.
Brightness is working on a school day, and every weekend he works in a community.
Thus, his cycling search is an unpaid work he does during his leisure.
Life - ears and long shadows
In 2019 there was a great birthday year in the history of Icelandic survivors.
Obviously, the officials had received a reward from the king of Dana all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919, a survival fund was established by officials that eventually became the survival of all officials.
The foundation of the current general wage surplus funds was then laid down by total core contracts on the labour market in 1969, with the provision of a job - related surplus fund with a duty and a complete collection of funds from the beginning of 1970.
So, in 1974, laws were laid down on the basis of these contracts, and the life - ear system continued to improve after that.
The life - earning system of wages was not the only radical change that the 20th century’s work movement led with its core struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been experienced in a similar way in 1955, and the organization gradually received its obligations on the right of sickness and healthcare, real rights of employment, shortening of working time, improvements in housing, and more as much as that.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle, but they were proven to be thought, far more and more prolonged than the increase in wages, which disappeared as hard as the price inflammation that was characterized by the period after war and until 1990 as many remember.
In 1969, the member of the establishment of general life - style treasures was both long and complicated.
Even though the fact that the funds were actually to be owned by a cooperative, the labour movement had to be inclined in the fact that their governments were to be appointed representatives of professionals and councils.
In the next few years after the funds were established, the need for the majority of workers in the government of the funds was often discussed in the organizations of employees, but it never achieved, so we still have the abnormal arrangement that representatives of funds are not in the majority of the governments of the funds.
Article 36 of Law No 129/1997 on the obligation to guarantee the rights of lifekeeping and the functioning of biological funds discusses the investment policy of the funds.
The first figure says that “the interests of a donor’s company should be guided. ”
The Fifth Century also says: “The Award of Life will set moral standards in investments. ”
The shareholders' policy on the Lifeyris Fund include the following provisions, in addition to the above-mentioned legislative provisions:
The AIF is part of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investment, together with many of the largest AIFs and the Western Sea’s and Europe’s Professional Investment Funds.
The rules discuss how the emphasis on environmental and social matters, in addition to good governance, can contribute to achieving the investment performance of the credit collections.
Thus, the interests of investors and the objectives of society are in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those registered in the stock markets, adopt public policy on: maintaining a good governance of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Peace of Value, which has the largest of the land’s funds, has set a ‘ policy for responsible investments’, and there are similar provisions.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest fashion word of the islandic “shadow management. ”
Since the word is new in the matter, it is not hoped that it has been defined, but the following definition now seems to be “most taken ”: Shadow management is when a leader of a class society says in the media that he is going to send the representatives of the company to the governance of the Liaison Fund recommendations or instructions on how to take a position in particular matters.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be disfellowshipped by the first aptitude.
However, if the leader does not take this into the media and is not talking about revelation, it is not “shadow management” because, of course, such interaction is always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about the way he feels “shagger. ”
In the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020, there are two men who have tried to form this definition when it is written.
There are the Hard Eigisson newspapers, and Asgeir Johnsson's bank manager.
The motive of both was found after the book of President Nils Bogason Icelandair had told the company’s intention to terminate the contracts with airlines and flight servants (should them), and Ragnar Tor Ingolfsson, president of the Reykjavik Trade Society, sent them the recommendations to the representative of the company of the Lifeyris Board of Trade Directors not to support the possible purchase of the fund of shares in the company, or they might be deceived.
Later, Bog Nils resigned his decision, and afterward Ragnar Tor went the same way with his recommendations, of course, with regard to Boga’s decision.
Yet, they saw Hard and Asgeir reason to multiply the matter in the Friday newspaper with great words on shadowing, crime, and the need for changes in law.
There was indeed a small due to wonder about a heavy silence, even though the blessed due had been in contact and was soon wiped out.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter itself at the end.
I struck out here before the facts of the laws on a survival treasure that are subject to this matter.
In these cases, governments need to take care of the interests of the councils and have moral standards in investments, and these elements are carried out closerly in agreements between Gildis and the Lifeyris Counsellors, as I mentioned.
Yet, life - earning funds should NOT look only to short - term arbitrations in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy, and it would not be necessary for a long time to judge such things in the past, since a large loan of banks and funds has been carried out to immoral adventures and to the environment, with disastrous consequences.
President Icelandair was evident when he thought that he would wipe out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reduce the well-being of the company in the Icelandic market and weaken its position with investors.
Happily, he saw him and pulled this back.
The time shows whether it is sufficient to allow the company to take account of the investment of mortgage funds in the company.

One of the infected did not take homemeat
One of the three who were diagnosed with the Covid-19 on the land yesterday came to the country from the Eastern Solitaire on July 15, last week, about one and a half weeks ago.
However, he is an islander who is not regularly inhabited here, so he did not receive clear instructions to maintain so - called homemeat after arrival to the country and to go to another show a few days after arrival.
He got negative from the border.
“ But he is in the Icelandic community and is actually supposed to go into it, ” says Kamilla Joseps daughter, a physician in the field of pharmacy and a local physician during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered, you are not automatically proclaimed in the second vision.”
She says that the man could have used the English recording form because he is actually a foreign resident, but because of his connection network in the country as an islander, he should rather have used it Icelandic.
But he didn't realize this.
“ When the ID is not recorded, you need to strive for yourself to come to the second show.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
“ Thus, it is clear that we need to enhance the information provided on this while we find a way to make an automatic preaching system, although Icelandians do not record their identification numbers.
Or to make it somehow clear who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Happyly, though, it is limited to the country’s arrival, even though it is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, a contemporary Icelandic.
Only six of them have been sent to a petition after he was diagnosed yesterday, and they were all in association with him.
They will be shown, but two of them are showing signs of Covid-19 infection.
On July 15, the man was negative from his show at the border.
Kamilla is likely to say that he has recently been infected by the virus that it has not yet been detected in it when the vision was taken on the border.
However, she does not want to exclude that the man has been infected here in Iceland, but does not carry the virus to the country.
“It is not quite possible to say that this is certainly an induced infection because it is a long time since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here like those two who have caused a little wrestling in connection with the sports conventions. ”
It says, though, that it is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
“ It is really very unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but notes that it cannot be excluded until the Icelandic genetic analysis has been reassessed in man.
“If we have a viral depth that has not been seen here before, it is almost safe that he has carried it to the land. ”
Pipars and bombs used against protestants
As a result of conflicts between police and Protestants in Seattle tonight.
The police used pepperspray and illegal handmines, but Protestants broke the rod and ignited.
45 Protestants were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudices were protested in many United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were supported by Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot to death.
As shown at BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of people gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then ignitioned in a building area and broke a rod in the city’s courthouse.
As a result, the police said that the protests were inadequate, and there were conflicts between groups of Protestants and police.
The demand for justice in Aurora, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, at least by Protestants.
A car drove through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one hurts.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of people of black guards gathered together and demanded justice for Breonnu Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman who was murdered by police in their home in March last year.
The team had firearms and went to the county at the closed gate conventions where the police were involved in the group of protesters and also had firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white cabinet in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, council manager Manchester United, does not want to make too much less of the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final circuit of the English electoral department.
If the United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, the end of the sunshine and his men in the 5th seat, thereby losing from the Championship.
However, they should still hope to get to the Master’s Department by working the European Department for the next month.
“ We haven't arrived at the end.
If we get a score against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad period now," said Solskjær.
“ But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, because we still have a lot of land to reach the two lines above us, ” said Solskjær.
It is evident that nerves are going to be ponding at 15 p.m., but Solskjær tried to act as if there were any other game.
“ If you want to be part of Manchester United, you must get used to be under pressure during the last game of the period.
It's nothing new, and it's based on it.
We have made a great opportunity to end the period well, and now it's ours to use it," said Solskjær.
“ This is not the most important game of the period, it’s just the next game.
You can ask whoever is in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The outline does not define our period, we have already had many hours to define this period."
“ The coming of Bruno Fernandes changed greatly for us, and I think we are in a better form and much stronger spiritually than in the last period, ” said Solskjær.

Fearing the Other Waves of the Horse
Spain’s governments are now trying to resist the increased spread of COVID—19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID—19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more reports in one day from the beginning of May, and the newspapers have come at the same time as Spain begins to dismiss one of the strictest bans on exits in Europe.
The relapse led the British authorities to now engage in passengers coming from Spain to take a pathway at home.
A week earlier, Spain was on the list of safe kingdoms in Britain.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the northeastern part of Spain, where governments have taken the broader limits to struggle with growth.
In the capital of Barselóna, entertainment places will be closed in the next two weeks, and agehouses will be closed in midnight.
Now the exit is now in force for 200 thousand inhabitants of the Segria County in the western part of Catalonia.
It is considered that the decision of the British will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which is very reluctant to the arrival of foreign travelers and is badly affected by the epidemic.
Tui, the biggest tourist office of Britain, canceled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Worldwide governments are said to be prepared for the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be to reappear a massive ban on exits that have destroyed the economy in a wide range.
To form, Mr. Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the British, has taken very badly in such a way, similar to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, Prime Minister of France, said that “the nation would not be able to survive, economically or socially, ” if it was again taken to ban the country’s exit.
If it comes to it, many employees are hoping for local resources that will reach inhabitants of individual cities, cities, or regions will be sufficient to keep the virus back in the next round.
Five New Infects in Iceland - Three Inland
In addition to two additional borders, three domestic meats were detected yesterday.
Thus, five people were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infection yesterday in Iceland.
In the report by the generalists, one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football assembly.
Has he been sent into isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in a pathway.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of the idolatry community in Reykjavik and is according to the notification, “only part of the idolatry” in suspicion.
Others who were sent to the petition are related to the man in a different way.
The source of this infection is unfounded and fully infected by the National Police Office.
ReyCUP contradictors have followed the instructions and regulations of the contradictory physician and generalists that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
At the same time, pictures of the assembly were attentive, seeing in a very close connection to rejoicing the good course of their support in the field.
Just before 11 p.m. today, the contradictors published the following notification on their Facebook page.
It says: “Attention: Parents should respect the rules that competitors take their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday but was related to the infection reported last morning.
The report states: “Icelandic genetic analysis has seen the infection and has seen a new type of virus that has not been identified here before. ”
In this case, infection is also performed and is infected in isolation and 12 in infectious causes for the infection.
The third violation of a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was discovered in the southwest corner of the land.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in a pathway.
Two of them are already showing signs of virus meat.
In addition, two were diagnosed at the border and were waited for further studies such as a process of infection at the border.
Finally, the report says: The National Police Office and the National Medicines Office are prone to careful care and care for individual contraceptives.
In the event of the least doubt whether the signs of the Covid-19 virus are present, then the same request is to take a show at the next centre of healthcare.
Patriarch Feather says the tent area booked about a sales saint - Direct guests other
According to the announcement of the western population, the campsite at the Patriarch is fully booked during the weekend.
Guests are indicated to consider other guest events.
It is called the West - Beautiful Bildudal, Thalkfjord, Melanes on Redsand, Hotel complexand, and Hotel Bredavik as a second option in the position.
There is enough to be at the Patriarch of this weekend, for, like the previous year, a Schild City, an icelandic ceremony will be held in town.
It has been maintained since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the city.
As a result of an attempt to judge the tent area, it can be expected that this year, if the weather does not account for a stroke, then DV said earlier today of a prominent prediction.
But may the worst weather be expected southward, and hope for the Pastors.
The web bb.is first reported, and said that all other guests in the city were already fully booked.
A whole multi-building house collapsed to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live freely in Dunhaga 18–20.
While owners are looking for a restructuring permit, their tasks have been successful in the system for a third year.
In one of the oldest, most expensive, and most expensive neighborhoods of the city of Reykjavik, a glorious multibian house is located on three hills.
On the ground floor of the house, there is about 600 square meters of sales space.
The rear house is a door of two steps, each of which holds four rather glorious apartments.
They are between 93 and 130 square meters, but most of them are over 100.
The house has a lot of history.
It was built in 1959 and has included a video camp, the Scoe Room, the Lactation Camp, Joa Gun, Fish Sales, and now last High School Print.
The house has remembered its fiery beauty.
As shown in the accompanying pictures, the house is now under great damage.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 u.v. are according to a company list among others Magnus, the son of Magnú, and the Godrun Holy Daughter of Lárus.
Magnús was the owner of the Payment Group, and he was the defender of the Payment Society.
A group of owners of the Payment Society is a Steelship.
Steelship e.g. is an investment society of the Holy Lady of Lárus and her children.
Godron is also the owner of the third part of D18.
Godrun and her husband, August Godmundur, the son of Victory, robbed once the castle of Stealship.
D18 or more purchased the house in the summer of 2009 and has little that has not been maintained since then.
Says neighbors that the condition of the house has worsened constantly since, though most recently.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood, one inhabitant says that the house has “wasn’t very vivid last years. ”
There may be an indication that the owners have been seeking to change the house and the place for several years.
Other neighbors say that the house has long not been okay.
“ It is long time to do something common to this spot and sadly that it has been pulled like this. ”
In addition, he says that he is incumbent on the owners of the house because he has not been able to finish this, find a common surface with the neighbors of the house, and stop this “legislative stick. ”
“Do this only in consultation with the community around so that it can be accomplished and completed.”
The ‘technology stage’ referred to by the population is the organisational process of the field that has been running at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were searched for an authorization to build a height above the present multi - municipality house and behind the house, a new elevator, and a one - height building, and a basement.
The Building Authorisation granted for this implementation was addressed to the Committee on Environment and Resources and the Committee disregarded it as the implementation was not supported by a divisional system and the local notification was not satisfactory.
Then, in July last year, the city of Smoking took part in organization and finished it with an advertisement in the Governing News.
This organization was also devoted to the Committee to this effect in March 2020.
Thus, at this point, nearly three years were passed from the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house at the beginning of the building.
At that time, the house had suffered considerable downturn, and the neighbors were tired.
When DV asked the neighbors into the condition and reactions of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had a understanding of the purpose of the house’s owners, others did not at all.
Others directed anger to the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but nothing definitely out of anybody.
Others also said the car sites of controversy, but neighbors have new unused car site Dunhaga 18 - 20 under their driving equipment.
One prosecutor in the case said long - tired in the government:
“ That we need to go through the process of triangular is quite incredible.
It's like the city of Reykjavik couldn't read."
Today, the house is empty, left and neglected.
A memorial of the city’s governance and the noble intentions of the owner and many years of work of those who are now in the first place.
When a newspaperman had a garden at Dunhaga 18, he was blowing up a door and a scrap.
Playstation computers and recent televisions were within another waste on earth — victims of an island summer blown.
It was open to the old university print office, and there was a lot of cats of the scent to judge.
It is clear that someone has turned around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and some plates of geography pages, which probably had to become a book, were blown down.
The walks of the apartment were also open and lived in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky to attack the inhabitants of one of them.
It was where the Romanians poured up potatoes at dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians are working for the Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and are asking DV records that the company has paid nothing for the house but heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, it does not seem defendable to obtain rent.
Evidently, the postal position of the house’s indoors is evident that there has been a number of foreign workers in the last missiles.
The company has not been careful about the Covid-19 situation, since the constraints in tourism led to a contradiction in the construction industry and these two sectors were the most effective in the use of staff.
Yet, at Dunhaga 18, homemen seemed to have enough to do, and they hung up the workplaces and the distortions in the share to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be argued that despite the bad condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be finely maintained.
When a journalist called the boys in English, he suddenly became evident in the irony: The best place in Reykjavik is 1,500 square feet [1,500 m] property.
Owners want to change the house to improve, and neighbors want to improve the situation, but discuss the definition of “paids. ”
Between the city’s organisational area, the victims of endless prosecutions and the lovingness of the organisational process and the sweaving release of the Environmental and Resources Committees.
In the house there are such beding workers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelandians stop arguing.
The article was originally published in the DV 17th July.
In response to overweight following the crown virus age
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide 10 million pounds in a battle against overweight, which will include the ban on sudden advertising, as a result of serious illness, partly due to his weight.
In fact, Johnson presents the campaign that has been promised to be better health tomorrow, Monday, but with the trip, doctors are encouraged to prescribe bike rides to their shelters in excess of weight and will also be attacked on the increase in wheelrest.
Then, according to British media reports, advertising on TV will be banned before 21 a.m.
“COVID—19 has raised us against short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become more healthy, more active and eat healthy food,” according to the government's speaker.
Johnson himself has meant gravity problems, but he was put into the vacuum when he was infected by the crown virus in ours, and it is partly to his weight because he is considered to have been so seriously weak.
Women better be able to lead the changes
She said that the new governance system was the largest step that the nation could take to make more power, transparency, and to fight corruption and to the interests of the whole.
“ We need to change a little now, and who is better in order to make such changes than the community’s group that is easier to be in these values.
"There are women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their female collaboration.
Staying together and keeping together in order to lead changes.
So now we're just going to lead these changes."
She said she was a little scary about the emphasis on Iceland as the “best in the world” in both sex and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to see what to do.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and consider everything to do.
It's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from, knowing the story and listening.
Listen to the voices of bordered groups.
We don't all live with the same rules here," said Helga.
She asked women to be in good matters in Iceland in many respects, but she added that, like some else, Icelandians built with a very male value.
She said that politics reversed to form their own interests, authority, and powers, which were the powers of all communities.
“Women have now set up this group and come together and have just become a little irritated about the fact that the General Assembly is going to draw aside this 2012 national voting contribution,” she said.
“ It’s these female values we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and natural protection, cooperation and the fact that we are all really sitting at the same level," she said and added that the above-mentioned values were the basic values of the new governance system.
“ We are a very rich land of natural depression, and it is ridiculous that here are people living with poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can divide different ways," said Helga.
“ It is ridiculous that there is a natural law that women are always less paid.
It is ridiculous that aeroplanes and nurses need to be in a core battle indefinitely just in order to achieve a human wage."

Twenty in pathology and some of them begin to show symptoms of the disease caused by the crown virus
In the last three days, five have been diagnosed with the internal crown virus and most of the infected are unrelated.
Due to this, many of them begin to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed by the internal crown virus yesterday and two at border skiing.
According to an expert at the state physician’s office, the growing number of domestic diseases does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely into society.
“ It has been seriesed from the former domestic disease, and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think it has been secret in society for some time.
This is probably something recently arrived to the country, but of course, we need to be very careful now, ” said Kamilla Sigrider Joseph’s daughter, a physician in the field of pharmacy.
Most of them have been associated with those who came from abroad.
There are more shows in the next, but some who were in contact with the infected have started to show the symptoms of the crown virus.
“ Now there is no influencing, and there is no reason for other respiratory infections, so we can be quite free to do these tests on individuals who had found reason to do something else first during the time of influenza, ” said Kamilla.
It is mostly complete, but it is not excluded that more people need to go into the disease.
Two of the infected were discovered after attending sports events.
Has it raised questions about the defendability of keeping such events.
As long as people follow the standards and regulations, the public’s communication manager says that it is very slow.
Camilla almost excludes the infection of the infected at the sports conventions.
“ If there is no more isolation from these individuals after having interacted with them at these sports conventions, we can claim that our contradictions at the conventions have worked.
But it's not revealed," said Kamilla.
The task of the public defence department is in a continuous review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or limitations if it seems to be reasoned,” said Kamilla.
After more than a week, multidata limits will be cleared up to a thousand.
These new situations may affect relaxation.

Elisha feels very nutritious to attend her daughter early in the school.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to the second part’s exercise.
After training, it is good to come home and just have to warm up the food.

Elisa does not follow any particular diet.
She is putting a final hand on a master’s work in nutrition, so she knows what is suitable to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and exercises.
“ What I can do is eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, hydrocarbons, and fat.

It's okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.

Conflicts between police and Protestants in Seattle
The city authorities of Seattle, Washington, have declared rebellious as a result of numerous contradictions in the central city.
Yesterday, the police used to blow and pepper sprays to tempt a large area that Protestants defeated and stretched over many lengths of houses in the neighborhood of the Congress House in the city.
The police reported on Twitter at least eleven Protestants had been arrested and that the investigation was carried out at a police station in the city last night, possibly with some kind of bomb.
Citizens and police authorities say that Protestants had crushed police with crushing, bottles, crushing bombs and others, and one policeman was transferred to a hospital where he was injured.
However, the protests at Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blow was for them to show Protestants in Portland, Oregon, a consensus, which has repeatedly resulted in harsh conflicts between Protestants and heavy - armed state of federal police.
Like in other cities of the United States, there, people gather under Black Lives Matter, Georges Floyd, who was killed by a policeman in Minneapolis May 25, recalls systematic racism in the American community and demands improvement.
Not revoked until after voting
Still, it is not possible whether the declines of the Icelandair airlines that are to take effect for the next month’s convention will be revoked.
The Icelandair Airlines' Airlines' Airlines for Icelandair’s Electronic Voting Agreement will end tomorrow’s lunch.
Godlaug Líney Johnn’s daughter says that Icelandair will not make a decision on the statements until the conclusion of the vote is made.
“ This is perfectly linked, ” says Gottlaug Líney.
“ No rejection has been revoked; this must be done so that human machines can be made available.
And then, of course, people are unpleasant after getting to know if they're working after the month's assembly."
The vote is on a contract signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is expected to be valid until September 2025 and is based on an agreement previously concluded by airlines.
On 17 July, Iceland’s Government and Confidential Council agreed to proclaim an Icelandair voluntary job stop, and the competitors agreed to vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided after the decision of Icelandair to stop talking to the airline company, to cancel all of its airlines and to look for contracts with another class company.
Then the company’s pilots had to take care of safety teams on board.
Asking how she thinks that the voting payment will go, Godlaug Liney says it is difficult to tell us about it.
“ People are hurt after this operation of Icelandair, when all the airlines of the company were cancelled and announced that the agreement would be made with another class society.
Now it turns out if it has an effect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 airlines worked at Icelandair, and 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their deferral is misleading, with those who have the lowest working life in three months, and then ends at the month meetings of July-August.
There are about 90% of Icelandair pilots.
What does the agreement not accept?
“ Then we wish for a continuous conversation with our advertisers.
With this contract, we meet the requirements of Icelandair.
"If he is rejected, it is clear that the pilots think they have gone too far."
A vote on the core agreement will be concluded and Icelandair will present the second quarter of the year tomorrow
A new core agreement will end at 12 p.m. tomorrow's afternoon.
Icelandair’s recovery for another quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results indicate that the company’s income has decreased by 85 percent from the same period in the past.
On Wednesday, July 22, an electrical agreement on the Icelandic Airlines and the Icelandair Association began, and tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 p.m., ends.
Those who are allowed to choose the contract are Icelandair employees who pay social charges to the airline company.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new core agreement on Sunday 19th, but on Friday before Icelandair had broken conversations with the company after the previous voting agreement at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had told all the airlines and airlines of the company on Friday, but they were pulled back after a new core contract was signed.
According to a new core agreement, airlines need to fly more than five hours a month for the same basic wage.
The core agreement is valid until 2025, where pilots and pilots have been integrated for how long they can fly on one watch.
The contract was presented to FFI’s companions at a meeting at Hilton Nordica’s hotel last Monday and declared a number of airlines discussed by a newsroom on the grounds of dissatisfaction.
However, most people seemed to agree that the agreement to keep FFI alive would be agreed.
Icelandair will be reimbursed for a second quarter of the year tomorrow than the company’s EBIT, its company’s business income for the financial group and taxes, is negative, according to preliminary extractions, about 100 to 110 million US dollars or about 15 billion Icelandic dollars.
Icelandair sent the Buy House the preliminary calculations last Wednesday, where it said that the company’s revenue had earned about $60 million in the quarter or $8 billion.
At the end of the quarter, there were some $21 billion of a hand - hand money and its equivalent.
Icelandair also aims at offering the company’s share funds in August.
Icelandair is going to complete agreements with the fifteen loans, governments, and Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before being partially offered.
New variant rather than new type of virus
“ New virus only means that this has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been painting here in the country," says Már Kristjánsson, supervisor of the National Hospital’s Department of Infectious Disease, saying that “new type of virus” has been reported here in the country.
Three domestic meals were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who had been diagnosed to participate in the social work of the sports community at Rey Cup, the source of the infection unfounded and infectious.
Injury was also diagnosed in a person who arrived in the country on 15 July and two who were in contact with him began to show signs of COVID—19.
Then, yesterday, infections related to infections reported last morning and after the Icelandic genetic analysis, “new type of virus that has not been identified here before. ”
Infection is finished in connection with that infection.
It may be noted that there is no new virus, but that is the same virus that has spread throughout the world, i.e. the new crown virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it meant and if it could say something about the beginning of another wave of epidemics, Mar says that, as a single case, there may be no more out of it.
“But if there are cases in the country that are not related to abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then it would be possible to draw the conclusion [in the second wave], but it is untimely for such support,” explains Mar.
The Happiness of the Hot Pot
Is the secret of happiness hidden in the hot pots?
As a result of BBC's recorders, then, in an entertainable video that sheds light on the pool and hot pot culture of the country.
The Icelandic bathing population is a world - wide special, and it is claimed that nowhere in the world is as many as inhabitants.
The natural earthquake is the basis of it, but also the tradition for distortion here.
In 1940, children were legally trained, but older citizens are still able to use the hot water to improve their health.
Sundry is described as a fixed part of the country’s general welfare.
Everybody in the pot is equal, regardless of the level and position.
On the phones, people talk about their homes and spaces, or enjoying the illustrating power of the water: meditating and loading the electrical loads of the soul and body.
To pick up a hundred days of elections
There are hundreds of days until the Americans go to the elections and choose president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a reselection, but he's got the bar to pick up.
Joe Biden, the prospective prominent group of Democrats, has a great national forum on Trump, is taken into account by the researchers.
According to a new study by the AP, the number of Americans considers that the nation is in the wrong way.
Likewise, Trump’s reaction to the world’s new crown virus is very unavoidable, and more Americans than before believe that the President had disadvantaged economic matters.
In detail, only two of the ten Americans say that the United States is in the right way.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s reactions, and 48 percent say that he has maintained a good economic situation.
In March, it was 56 percent, and in January 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent in the country, but Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his performance to the paterns of Biden, to promote so - called cultural issues, and to proclaim policy that should turn to law and rule.
However, Biden’s procurement makes a great effort to keep the attention of Trump and considers that if the election is really about the way Trump has been working in the last four years, he is likely to be defeated.
It seems that Trump’s adventurous people are also going to come down to the Rebellians and fear Promotors that Democrats may even reach the majority of the United States Assembly’s Assembly Assembly’s Elderly Department, which hitherto has been very freaked.
Politico reported that the day of keeping track of classes and proclaimers would be comparable, and that is now the rebellious class would be the most disturbed for decades.
The district has proved to be particularly bad in the 2016 congress elections, and it is now evident that this development will continue.
Trump has tried to scare inhabitants in the past few days to follow him, including by saying that he will become President Biden, destroy the United States’s outskirts and undermine racial conflicts.
Among other things, Trump has declined regulations from the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase the diversity of abroad.
He then urged “home - mothers ” of the United States to read an article of the former assistant director of New York, who claimed that Biden would destroy the United States districts and took Trump under it.
“ Prayer will destroy your neighborhood and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!" said the President.
Inhabitants of the United States are a growing group of electorates.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was reselected in 2004, the prosecutor who has received most votes in this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney received most votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
Research has shown that, despite Trump's guaranteed a small majority in the district of 2016, his follow-up has been significantly convergenced.
Although there are differences between the tests, Biden has been measured by about 15 percent of Trump’s predecessor in the past.

Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the gangs?
After the final decision to suspend the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have declined to date, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Fire would be “the light at the end of the walks, ” where the world’s inhabited crown virus is expected to go through.
There are years to prepare, and Japan’s authorities have added costs for the delay.
However, everybody's head ends up a lot.
When announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the site of the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese representatives’ joy was real.
They cried and laughed for a lot, because Tokyo had been seeking to hold the games in 2016, but it ended up in a lower way for Rio, Brazil.
This time, Tokyo City and Japan attended the world’s attention.
The games were to go on July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for years, starting on July 23, 2021 and ending on August 8.
If you cannot keep the games, if the crown virus becomes too threatened, then the games will be stopped.
Yet, no one wants to think to the end.
Olympic games are not a normal sports race.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be wonderful and seeking to top the last game.
Selected on a city for Olympic Games is based on the assessment of the election committee on the presentations of the cities.
The magnificent the presentation is — the more likely to get the nose.
Tokyo required $150 million to try to hold the Olympic Games in 2016 or over $20 billion.
The second time, when the games were applied for in 2020, $75 million, $10 billion, were put in the presentation.
In 2013, when Tokyo was decided to receive the plays this year, the Japanese authorities had then spent $30 billion for the project.
However, this amount is only a drop in the sea in terms of how much it takes to build Olympic villages, stages, and generally strengthening the country’s interior in order to cope with such conventions, to prepare it, and to keep the plays itself.
Planners in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which should have been ongoing these days but have been suspended for one year because of the crown virus, would cost $12,6 billion.
However, a report by a reconsiderer in Japan, which came out last year, showed that the cost was more than twice that.
It is likely that the cost of deferring the games will not be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
Thus, the total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could run between $15 and $30 billion.
There are so high figures that all taxpayers in the Icelandic State only served about half the Olympic Games, depending on the lowest possible cost.
Olympic games are an event of the magnitude that they have often become an accounting material of economicists who are trying to make figures and view the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest sense, many have found that the impact of Olympic Games is less positive for the economics of those who hold them.
A short - term effect, for example, is a large number of jobs to a short time, but for a long time, cities tend to sit up with debt rates and threatening the cost of smallly used humans.
Rio, Brazil, has suffered serious debts because of the 2016 games and has been in trouble with the maintenance of all the big sports players built for the games.
After the games in London in 2012, only 10 percent of those who received jobs related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
This means that no new jobs were considered except in a small amount.
In general, cities have not come very well out of financially holding Olympics because of the lower cost of the human beings that are built for the games.
However, the benefit is often included in an increased traffic of travelers who want to visit the Olympia cities following the games, which is, however, very uncertain about the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether all of the audiences who usually have to play can be accepted.
However, the main issue is the honor that the cities have to be elected, but it is hard to appreciate for money.
Despite the enormous cost, the joy of the games may also be said that it is not of nature worthwhile.
But although the show is often magnificent and there is no saving, this is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes in the front.
For some performers, it is surprising just loving to postpone the games.
In her article on the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, for example, the Australian five - stepped woman and the Gold Prize Harbour, who had been far from a good age in summer, has the hope of being in competition for the 2021 games.
So it is among the sportsmen who are just rather happy with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those sportsmen who were planning to stop after the games this year, if they had been held at the right time, the delay of the games in some cases means that they stop competition before the players take place.
Just do not trust your body to go through a year of further tough exercises.
Few athletes found themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 and the Simone Biles fiction star.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been interviewed in his home country in the United States in the past to talk about the Olympic Games.
She intends to play 2021, but she's not necessarily sure that she can still be at the top of the games next year, and then she will be 24 years old.
Although it is not generally considered a high age, it is higher for a female female in the first row.
“This is a sensitive matter,” says Biles, but smiles at another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee asked if she was going to reach as long in the 2021 games as she did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’m still on top after a year in addition to exercises, ” says Biles.
She has previously mentioned that her body is no longer tolerating the stress that is associated with physician training.
Yet, she is exercising for the Olympic Games 2021.
Biles admits that it was uncomfortable to have a sudden stop to practice when the world’s death was the highest and the funeral was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles more than others during all sports operations were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic Gold could not buy any access beyond the other; she had to find some ways to keep herself in shape, as others did.
Surely, make a little better than most people.
“ We have a rigid plan now.
It was hard to start retraining first after the opening of the gym.
We started slowly, but I've been back in full, and I will increase my exercises all the time according to what is going on in the year.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we do not know if they are to be.
I've done too much to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With her, like others, doubts or maybe rather conscious that the situation can arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
However, predicting this is hopeless.
No one can know how the state of the world’s crown virus will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games as they will be held a year.
Maybe the Olympic Fire will be the light at the end of the Covid gangs.
Delayed wedding due to epidemics
The modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to suspend her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette of Well Adam's competitor this summer.
“ I think there are other more important things to think about accurate now, ” said the actress in a conversation with People.
“ We really want to marry sometime, and we have the dream breakdown and have all those who are in love with us.
Yet, we decided to take it on a delay and focus on what is important now, and we are helping to share information about the importance of being with masks and keeping at home.
I'm looking more at the world than wedding these days.
There's a lot going on, and we should focus our attention on what's happening in the world."
