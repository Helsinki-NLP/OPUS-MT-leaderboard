AM in Wales is worried to "come as a puckon"
Some AM, members of the National Assembly of Wales, are confused by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal will, according to plans, change the name of the National Assembly to the Wallis Parliament.
AM throughout the political spectrum is worried about being ridiculed.
A AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it's rimping with Twp and Pwp."
For readers that can't walesic: Twp means stupid in walesic and pwp means bajs.
A AM for Plaid said that the group was generally "displeased" and has proposed other options.
A conservative waleser said his group is "open" for the change of name, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is expressed in Walesian like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
Assembly Commission, currently compiling legislation for the change of name, said: "The final decision for what members of the congregation should be called is so clear to the members themselves."
Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Wallese congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the result of a public consultation on the proposals, which found a strong support for calling the House of Wales Parliament.
The current title of the AM proposed the Commission Welsh Parliament Members (Members of Wales) or WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM clearly proposes other options, but problems with reaching a consensus may cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislative framework for the amendments also includes other amendments to the functioning of the congregation, including rules for discrimination of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what they should be called when they debate legislation.
Macedonia shall carry out a referendum amending the name of the country
On Sunday, the electors shall vote if they are to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is an attempt to conclude a dispute that has been taking place for decades with the neighbouring country Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to join the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, is opposed to the referendum on the change of name and has said that he will ignore the result.
However, the referendum's adherents, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem face problems
"Older people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's neither nor."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People are associating in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Bars aren't like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis."
He is worried that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as far as the leaders are waiting for and that "before or later they get on the box one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with ownerships filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to all the churches being closed, because those who move into the apartments will probably not be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's one decade later.
The original white methodist assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a bojkott of shops at 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or transport black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson’s congregation planned the renovation, they also built the clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and follower at St. Martin's, called the proud music game for "the poor's clocks".
The expert who played the watch game in July had a different name for it: "A cultural tax" and "a incomprehensible historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the bigger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of St. Martin's in recent months are a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs – some who have been employed by the church's game, others of the episcopal foundation.
The churchman – the governing body of the congregation composed of games – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed anxiety for the foundation to "try to transfer the cost" to the church meeting, even though the Chamber had not been involved in the foundation of hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Hai damages 13-year-old dying after lobsters in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and damaged a 13-year-old boy dying after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and poured there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a hummer, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been biten!"
"I've been bited!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the entire key legs had been broken up.
"I cried to all to get up from the water. "There's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was flying to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is reported to be critical.
It's unclear what shark it was.
The Bath Guard Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 hajards in the area, but that most people are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's joins Britain's Beauty Market
Sainsbury's takes care of Boots, Superdrug and Debenham's with shopping-like beauty halls with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK's beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty halls will be tested in 11 shops across the country and implemented in more shops next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the quick buying efforts to fill the shelves previously taken up by TVs, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's said they're going to double their beauty offer to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offers from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with selected areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The shop chain also restarts its boutique smoking mark so that most of the products are veganian – as ever more young customers require.
In addition, the perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test the stand in two Sainsbury shops – the first position opened in Croydon in south London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying smaller quantities of food every day in local stores means that fast buying needs to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their shops will look more and more like a warehouse in an attempt to fight cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of shops and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which, according to them, has increased the sale of food and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the quick purchase to give the beauty and pharmaceutical departments a facial lift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute on how the revenue from Boots sales in the fast purchases would be distributed.
The new strategy will be after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 shops to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended offer of luxurious skin care products, including the marks such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial boss, said, "We have given our beauty halls a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can provide advice to customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth places, we are now a attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "rassing" after Holly Willoughby pulls out of deal on £11 million
Dragons The Star Peter Jones is "rassing" that the TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his life-style mark to focus on its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby can't reach with their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons The Star Peter Jones angry by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle mark in the last minute – to focus on its new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became "rassing" at an excited meeting at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite announced that her new contract – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Activity has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she left Truly at Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly the primary priority of Holly.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to get out of here shocked everyone involved.
No one could think it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a store full of goods ready to be sold at Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that this Morning representative's decision to withdraw may cost several millions of the company due to significant investments in everything from cushions and lights to clothing and the risk of further delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother-in-law Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as President of March.
The couple holidays together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said yesterday night, "We don't comment on his business."
Hard talk, and we got dear.
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "inferior to a president" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a "new prosecutor vote":
"I haven't given up."
He said that Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been fixed.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho said to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "comparable response" from the United States after the first disarmament step of North Korea.
He noted that, instead, the United States continues penalties intended to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's really good with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve relations with Kim has resulted in positive results – an end to rocket stars, liberated the hostages and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10 000 people trying to enter this full-packed scene we would have about 200 people here," said Trump and pointed to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroys island in Indonesia, hundreds of people die
After the earthquake on Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lomboks population had lost their homes, an exceptional permit was not released, which is required for international assistance.
"In many cases, they have been very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which complicates it all," said Ms. Sumbung.
Saved children gather a team to go to Palu, but it's still unclear if foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the natural catastrophe agency, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Given the constant earthquakes of Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the anger of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastal lines.
The lack of a tsunami warning in Palu, even though a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's wearing infrastructure in its election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and train rods.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr Jokos administration in the next year's elections.
Mr Joko is also pressed by quarrying sekteristic tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs struggled on the streets with makeets, arrowbows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge ride in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target in 89th minute in Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's target when his law was 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left, and he scooped a kick against the remote chair.
The attempt fled high over the target area towards the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over the hope of Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended online.
"I just tried to end in a position to access the ball and players like Shaq always play as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach and didn't think so much about it, but just kicked."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half game after a measure for 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker hooked a passport back to Mateo Kovacic, spinned by near the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick donation and go at the middle field.
Then he got a sovereign kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defence and got the ball on the net at the remote chair with a left-foot kick passing Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at the Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is opposed to Videoton in Uefa Europe League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
The death figure for tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death figure for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency early Sundays.
Many people were reported to have stuck fast in the wastes of buildings that broke in the earthquake of 7.5 which took place on Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, said the Agency’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with breads from buildings that broke.
The police are arrested, 32, suspected of murder after the woman is killed
A murder investigation has been started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with knife wounds at Grayson Mews at John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspicious of murder.
The police have asked people in the area that saw or heard something to come forward.
Criminal inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have videoed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is essential for our investigation."
A spokesman for the police has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is in progress and the police will inform the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can come in or go out of the building.
He became targetless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it takes several hours before they can enter again.
A police officer told a man that the whole area was treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared in the place.
She says "it's so terrible" again and again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the block and another right outside.
A number of police assistants were in the block with an overview of the apartment building.
Persons with information are requested to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's recent victims of disputes on the rewriting of history
A banner would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion for "drath" and "try to write about history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said, "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the English civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Wrong Cromwell might be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the views of the 18th century about and is part of historiography for a man that many thinks still should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchin.
If this is a proper representation, it is subject to a ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 16th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person representing one side of the matter.
His business as Lord Protector also deserves to be celebrated and celebrated.
Killing pig kills farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in Southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, which is only identified by his surname Yuan, found death with a breast species and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder is ready to inject vaccine in pigs in a pig path on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan in Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning afterward, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a swine path nearby was open.
He said there was a big grissane in the pork with blood on his mouth.
A judicial investigation confirmed that the 250 kilograms of heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the site.
Yuan's family and the market responsible are reported negotiations on compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and gave the man serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a 300 pounds [300 pounds] pig pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten up by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can function as a "catalysator".
"They're just playful.
They're naphsing and very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The rest of the orchestra Rosa for extensive heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, the orchestra Rosa becomes weaker when it travels over cooler waters at the north coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwest USA in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST in Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a tree begins to form the Pacific Sea and travel eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching tray will create extensive heavy rain in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous flooding, leather flows and possibly earthquake in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5 to 7.5 cm rain per hour in certain places, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm rain is expected in some places in the southwest of the United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorated conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone gets out in the desert to the foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavily rain can make canions exploding rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds that blow around sand.
The nearing tray brings some locally heavy rain into parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of more than a cm rain, which can lead to leather flows and tail roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rain period.
Some shined tropical rains will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will be spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue during Wednesday.
October can imply intense temperature changes throughout the United States when the Arctic is cooled down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in Central USA on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of central and eastern USA are expected to get a warm start on October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeastern USA.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great chance for warmer temperatures than the average in eastern USA during the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaughs interrogation
Over 20 million looked at the Thursday's arresting witnesses from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that should have occurred in the 1980s, on six TV networks.
Meanwhile, the political state of death continued and the normal broadcast was cancelled for Friday's last minute twist – Arizona's senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI, where they got a week to investigate the accusation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh took her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said that he is absolutely sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that on Friday, the number of viewers was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks showing the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people looking from offices.
Similarly, there are as many viewers as for a football game in the end game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presentators have demonstrated a strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day gathering, according to Nielsen.
ABC had almost 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Office of the Republic issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS demonstrations who screamed at him when he tried to take a lift for an interrogation with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators screamed at him, which was shown in direct consignment by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he tells the country the truth?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the lift doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the Committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted if they would carry on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the whole Senate.
But Flake said he'd only do it if the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated in the next week, which the minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterward, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a great impact, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched a FBI investigation about the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of Britain and to undermine the interest of the nation in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should collect each other's customs charges was "fullly unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspected Dyteon Simpson for the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect of the death shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basket player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
The police found the glasses on the site and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After interrogating with Simpson, the police said he admitted that he shot Wayde.
His castle was fixed to $350,000, according to Advocate.
The judicial physician in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shot wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police's refugee force, the state lawslab of the police, the police of Southern University and the inhabitants of the region for help in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flite and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meters long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basket for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basket trainer Will Wade said that the team was "crushed" and "chocked" by Waydes' death.
"You're worried about this all the time," said Wade.
The volcano asks ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned in Saturday mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The Centre discovered several moles and shells.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noticed increased activity in the volcano that stands 72 km southeast of the capital since a earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police hits together with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independent vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence demonstrations hit together with demandall police while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonian polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by Kraallpolis cast eggs and colour powder on them, leading to dark pond clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Slags also broke out later during the day, and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independent groups called "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists cried "length life in Spain".
14 people were treated for less damage caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The atmosphere is still excited in the region that longs for independence one year after the referendum of the first October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was delighted by Catalan separatists.
A overwhelming majority voted for independence, but the participation was low when most people who were opposed to the secession bojkotta the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were damaged in violent collapses last year when the police tried to stop the vote at election stations in the region.
Individual groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the protest of the separatists with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will be independent.
"We experienced one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying out of joy to be able to vote, but now we've been stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for independence have had a difficult time to keep the driving force up this year, when many of their most well-known leaders live in self-demand exile or are in captivity of the trial on their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests to support the police on his mobile phone, said that the conflict had been celebrated by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more excited," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been arrested since the end of last year, announced that he is going to be able to vote next year to the European Parliament.
"Candidate to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the undercutting experienced by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A brush may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured the profit
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt’s side was divided two with Hibernian.
Gerrard's page has still not received a remote win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before then, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes the European League on Thursday.
Livingston extends its profit range to six matches – the main trainer Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against cross visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead long before they made goals; their prosperity gave Ranger all possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but slept his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot widely after having glided in to measure Craig Halkett's nicking across the target.
The home team pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, as they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free park and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which made targets from the centre of the target area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was inevitable and the target guard Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a salvation from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers target guard Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings came into Livingston's target area and were handled without problems. Two criminal requirements – after Halkett's challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one for hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phänomenal showing and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed the expectations on the road upwards.
Their style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defence, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the whole.
But Rangers missed inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold the measure – they only opened the home page once – and it is one of a wakelock for Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday invited the smile and blue sky (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany at the breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become inappropriate with human rights, freedom of pressure and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 observers from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many adherents gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also heard their votes and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duplicating protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero of certain German Turks and is condemned as an enemy ruler of others.
Deptford roads: Cyklist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died in a crash with a car in London.
The rock took place near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-operated road in Deptford in southeast London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurses were called there, but the man died on the site.
The crock takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infectious accident at Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crock on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his closest family.
Roads have been locked off and buses have been redirected and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards damaged in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in trouble at a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The worries broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST in Sunday and still running.
Specialized "tornadovakters" have been called there to deal with the anxiety, which involves eight prisoners on a fly.
The guards were treated in place for worse injuries in the face.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Especially trained prison staff have been sent there to manage the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be addressed to the police and can receive increased penalty."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in hospitals after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, demandall police were called to prison to deal with serious concerns where staff were attacked with bilird balls.
The orchestra Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week when the remaining energy of the orchestra Rosa moves over the desert in the southwest of the United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a twin that only "too tropical cycles have maintained status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 65 km from Arizona's border."
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwest of the United States, including central rocky mountains and Great Basin, probably receive 2.5 to 5 cm rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without risk of sudden floods, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing, as the region is affected by drying.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the Southwest United States suffers from drying.
According to U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffer from at least extreme drying, the next highest category, reported weather.com.
The orchestra Rosa will first travel over Baja California island in Mexico.
Rosa, still with worm force in Sunday morning with a maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and traveling north for 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to be the land mass of Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico may get heavy rain, which presents a significant risk of flooding.
"Council 7.5-15 cm rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north over Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very strong rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwest of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening floods and leather flows in the desert, as well as soil scraps in mountainous terrains.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for murder attempts
Three teenager boys and a 20-year-old man has been arrested suspicious of murder attempts after a 16-year-old found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found damaged in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police ask everyone who might have filed what happened to the mobile phone to come out.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, badness, anger" from the democratic party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the respectlessness of the democratic party and harmless tactics," said Trump to his followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "of evilness, anger" from the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the assembly on Thursday and denied strongly and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he was sexually committed to her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his accusation before the Congress.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skillful legal senses of our times, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his followers in the audience of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of republikans voting in the next mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of our most important choices.
I don't know, but I candide," he said.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "resist and prevent".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of climbs
At least 384 people died, many were swallowed away when gigantic waves crashed to the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to Saturday’s authorities.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters of high waves crashed to the beach in the sky and swayed out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
Tsunamine came after a earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victims of tsunamin," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesien disaster agency GDP, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamine was not alone without dragging cars, stocks and houses. It hit everything in its way," said Nugroho. He also said that tsunami had traveled on open sea for up to 800 km/h before the hit coastline.
Some climbed into trees to escape tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Flight photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Afterscalve still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The row of earthquakes was felt in a region with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake in Friday was 200 times as large as the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bough, which may have made tsunami larger, according to the Agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the bread of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were damaged and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and harms may be even worse along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, a area called Donggla, which is closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," said Nugroho.
"It lives over 300 000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
On Saturday, the Agency was criticized for not having informed that tsunami had been struck against Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top of a building is hearing creeps of frenetic warnings about tsunami to people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water crashes to the beach and sweats away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami led to an extensive stream interruption that interrupted all communications around Palu, which made the rescue work for the authorities difficult.
The military has begun to send cargo flights there by means of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in a great need for food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for the assistance work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from World Vision in Donggala have taken to Palu, where they are looking for protection under presses on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the road, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance groups have started the bitre assistance work, but some complained that foreign assistance workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, necessities and non-resident staff may only be used if exemption permits are disclosed after a disaster.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say that it is a national disaster, we can release international assistance, but that status has not yet been revealed."
When the second evening fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, family and friends of missing people were still hoping that their close and dear would prove to be the miracles that illuminate the distress of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was saved from a cloak.
On Sunday, the rescue workers saved a woman who was stuck for two days with her mother’s body next to herself.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the National Monitoring Team of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing screen pilots in front of Asian games, which ended in Indonesia before the month.
Others attached to Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mondayi, were his students.
"As the screen flying veteran, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the hours after the screen pilots heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages only got a gray goat, instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26.750 during banking at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thiefs stole $26.750 from a Brink's employee who filled on a banking room at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The driver of the car had empty a banking room in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said criminal Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, "a different man jumped up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that would be delivered.
The Witnesses saw several suspected flights from the site, according to the press release, but the police did not specify how many involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders shall contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper changes name to Ye
The Rapper Kanye West changes name – to Ye.
He announced the rename on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The being that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41,has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of its eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who, according to the program's creators, set up for "sensitive reasons".
Ye is a abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio values Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to only Ye – a mirror of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of those we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who have changed names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously cooperated with West, has previously written his name with and without binding lines and case letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reward against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Armies fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 600 people during an era when left-right student movements hit root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double AI financing
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the sum they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment will be made after several parts of the U.S. Government has made statements on AI, although the United States does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming leader in AI innovation before 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
A double-sized budget can double the chance that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier a week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that hit the highest ranked American Othello player, and later he was headed for Microsoft Research and was CEO of the Google China department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government, as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next would be to identify future visionars.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funds from the government, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
"I think the green cards should be automatically offered to doctors within AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides appropriations to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other authorities organisations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Previously this year, the US Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia's Referral on Renaming
The people of Macedonia voted Sunday in a referendum on the change of the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would solve a decade of old dispute with Greece which has prevented the country from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north is a requirement in its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change of name would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts if the minimum participation of 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The question on the rolling part of the referendum is: "Are you for membership of the NATO and the EU with approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the adherent of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claims that it is worth renewal if it makes Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was divided, belonging to the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the paraply of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they are going to follow the result for it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the State election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13.00 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered votes voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum of Macedonia on the name of the country, which would open the way for membership of the NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small stage and place of chairs in front of the tents set up by those who bojkott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join our head in the air, not smuggling through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asiatic integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, a membership of the NATO would lead to necessary investments in Macedonia, with an unemployment of more than 20%.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote yes, because more than 80 percent of our inhabitants are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said a "Yes" result would be a "confession of our future."
According to a survey published Monday by the Macedonian Political Survey Institute, between 30 and 43 per cent of the votes voted in the referendum, which falls under the minimum participation required.
According to another study conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants thought to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them were going to vote yes.
In order to count the referendum, 50 per cent of registered voters plus one vote must be voted.
If the referendum fails, it becomes the first serious deadline for the Westernly focused government policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero takes over the whole Brighton defence to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling hit Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's win at 2-0 at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he made targets for the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a passport from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out to the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green trees.
He went around a defenceman and ran from several others at the edge of the Brighton destination.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used its first kick in the target area to return the ball to Aguero, which used the right foot to hit Brighton's target guard Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about he'd play for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was making targets at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial acquisition in the Premier League battle.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton revir on that game.
He sent a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the remote chair.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball in the net the moment before it ended out of range.
City meets Hoffenheim in the team game in the Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the end game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance for the final game.
Rockies got a wild card place with a profit of 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but is still looking for its first division title.
"We don't play anything, but we can get a chance to snatch the rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not announced their beginning for Sunday yet, but reports suggest that they let Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, heated up in the bullet on Thursday and would throw on his normal vilosday.
Washington's right-handed caster is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 in this season.
Trump holds talks in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about the importance of republikans voting in the next midterm elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks from one of our most important choices.
This is one of the big, big... I don't know, but I candide. That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happens here and now.
They are determined to take the power back whatever is required, you see their evilness, terribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We won't let them get it."
Democrats, he said, struggle to "resist and prevent."
"You've seen that in the last four days," he said, "the Democrats are arrogant and bad and terrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was addressed by the high-building of the observers.
"Do you remember what she said?
'Do you leak the document?'
'Eh, uh, huh?
No, not, no, no, I'm waiting for a ...'It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last one in a series of MPs from Labour who will hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she was opposed to antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about the security of the nation, about Europe – ironically probably similar subjects for which Jeremy criticized former leaders.
The Communication on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be welcome and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But, unfortunately, many meetings are not that, and the promise of "friendlyer, closer" policies has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It has become more and more evident that deviating opinions are not tolerated within Labour, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leader accepts it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues, as I thought before, had a similar political view as I expected I would make a whole reverse and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed – whether the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn't matter what I say – I follow a tired of uncertainty on social media that requires me to be disposed of, criticize my policy and say that I shouldn't even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments that are addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they are faced with a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments with this era's policy is the level of insults that are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
However, in reality, we are no longer this broad church and with every misbelieving and changing the selection rules, the party becomes more and more tight.
I have been given a lot of advice for the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so "it's going to be."
But that's not why I became politician.
Since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by thatcher’s government’s neglect that literally brought my primary school’s classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as government minister.
I've never hide my political views, and it includes the latest choice.
No one in Nottingham East may in any way have been confused over my views on policies and subjects where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To you who promoted the work on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country goes against a Brexit that will harm households, activities and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leader.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electorate – both Labour members and others: I am proud of serving you and I promise that no number of threats to dispose of me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unloaded Ayr on top
Two trials in the last minute may have distorted the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful entertainment Tentent's Premiership match.
They're now on top, the only unmarried side of the ten.
Finally, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the profit, and the trainer Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our matches so far and are still unfounded, so we are so clearly happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the leadership but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which was released by Warriors for the game, let Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot did an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he made points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait after a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the restart Ayr increased the management again with an attempt from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have tackled Climo without the ball made McPherson a touch down from the penal line-out behind Ayr's mouth.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game Star seems ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been indicated as CEO for a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays in together with his long-term co-mediary Greg Hemphill.
Duon has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and the Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment, but a source of Scottish Sun suggested that the Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "blomst-strong restaurant industry".
"Haven belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the Court will open the road to the Pacific Sea again
Seemen patrol a rigid highquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
Flottan's bases from the Titicaca lake to the Amazon's bearing the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It's our duty to recover it."
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastal line that was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong – and it is also the longing to return to the Pacific Sea.
This hope is higher than in decades now when Bolivia is waiting for a decision by the International Court of First October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a atmosphere of unity and peace, and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decisions of the International Court on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court of Hague will judge to the benefit of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to have their own outlet to the sea.
Monday's decision also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's carismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-electives next year.
"We are very close to return to the Pacific Sea," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analytics believe that it is incredible that the Court judges to the benefit of Bolivia, and that not much would change even if it did.
The United Nations Court, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to allocate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision was announced only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have been damaged rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has hurt Chile's remaining welwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Before this President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not consider that the decision of the Court had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "a great opportunity to start a new era for relations with Chile" and a chance to "set a stop for 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America – used the question of the sea as a political cricket.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Sea," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we have to go on from the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament requires confidence in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not defeat its nuclear weapons only if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He invited the United States to fulfil the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rivalising leaders.
His comments came when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be at the border to solve the death situation of nuclear weaponsiplomatin more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "worn dream" to continue penalties and the US protests against a statement of ending the Korean war will ever tempt North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree with the statement without Pyongyang initially initiating significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump of the United States want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism against the fact that Pyongyang really intends to get rid of a arms arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion views reveal the latest line of huge main property on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of crushing, over-dimensional headlines for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blown the style icons in the Paris fashion week.
Unbelievable unpractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designs have sent away their incredible creatures on the catwalk.
Valentino’s principal creation was an excessive beige hat with a feather-like width of hats that totally took over the heads of the models.
Other over-dimensional accessories included jewel-produced water melons, a magic hat and even an ananas – but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had togethered lips and similared Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature likened a wet suit with snorkel and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass trunk.
And if you continue the huge courage, you're lucky.
Mode experts predict that the huge hits may be on their way to shops near you.
The over-dimensional hats come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a 60 cm bracket that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark that was behind the incredibly unpractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another large creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathroom as held in it.
The Raffia bag in the terracotta, with raffinas and a white leather handle, was excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris fashion week.
The sensestylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer – the designer has had such a great impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for overdimensional accessories."
John Edward: Language skills crucial for global citizens
Schottland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other social commitments.
With up to 30 000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement customized learning plans, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and demanded subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we can not only trust in English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are top of the list, with the maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final test Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of the Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills as children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages like topic choices are now considered as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and beyond.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills 2014 concluded that for various reasons employers had a difficult time to fill their vacancies, with 17 per cent as a result of a lack of language skills.
In this regard, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future career.
With increasing jobs in the future that require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a advantage of competition.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult British published by YouGov 2013, 75 percent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that totally came up in a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
To be able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find a meaningful job in the future.
In Scotland each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK before 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future is.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish young people.
Il faut bee le faire.
John Edward is Head of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron does Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James do debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's playing has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweetted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier a week, James was asked for his plans for Lakers' seasonal schedule.
"I don't need seasonal games in this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign events, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is doing his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In waiting for a confirmatory vote of its candidate to the vacant post of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the future intermediate elections, as the Republicans risk to lose control of the Congress before the current election in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you view it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are planned until 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's hearing by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited for debts about his sexual abuse, with a expected delay in the vote from the Senate of up to one week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November election.
Thus, President Trump said that this next week's five conventions aim to " engage volunteers and adherents when the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of the Senate and the Representative House", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman of the Trump campaign who did not want to be named Reuters.
The night's events, planned at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage units in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate Candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been looking after in the opinion surveys.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come there to try to give him an increase in the opinion surveys," says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Clearer Cup 2018: Team USA struggles to keep the hopes alive in front of Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, the party competitions could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The moment's turning pendel is a completely invented sport concept, but something that the players really believe in, and more than ever before competitions like these.
So what momentum is it about now?
"They had a six-point line and now it's four, so we're wearing it as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he ended for the day.
Europe, of course, has four points of advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have little wind in the sail, but they have much to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points of four each.
Spieth has been wash from tea to green and has preceded with a good example.
The vineship was scaling more than higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive put to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had left behind with two after two games.
His putt that won them the match at 15 met with a similar wrath, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deeply and worry about your own match," said Spieth.
It's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes for victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cups inconsistent story.
Europe's odd but beautiful couples are four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bookey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bookeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the audience's reactions make it clear that they are the players to turn on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Especially both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning fireball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they never even came near to get out.
On Sunday, however, no one helps you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to look closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can be changed in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant leadership before the last day, but this four-some session also showed that the United States team has a struggle that some, especially on the side of the United States, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out of Saturday's fireball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 line across the United States.
The inspired duone Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a camped Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, who struggled to keep the pokal they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American law that never really started during the morning's fireball with 3-1.
The United States offered more opposition in the foursome and won two matches, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the pokal.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, baptized to "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in fireball, they hit an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who struck through two matches on Saturday, showed samples of a few moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fireball and foursome, and of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's fireball and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 winner over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe had no winds all the way, but it was a nice, blue day just southwest of Paris.
The three-fold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fireball and returned later to hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, a team has come back from a defect of four points in the single matches, but Furyk's side only needs an unequivocal result to keep the pokal.
After being next the best for two days, it looks like an attack on Sunday may be difficult to get through.
North Korea says they "never" will defend unilaterally without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened their distrust against the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that in the last year, North Korea had undertaken "decisive measures to show its welfare", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, decombining nuclear test installations and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not, however, see any corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally disarmament ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a approach divided into stages of the nuclear power that would lead to the reward of North Korea when it gradually took steps, his statement seemed important, because it did not reject a single nuclear solution just as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting American President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work against "the settlement of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korean security.
North Korea has searched for a formal end of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantulate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected negotiations to facilitate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"USA insists on "development first" and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even objects to the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri says.
"The consciousness that sanctions can get us on knees is a wish dream for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued penalties deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans at a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the leaders of the United States highlighted in the United Nations earlier during the week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the party in this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the Core Islands nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a dead state."
Still, the tone in Ri's speech was dramatic different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the future ability of North Korea to reach the United States' continent with rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketer" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "unruly destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take measures for disarmament, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmned.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months," it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The maintenance of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without failure until we achieve a complete, final, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the penalties against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not work well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later for setting "passing-like requirements".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to unmount a missile plant and also a nuclear force complex if the United States took "comparable measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "comparable measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moved against normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University has led all doctors to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "dyking".
A academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often unreasonable about the foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first in his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after having talked about the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
"At the end of it a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the weight of sleep -- which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students suffered from serious sleep shortages during the week.
The hourly course covers a series of interactive data.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, gardins, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep shortages and the weight of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students directly.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The proud culture of "dying" still exists, he says and added that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on the students meant that sleep shortages were a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapons" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because sleeplessness puts the brain in starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology, helped professor Czeisler to design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral doctors to complete a similar study programme before they start their studies at the High Performance Institute.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for when to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn in the day, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas targets lower Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's inequal side to a 1-0 downlay team in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking for taking home its first victory on the road since February 4-1 triumph on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never managed to smooth out the result.
While Rangers now falls down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and is only behind the Hibernian on target difference.
And there may be more problems for Rangers after the liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the remote end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinal of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a score of Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-mortal games exhibit the best opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been targets already two minutes in the game when Mengas first passport released Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle fielder missed his great chance and shot outside.
A free park on the depth of Keaghan Jacobs then reached the lawyer Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back of the chair.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo must have felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson vivided the call of the Colombian.
Rangers only managed to make two goals in the first half of the game, but the former Ibrox painter Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibalys nick and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis opening shot in 34th minute may go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their servant deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's fixed situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fits Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the exchange gave almost immediate effect when the outer hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to make the opponents play exactly the kind of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swept up long passing after long passing.
Holt's side could have strengthened his leadership in the last stage, but McGregor was well able to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow nicked outside after the corner.
The Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late claim for punishment when he was tampted with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanack: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physician Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to the manick called Geiger meters.
Geiger meters have become a foundation for science since then and also figures great in popculture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the main role of the seemingly unlikely cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on you, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms produced by radioactivity in the minerals. "Evans:
Evans, "Yes, it pops now!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention wearing his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method means extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms and then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancer forms.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who learns the immune system to recognise cancer, saw her ovariescancercellers disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common for many cancer forms called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast-, egg-stock, lung and thick intestine cancer, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learn" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Canye West supported Trump by carrying a MAGA-cap, after its SNL appearance.
It didn't work so well.
Canye West was bowed out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swimming appearance in which he praised the US President Donald Trump and said that he would apply himself for the entry 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he had a Make America Great-Sheep, he rebelled against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood Star deceived Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate's Legal Committee on the accusations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it wasn't sent, the playback of West's layout was loaded on social media by the comic Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive with West with the post.
West had also regret the audience that he had been depressed backstage for his headbone.
"They mocked me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that crap on."
They mocked me!
And then they say I was low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Will you also sink lowly?" and said that he would "set my supermancape on, because that means you can't say what I can do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Test with love."
His comments attracted more burops at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, reported Variety. One person said, "It became the deadly in the studio."
West had come in as a later replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West surprised many with their appearance of the song I Love it, dressed for a perrier bottle.
West received support from the Chief of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who twisted: "To one of the most courageous souls: TACK TO TAKE YOU MUST MOBBBEN."
But the host of the chat show, Karen Hunter, twisted that West was simply "self and it's totally wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe is embraced and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We're too, she added.
Before the show, the raper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the being previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, even known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkollege, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
They for murder attempts for knife cutting at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of murder attempts after a man was knitted on a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The reply is expected to be found at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington strikes against toxic maskulinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, has said negatively about the stereo type of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be hard to respect.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic maskulinity during the #MeToo eran.
Kit, who recently married his spectator in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even her 31, acknowledged that he feels "very strong" to deal with the problem.
"I feel personally quite strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with maskulinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic maskulinity due to its very maskulin characters.
He went on, "What's inherited and what's inline?
What is learned on TV and on the streets, making young boys feel that they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it really is one of the major issues of our time - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also acknowledged that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actress recently revealed that he thinks that the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kits character Jon Snow loves, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family ownership in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% of the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820 000 people have been affected in the country, says healthcare authorities.
Approximately 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transmitted through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally HIV is rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through joint is an acute issue in China's HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination of HBT people is said to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men before or later will marry women.
Many of the infections are due to insufficient protection of joint ventures in these relations.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of the efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to leak the GOP-senator's tasks, shields on "dangerous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters condemned the claim that one of her employees had placed personal data on three Republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that these claims were spread by right-extremistic websites.
"Laughs, lies and more rejective lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information contained home addresses and telephone numbers to the senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of a Senate Panel on the charges of sexual violations against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of the Water staff, reported Hill.
"This unreasoned claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been endangered as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unreasoned claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement was quickly criticised online, including from the White House's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," said Fleischer.
"This indicates that she has no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They can't be proud.
They may not question the questioner's motives.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water’s response to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during the Thursday interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who candidated to dispose of Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Large of true," he twisted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and criminal action being of these fraudulent requirements.
"We will ensure that the actors will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parodie by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new film with British slope, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action komedin - a series of spy parodies kicked in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the water satir of how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has received its license to customer for the second time renewed - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for biopublic even in non-English-speaking countries
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims on smoothieglamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a gnutta Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from opening ceremony to OS in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that creates chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two nice moments in the latest JE film
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor leaves hit his helmet for a short while.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedium is shown, but the humor feels quite low and strangely overwhelming, especially because the "serious" film marks like 007 and Mission Impossible itself now offers comedium as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's adapted to children instead of adults and for me, Johnny English's strange notion is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stump film brafather in the role of Bean.
The ongoing issue is now that the United Kingdom is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super secret web network of spys, which reveals the identity of all the United Kingdom agents out in fields, to the agent in the service's great dissatisfaction - a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and hardly employed figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of its political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the manus does not offer much to work with.
Her notifying adviser informs her that when each active spy is busy, she must use someone who is retired.
And that means the descendant Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as teacher of a prosperous institution, but which offers inofficial lessons in art to work undercover next to.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with its previously long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine, a jolly-hockey-sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to disposed of.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terriblely wrong with Her Majesty's Secret Service and hit Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the carismatic technique millarder, who claims that he can solve the British computer fraction: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssé of farsighted adventures: dressed for servants, they put fire on a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on the Voltas luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he trys to use a VR headset to know the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of jobs behind the last sequence, but even though the film is both charming and speedful, it has an air of child TV around itself.
It's pretty moderate everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't stop thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies a plan for British to work a four-day week but get wages for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's party Labour considers a radical plan that is based on the British work for a four-day week - but is paid for five.
According to the party, business leaders would like to transfer savings made by the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra vacant day.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend, but keep the same wages.
According to sources, the idea would "pass" with the party's economic agenda in favour of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress trade organisation as a way for employees to benefit from economic changes.
A representative higher in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits the party's attitude to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Party The Greens who promised a four-day working week during his election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not listed by Labour as a whole.
A speaker for Labour said, "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and it's nothing that the party agrees on."
Shadow Cancer John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from "sightless leaders" and "sniller" on state companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of aquaculture companies cannot get back all their efforts, as a Labour government can make "deductions" because of what they perceive have been wrong acts.
He also confirmed plans to set employees in business boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds, where 10% of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, which then stands to receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell us in the TV program "60 minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question of whether the investigations of the Agency could cause some Republican senators to change the position on the matter.
In a Sunday interview, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would lead to a change in their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and said, "Have you done that?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems unreasonable.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamic idea," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it strongly," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all she named couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be hosted by the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormous impressive setting of stars that appear and a similarly impressive assignment; fighting world poverty.
Now during its seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people walking to Central Park's Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the event's real goal: fighting extreme poverty by 2030.
According to a 2012 statement, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international prosecutor group that hopes to be able to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work, mail a world leader, call or in other meaningful ways contribute to increasing awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen remained with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a twot?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "deeds" have been registered from its followers who have fought for a variety of different objectives.
It says that these measures have contributed to encouraging world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion, which will affect life for more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that the assets collected have hitherto had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom between investors and players who are involved in "helping children to develop to their full potential", promised to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to combating undernuance in the area after having received more than $4 700 twots from global citizens.
"With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, like you, we can make social injustice as undernutting is a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Partnership Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 measures were taken, which require the United Kingdom to improve the cost of mothers and children, the government announced financing of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programs aimed at 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on his website, "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Answered Global Citizen: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartness movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who appear at the New York Year Event, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicates the Minister of Home Affairs.
The government can "as necessary" access its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed the American Secretary of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it works on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a predecession to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, Europe's southern parts," he said.
And according to him there are ways and means to deal with it.
"United States have the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that seaways are kept open and, if necessary, apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group called "the energy consumer's voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and he noted that they really are the same.
"The economic option towards Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day run" with a economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
After the Trump administration has been aimed at increasing the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "catch of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington's resistance to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressures and for consumers to be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position was rejected by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federal of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly disappoint that a third party disturbs our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she is going to set up in the presidential election 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential elections after the US middle election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman at the top," she said, "The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'm gonna take a real thinker to climb to the presidential post."
Warren weighed into President Donald Trump during the Council meeting and said "he took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply worried about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been free-speaking in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a twoth on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own followers did not believe that she would apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "religious" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not candidate, according to an investigation carried out by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate hours.
The study showed more support for a candidate tour of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking a arrival in September.
He was arrested and accused of violence at home on Monday evening
"What my own son goes through, what he's going through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who experience PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back as other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of violence at home against a woman, attempting to prevent a report on domestic violence and arms holding in drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, and the Columbia District support the question of a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial trial aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who escape gang-related violence or violence at home.
Representatives from the 18 States and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum applicant who challenges the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the proceedings in Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner, "and his violent gang members," abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries who produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations faced with major problems of gangs and violence at home.
The new US asylum policy changed a decision by the immigration authorities from 2014 which made it possible for illegal immigrants to seek asylum to flee from violence at home.
The district of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances applicable to the requirement, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the friend-of-the court report.
Advocates further claimed in the report that the policy that denies the entry of immigrants harms the American economy and argues that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "lever the necessary labour force".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions in June ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled violence in home and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to ease all the problems - including all serious problems - people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death figure is doubled in the hunt for survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked ever harder.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feebling boy in a evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"Ambulance's picking up dead bodies all the time.
Pure water is a defective."
The inhabitants were seen return to their destroyed homes, rotted through water damaged possessions and tried to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were injured in the 7.5 earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, affected by a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because of continued strong afterscalves.
With tear - filled eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shake the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't flee.
I was pressed into the wall ruins, I think," told Haris to Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then it became silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided advertisement in an American newspaper on the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador accused China of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a grant in the Des Moines Register - State Iowas best selling newspaper - after accusing China to try to participate in the 6th Congress elections of the United States, something that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Peking tried to mix in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters where is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Peking and Washington are currently locked into an escalating trade war with high tariffs on each other's imports.
China's remuneration tariffs early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in countries such as Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador in China and the former long-term governor in Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a debate article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "that is doubled by putting propaganda ads into our own free press."
"China's government uses the dear American tradition of freedom of speech and a free press to spread the propaganda by publishing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newspaper ski on the street here in Peking, you will find a limited number of deviating votes and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's anxiety economy, because the media are controlled with iron hand by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers nobbed the offer to publish" his article, even though he didn't say what newspaper.
Republicans scare away female electors in the middle election through Kavanaugh fiaskot, warns analytics
Since many top Republicans defend the nominated Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court, which is faced with several accusations of sexual abuse, analytics have warned that there will be a relapse, especially from women, during the coming election.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they are in the election.
Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, says that it is not possible to turn the clock back to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he's doubting Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt to a FBI investigation will be enough to calm up angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrating "November comes!" scanned when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans who control the Court Committee chose to go on with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go on the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news site.
"The people say it was already high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indefinite female electors in the forests and younger electors, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, even though they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Already before Ford’s public testimony with accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analytics suggested that a rejection could follow if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused touch for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only whether the Committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh comes through, it is also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities United States, a group assisting democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans generally seem to be divided over who to believe in the cold water of Fords and Kavanaugh's witnesses, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new YouGov opinion survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying under his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as those from at least another charger, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate Court Committee during the ed last week that Kavanaugh attacked her violently at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed her sex bodies to her while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inruption, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inruption is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or an POD.
It may contain contact lists, to do-lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique with the personal online data storage is that it is totally up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data".
The idea of Inruption, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some program developers to work with the project and a group of volunteers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inruption website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on high edge over one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruption's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been a influenceful vote in the debate on network neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inruption, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and head of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic in front of this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Priest rewarded with Viktoria cross during the first world war celebrated
The only priest in the English Church that was rewarded with a Victoria cross during the first world war is now celebrated in its home city 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a doll shooter four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious price of the British military.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren under a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brillian symbolic" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the price.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his batalion on 29 September 1918 over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
Later he rushed up to the shot line and led with "great braveness" line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German prick shooter on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble in front of."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put down a crane after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he knew very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got to see Greta Gris instead
Imagine this, you've stopped all night to see Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 matches, including sex on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British watchers were surprised when the program was suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were little impressed after staying awake to the early morning hours to watch the match.
One fan on Twitter described the program change to a signed child program as "a sick joke."
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice CEO for marketing and communication when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes."
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they'll work with their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution to the reprise," said Coker.
"But there's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, the program exchange was upset by many.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our head in our striving to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "underlying" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says to feel underlying his companions during his growing up because of his sexuality, but it also encouraged him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that he wasn't like anybody else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hop".
He also said that he cared less about winning OS after becoming parent.
The popular show's ordinary program manager, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months free because of disease.
During his one-time appearance on Lavers' first program, Daley tells him how he felt "minder host" than others during his grown up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "This feeling of feeling less host and feeling me different has been a real source of the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "one," he said, so he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic Bronze Mediator has become a high-profiled advocate of HBT rights and used its appearance at the Commonwealth Games of the year in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he said that because he felt happily able to live open without limitations and wanted to give others "hop".
The three-fold world champion said that his in love with a man - the American film maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "come as a surprise."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as 14-year-old and his father died by cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone at the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they had his tickets to the Olympic Games in London 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first line.
"I couldn't say to him, you won't be able to sit on front line dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged that he was not unconquered," he said.
The following year Daley competed at OS 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to diving before a home public on an Olympic scene, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the OS and still gave him shaking.
Desert Island Discs are sent on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson from the shape of the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will hit record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the centre of events, which he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting heyaclack and practicing on his game in the hope of having a chance to show his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even on the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the tough banana at Le Golf National, where the long rubbish often fails hard.
It's not just the banana that shocks, in the ninth match on Sunday Mickelson meets the champion Francesco Molinari, who, along with the novel Tommy Fleetwood, won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, which are 4 points below front of the 12 single matches, have a wind in the beginning, Mickelson's match may be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a klapp on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's self-confidence is nothing wrong with it.
He is a famous man, and he has spent so much to these laws during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two matches.
I thought he'd be able to do more, but now it's what it is and we'll be happy with it.
He wants to be out there, like everybody else."
On Sunday Mickelson Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Cleaner Cup career that never completely lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halfs, but Furyk said his presence brought other quality teams.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, chicken, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He spends so much more than just games."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memorial only
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows of experience that a significant lead in the last ones of the day in Ryder Cup can quickly change to an uncomfortable experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under the leadership of the Seven Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally won with the least possible margin with the result 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Man reminds you that we led greatly at Valderrama, we led great at Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with need and neps," said Bjorn (on photo) after having seen the 2018 class win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and all of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow, we'll give everything.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the table.
Our goal is to try to win this pokal and that's where our focus is.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was satisfied with the performance of his players on a tough golf course and added: "I would never manage this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges are awaiting.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performance that applies and it is a completely different thing.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it's good, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golf player is tested full.
That's the message you need to communicate to the players, to get out the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he has to go and get out the best of himself."
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of great conversions during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended as losers when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word of it," he said as an answer when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to go out as fast as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the pace starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediaries.
We made our position and placed the guys we wanted to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the battle and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," said Bjorn about their single choices.
Germany's new warships will be postponed again
The latest fregate of the German fleet would have been sealed in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the cold war, but it will not be sealed until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The operation of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leadship for the entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg fregates, has now been suspended to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military speaker.
The vessel should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems arising after delivery were deadly for the ambitious project.
The four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen fregates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of air weather and sea target missiles, as well as some smuggling techniques, such as reduced radars, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest fregates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
Continuous delays, however, mean that the ban breaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are in operation, says Die Zeit.
The deadly F125 frequent created headings last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship in service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media indicated a number of important "smudge and hardware errors" which made the warship worthless if it was used on a battle mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older fregates in the Bremen class.
It also appeared that the ship has a significant overweight, which leads to impaired performance and limits the capacity of the marine to perform future upgrades.
The 7000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar vessels used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project's price note - including training of crew - will also become a problem.
It is said to have amounted to fraud 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - compared to 2.2 billion euros in the initial stage.
Problems affecting the most recent fregates are particularly important in the light of the recent warnings that Germany’s sea power reduces.
In the past of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet "is actually beginning to have a shortage of fully equipped ships".
The official said that this is a growing problem, since old vessels are discontinued but no replacement vessels were provided.
He complained that none of the fregates of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the marine.
National Trust Thefts for the Secret Life of the Fladdler Mice
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish highlands aims to reveal how flatter mice use the landscape in their hunting for food.
We hope that the results will throw a new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and contribute to the management of future preservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at National Trust for Scotland, will follow South and Dværgpistrell as well as brown borrowers and Daubenton fladdermöss at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special players will be placed in important places around the property to track flater mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of fladder mice sounds and the species that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Natural Health Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal the areas of life environment that are most important for the flatter mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of life-wide management work such as the creation of angels and how to best maintain forest fields for flatter mice and other related species.
Flattermus populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects bon and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also constitute a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and attacks from hut taxes.
Fladdermice isn't really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching the change.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flater mice seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, investigates bon and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated flater mice reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfreees and Galloway, home for eight of Scotland 10 flater mice species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threave we have a good area for flatter mice," he said.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of wheat trees and a variety of favourable habitats.
But there is much about fladdermice that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand more about what they need to enjoy.
He emphasizes the importance of looking for flatter mice before carrying out maintenance in real estates, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly eradicate a whole population.
Fladdermice is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their bone.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our flatter mice and for many of our species we don't know how their populations feel."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to vote the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him for "false news" and says that people "will market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will vote the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her 375,000 dollars to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) dismissed the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after reporting the requirements.
"No no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good," said the player and smiled.
Ronaldo lawyers are prepared to vote Der Spiegel on claims, which they have called "a unauthorized reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek reimbursement for "moral damage to a amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The claimed event is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted at the Clark County Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on the knee after the claimed event and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayal of the "sist percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was consentful.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a reconciliation because she felt "frightened from recompensation" and was worried about "become humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the conciliation because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will be forever repentant" to lose car manufacturers
United Kingdom "will regret it forever" if you lost your status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "angry" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they will temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event that no contract was concluded could result in loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyotas CEO of Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini installation in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problem concerns what car manufacturers say is the risk of the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is operated on the "just-in-time" basis, with parts that come every 37th minute from both the United Kingdom and the EU suppliers for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may lead to disturbances at the border that the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of consumption in stocks at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and therefore production would be forced to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a settlement. We want the best agreement that allows, as I say, not only success to be appreciated at present, but for us to take this opportunity," he said to the BBC Radio 4: program Today.
"The statements from not just Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is leader of the Unite Facks Association at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
One government official said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again," says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Vice-President of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "shot in another week" while the fight against the High Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors work with the special adviser Robert Mueller, who examines Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the Vice-President of Justice, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has given fuel to Washington's clowns for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility to carry out cancellation equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility to dispose of the President via the 25th supplement of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he would go out came.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, which will be held on Thursday.
Trump said that he would " prefer" not to kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee's interrogations where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual inequity, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of accusations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "A date for it has not been established, it may happen this week, or a postponement with a week in view of all the other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters would argue that statement: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The values Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disappointment against TV reporters like "playing for the gallery," even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds more questions than any president before him," she said and added without quoting evidence, "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot over the past few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances to the gathered reporters.
Minister for Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland with regard to concerns about Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of settled status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit have continued, before decisions that are expected to come in autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very alarming time for you all.
Therefore, I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing acute surgery after he has suffered from head damage
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie undergone an acute surgery after having suffered a major damage in Saturday's loss with 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennesseans Mike Organ.
Tennessee States Head Trainer Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the sidebar and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before he was placed on a bar was carried out for further evaluation.
A representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center hospital.
Harris added that "there is no data on the type/volume of damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which gave him a seasonal total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when buying property in Britain, and the extra money is used to help homeless, according to the Tory Party's new plans
The action will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the tax on stamp will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The British Ministry of Finance expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers shall pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's successes in attracting young voters with promises of housing at more affordable prices and aiming at high income recipients.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taken from individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a push to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is added beyond the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in recreational housing and housing purchased for rent. It may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will take up to 120 million pounds per year.
Approximately 13% of the newly built property in London is purchased by people who live outside the UK. This drives prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many well-established areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new play will be just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first residence.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and called on Theresa May to refrain from allowances on housing at affordable prices to solve the "drawn housing situation" of Britain.
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a magnificent enough proposals for housing reforms, including rental roofs and an end to waxes without the tenant's disguise.
He also wants to give the municipalities more opportunity to build new housing.
Theresa May says: " Last year I said that I would spend my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and build up a life here.
However, it cannot be right when it is equally easy for people not living in Britain, and even for companies based abroad, to buy housing as too hard-working inhabitants of our country.
The dream of ownership of their dwelling has become just a distant dream for too many people, and homelessness is still an invaluable fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is ever to become Scotland trainer.
The 42-year-old shots look forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeast England, which is currently on third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light last summer after letting St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B-Land team and that's all," says Ross to BBC Scotlands Sportsound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my father, and it's always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I succeed in leading a club."
Among Ross' representatives as trainer for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about pursuing such established names in such a big club. He has previously refused the offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now I consider success based on the answer to the question, can I get this club back to the Premier League?"
This club belongs absolutely to the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a trainer for three years, after a period of assisting trainer in Dumbarton and a 15-month sejour as a member of Heart's training team.
Then he helped Alloa come back from down to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close downwards to winners of the mastership title then season thereafter.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his player career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a reason for the road," he recalls and points to when he took the command over Alloa.
"I really thought that leadership was quite right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds weird, because I had all right results and I could live greatly on it. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be hard.
It's a lot you have to go through every week.
It's still stress and pressure on the job for me, but training feels quite right.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it. I'm feeling better than I've ever done throughout my adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer’s heat ball has resulted in increased revenues for the country’s fighting pubars, but the restaurant chains have become more pressed.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from the CGA Corporate Advisory Society, who has compiled the figures, said: "Continue beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the VM longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the puba went up by 2.8%. However, the restorations had even greater difficulties.
The reduction in the sales of restaurants by 1.8% in June only became worse in July.
Pubars and bars offering mainly drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had risen more than the restaurants had declined.
Pubars offering food were also difficult in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to have just wanted to go out and drink something.
The impact of managed pubs and bars increased the sale of drinks by 6.6% that month, and the sale of food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman at the servering and entertainment industry RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports events are still the most important factors in sales on the large kitchen market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% per year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to the current cost pressure.
The long warm summer couldn't have come more unfamiliar for companies driven by food sales. Time can show if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August gives a well-needed respit."
The total sales increase in the pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that new brands are now launched.
The industry seller Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub-bar and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyzes data on how 47 active groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, and is a established benchmark in the industry.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
One study shows that one of five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers
A study of 20 000 students at high school shows an increase in the number of false Instagram pages
The result has increased the concern that it is sexual content that is posted there
20% of the students said they had a "head account" which they showed to their parents
One of five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A study of 20 000 students at high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram Image Sharing Service.
The result has fainted anxiety that it is sexual content that is posted there.
20% of the students said they have a cleaned "head account" that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.

According to the study, conducted by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of the children between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The Chairman of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says, "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to create sites on the Internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the idrotts" in the Board of Scottish Athletics, the Scottish Free Sports Association
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the annual meeting of the Governing Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most praised free sports rats, and the President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those leading sports to benefit from her wide experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I want to be a voice for the sports and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at OS in Atlantic 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentary at BBC. He lost the ability to walk after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter, "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time was given to show if I would recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows sharing the Internet
A company selling breast pumps has caused disagreements on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
In order to note the launch of what is said to be the world's first silent portable breast pump, the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video inspired advertising film with humoristic appreciation to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump giving mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a high-filled lady with cows to a song with text lines like, "Yes, I milk myself, but have no tail" and "If you didn't know it, this isn't a jewel, but tits."
The refruit continues, "Damp out, pump out, I eat the babys, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused conflict on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it throws light on the "phases" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Like we, they must be pregnant and feeding in order to produce milk, but their kids are taken from them only a few days after birth," says one person.

Another comments: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But sure, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another person adds: "Welch reality-based advertising film."
Others defend the movie, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically fun."
"I think this is brilliant.
I'd have got one if I still stomached.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertising film is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a genial product," writes someone.
Another comments: "This is a funny advertising film that turns to moms who pump (often on the workplace or on the toilet) and feels like 'cousses'."
This is not a film that shouts or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, women reveal that they all danced with the discreet pump stopped in the cage.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women pumping milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be weared discretely in a breast-feeding hook, which gives women freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a participant and ECD at Mother, and she says, "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a courageous and provocative launch.
By dragging a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while in an entertainable and easily recognisable way showing the incredible feeling of freedom of the new pump.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump creates headings.
During the London fashion week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk with clothes by the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved in silence to a tent camp near the border of Texas
The number of freely-owned migrant children has shot high, even though the number of people crossing the border every month is relatively unchanged. This is partly due to the fact that hazy retorics and hard policies introduced by the Trump Government have made it more difficult to place the children in reference persons.
In the past, most reference people themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fear to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the immigration and customs authority, witnessed to the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of persons who had requested to be references to single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by criminal enforcement authorities since earlier.
"Nearly 80% of the persons who are either referenda or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Albence.
In order to address the matters of children faster, officials have introduced new rules which require that some of them be found in the court within one month of their depriving their freedom, rather than after 60 days of practice, according to the staff of the negotiations.
Many of them are present on video link rather than personally to bring their appeal for legal status before a immigration judge.
Those who are not considered to have the right to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of freedom, the more likely it is that they are suffering from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or refugee attempts, according to the staff of the lectures and reports from the system in recent months.
Prosecutors say that concern rises at larger installations such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has it more likely to be ignored because of its size.
They add that if children are moved to the city of the tent without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and to say goodbye to friends, the trauma of many already struggled can worse.
Syria requires American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-Premier Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian land, under the prosecution of combating terrorism, and "will be managed accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Damaskus government would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-locked country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that these circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of "spread irrational fear" that enables refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They police something that should be a pure humanitarian question."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel mount Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political conversations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement managed a great attack on Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "precise deadlines", and expressed the hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusra front, which will be "extinguished".
The United Nations missionary Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to gather the first meetings of a new committee composed of government members and opposition members in order to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to run the path for elections.
Moualem set up conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the group's work would be limited to "the review of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-elective 2020 unless his presidentship was terminated in the past through the right of Kingdom law and scandal, which many liberal viewers probably hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidentship ever!"
Now there are no signs that the watchers have tired.
Since 2014, the best shipping time watch figures have been doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times so high, 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on the best broadcasting time, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during large news evenings.
"This is like a fire to which people are attracted, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scovell has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before election 2016.
The driver told me he'd vote on Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' Nell Scovell tells me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, in contrast to everything else on TV, the Washington report can determine the future of the case of abortion, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the welfare of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged watchers can afford.
Yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you suddenly have seated and looked for six hours at an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bombing jacket of struts for $15,000 ("a cloth filled with hybris", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabra descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomi.
I'll never look at Super Mario myself in the same way again.
"A part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump follow-up's rotating role crew and daily intrigues (concern with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single section, you'll end up on the afternoon.
When I talked to the TV producer Mr Fleiss this week, there was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in the north of Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and uggled inside and watched MSNBC while recording a consignment from CNN.
He couldn't beat himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be put in front of the Senate's Jurisdiction Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the wave.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the evenest race ever before the mid-year election
It is not surprising that the 17th Congress District of Pennsylvania receives a lot of money. It is thanks to the restructuring of a congress district that has made two members contest about the same place.
This recently resigned suburb district in Pittsburg is represented by the Democrats Conor Lamb, who took place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, the Republic of Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were resigned after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign financing dispute between the most important parts' economic sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a button gain in a widely monitored special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain propulsion.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador for China support but backed then
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Peking, with some opposition from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the delegates dismissed the Trump Organisation's leadership team.
Officials of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "new decision to no longer acknowledge Taiwan," said the minister's speaker Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
But only penalties were planned against El Salvador, which received estimated $ 140 million in U.S. assistance 2017, including drugs control and development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have struck the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings continued, US and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
In the middle of September, however, high officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice stopped considering sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in the mid-October.
And the three American messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A speaker for John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, described by the three American officials, two of whom agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outstanding analytic who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next unavoidable step may become the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on the alleged violation of Donald Trump in judicial matters, for which there is now considerable evidence in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to direct its investigation against whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If the Congress would change the majority, Trump will be held responsible in front of that congregation just when he prepares himself for once again to take up the elections, and maybe finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to claim that Trump will inevitably fall, so not his colleagues in Europe either.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how extended the battle can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to put an ice crew against Hitler, if only the Western countries had stood against him and stood behind the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of blood bathing that followed.
History surrounds such decisive events, and the unwaversible promarsch of democracy is either hurrying on or braking.
The Americans now face several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Vice-President Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what will happen to Mueller's investigation, kicked?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he should have proposed to record the President in secret and wondered that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times report is not correct.
"How should we answer whether the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he may enter the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle elections at a congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we'll fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jews and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrant to the United States and 60 years later, she sent me away to turn the Sabbath light on the table decorated with the hackors.
With it as heritage, how could I be other than optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic in front of the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers receives Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that the victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spanish game against Villarreal that ended uncertainly before the month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in Europe League.
A knee-injured prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to the 2-2-match against Villarreal. But he thinks that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for greater successes.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good law," says the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and went away with a point.
Perhaps we could have got it in the end, but in the whole, there was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half of the game, and we came back in the second half game and were the better team.
On Thursday, there will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can certainly move forward and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troop is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep bad because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the investigation had a clear picture of how they wanted to be treated, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the countrywide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about that.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
This is how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may be of great importance for the costs.
Help your economic adviser: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover costs, or a self-surance with your own resources, if you have advice.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Create a medical authority, so that you can designate a trusted person who looks at your medical care and ensures that care professionals follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a power for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapable.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine you have an elderly parent who gets into an acute medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Would you, then, be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake, but who's the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are it?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready."

Earthquakes and tsunamia in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia in Friday. It states officials. The death figure is expected to rise.
Communications are excluded, and rescue staff have not yet been able to get any information from the Donggla management area, a region north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake epicenter. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the main place in the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The population of the city was estimated to 379 800 persons in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40-year anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami attacked.
Dongga is a management area extending more than 300 km from the northwest coast of Sulawesi.
The management area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated to be 299 200 persons in 2017.
The support pillars in the province of Central Sulawesi are fisheries and agriculture, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel growing is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggla have been affected by tsunamia several times over the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Also, in 1996, a tsunami killing nine people suffered the western Donggala.
Indonesia is located in the circumpacific seismic fire ring, often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamies in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake at the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on the northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami affected 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with the magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale hit south of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, and triggered a tsunami that attacked the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A earthquake with magnitude 7.6 hit near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A earthquake with magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to 10 meters was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A basic earthquake affected the management area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that raped together.
2018: Great earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palins oldest son arrested for violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested suspicious of violence in the home, for having taken into account a notification of violence in the home and for being opposed to arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska's State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a woman's familiar who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin sits free in the Mat-Su arrest and is held against the 500 dollar deposit to be paid if the suspect violates the debt conditions, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday and declared himself "not guaranted guarantor" when he was asked to declare his attitude, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious crimes under class A, which means that he can get prison for up to a year and $250,000 in fine.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious crime under class B, which is punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
It's not the first time Palin's accused of crime.
In December 2017 he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by Alaska's veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of violence at home, of having put himself in the notification of violence at home and of holding weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after having linked her son's violent behavior to posttraumatic stress syndrome, which comes from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after a earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are downwards, and the death figures are expected to rise in the next days.
The earthquake hit just outside the central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Films showing when it hits are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunamin hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors impose rare death penalty for a suspect of terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutor in New York claims death punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terror attack in New York who killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, should have used a car rental from the construction and furnishing chain Home Depot to perform an attack on a bike road along the West Side Highway at the bottom of Manhattan. He emitted footgangers and bicycles in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious body damage, according to the intention of death penalty sent in the Southern District of New York.
Both points of accusation may mean a death sentence, according to the judicial act.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused by a 22-point federal jury, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in targets of organised crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "wide planning and intent," said the chargers, while described the way Saipov carried it out as "awful, cruel and unhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss", says the intentional explanation.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's Southern District has not accused in a target of death penalty in a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for murder of two offenders, but was finally sentenced to lifetime prison in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal trial in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced for stamping to spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed both in the electric chair on June 1953.
Saipov, an Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he declared to the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the case, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked to put the IS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He has not declared guilty of the 22 points of charge.
David Patton is one of the federal public defences representing Saipov. He said they're "absolutely disappointed" on the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to pursue death penalty instead of admitting to lifetime prison without the possibility of conditional release if the accused acknowledges guilty only extends trauma that these events have caused for all involved people," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for death penalty.
Mr Tories' Member says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the army of the people" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said that the politicians had to "recognize the hotness" of the EU sceptics when one of Theresa May's own Members suggested that he would lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative member Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom should have already "passed out" if Nigel Farage had been Minister of Brexit.
However, the challenge that Theresa May faces when it comes to bringing the deep-parted adherents to reconciliation has been worse by EU-positive tory members who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive under the attacks of Brexitan trailers, those who want to stay in the Union and the European Union itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press on and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the relapse, and force EU shippers and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the organisation Leave Means Leave in Solihole that he wanted to "spole the Chequers agreement".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the rod, we would have been out at this time," he said.
Peter Bone, representing the Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must spolate the Chequers Agreement."
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought World War to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the claims that the general opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to remain is completely false."
The Brexitan trailer Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party also joined the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Premier Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers Agreement is impopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is impopular in the party and in our electoral workers who are out on the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Put off the Chequers agreement and start listening."
And she added a sharp message addressed to Theresa May, "Premier Ministers will keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that the politicians must "recognize the heat" if they fail the decision taken during the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say to them, "We won't let you get away with it."
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilise the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, EU followers marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists vibrated with courses with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched in the weekend.
The Labour parliamentarist Lord Adonis from the Overhuse spotted the conservatives of security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"They are these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all technology for Canada plus plus plus agreement, for freectionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure father's.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans a "ordinary thinker" about applying to the president's post
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "ordinary thinker to quit the presidential post" after the elections in November.
The newspaper Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke of their future during a city house meeting in the West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and now re-electing the republikan state representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice-president of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She's been subject to speculation that she might take on Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city house meeting with the voters since Donald Trump joined.
Someone asked her if she planned to approve of the presidential post.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government. This means a woman at the top.
A person arrested for the death shooting of the basketball player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death shooting of the LSU basket player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The police at Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for the ET.
They had released a movie of the shooting on Friday to get help to identify a man seen on the pictures.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot damaged in his head and eventually died of this," said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had been on the site and had a weapon, and he acknowledged that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and was arrested at the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches with 10 starts last season, and cut in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returnes per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world champion's title after the team order gave him profit over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it was clear that Mercedes' team order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start and almost hanged out Hamilton on the dry when he defended his position during the first two yards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went then first, and let Hamilton run in the back of the club, which should have been crucial.
Mercedesen went in on a ship later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver deliberately left the inside free with the risk of offering place after a double train to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seven at the end of the first yard on his 21th anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race and kept in the decks to reach a fast target and run around Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he came into the depot of the 44th yard but failed to increase the pace during the remaining eight yards when the Raikkonen went up on the fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who left me.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and two," said Hamilton.
Correctly bad body language
President Donald Trump insulted senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday because she maintained that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual violation.
The President, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address the witness of Ford before the Senate's Jurisprudence Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "elake, disguise and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the fine thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, bad, disgraced and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leakages, and they say, "No, I haven't done it.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Wait a minute.
"Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, imitating the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't darkened Ford's accusations, I have not leaked her story," said Feinstein to the Committee according to the newspaper The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidentially as she wanted."
But her dementia does not seem to have matched the President, who commented this on Saturday evening, "I'll tell you something. That was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual offences by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take the power back with all the necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to gain power and control," said the President according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars soned Friday's loss in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-target line through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie dismissed the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard kvitted Dundee before two cases from Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's law, who came back and hit Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting for the two laws, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 at the assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave help when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
During the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie, who kvitted at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again kvitted with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the profit with the fifth halfway of his team through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of his five last matches, will play at home against Milton Keynes at its next match on Friday.
Flight leaders died so that hundreds of people on a plane could escape from earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is now celebrated as a hero after he died when he saw that a plane of hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many lack after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong afterscalves continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the bread of the city of Palu.
However, although his colleagues fled for their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild sweating control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the startway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would break.
He died later in a hospital.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from the Balikpapa in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter came to Palu.
We are crushed to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death figure can rise to more than a thousand people. The country’s disaster aid authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggla, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death figure is supposed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies remaining in the ruins, and many have not been able to reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a speaker of the Authority.
Up to six feet high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute comes a ambulance with dead bodies.
There's no clean water.
Mini markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross struggles to help survivors, but we don't know what they will meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse."
The President of Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
In Indonesia, earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died, occurred earlier this year.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man is missing after a plane crashed in a lagune
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now states that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and crews had been eliminated from the falling plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crews after the plane crashed in the water when it tried to land at the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
On Friday, officials stated that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were left in the hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable.
It's still unclear what caused the crash and how the event progress looked.
The airline and the American fleet both said that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing path.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane was swallowing by the landing path.
The U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane fled very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through middie deep water to the emergency exits on the falling planet.
He said that the cabin crew was paniced and shouted, and that he had a smaller shell damage.
The U.S. fleet said that seafarers working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using a blowing boat to drive people into land before the plane dropped in the 30 meters deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 persons have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea for the past two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analytics draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor ended his complaint in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The American Ministry of Justice analytics Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as expert witnesses in the field of notification analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to push together the 29-year-old appealed to Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements that night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the evening she died, which contradicts his previous claims, reported the newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers’ mobile phone for the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis said the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis a time after Chambers' death, Chambers' text messages, conversations and contact information were deleted from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence is planned to start its final performance on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to be sent to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that the hiphop has come far away from its origin in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make aware hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently been swinged up in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black again?!
A baby girl in New York matches a couple because of a breakdown after a "racist" text message
A child girl in New York matches a couple for discriminatory cancellation after she received a wrong text message from her mother, who complained that she was "a black again."
The pair denies that they would be racists and compare the atmosphere with "expression".
Two grandmother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed fear when she realized that the new child girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEY NEW A SWORT AGEN," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "like to courage", and gave Maurice the fire, and claimed that their former child girl, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Philippine woman, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she is voting the couple for compensation for the dismissal. She demands compensation in the order of 350 dollars per day for the job she was first employed to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the accusations that they would be racists and said that the only right thing was to finish Giselle Maurice's job, and they were worried that they couldn't trust her when they had insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone with whom you had been in vain, even if it was mistaken?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood with "depressing" and said that his wife would feed children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Should you go on such a person?
It's not very nice done," added the Investment Banker Plasco.
The legal process is still in progress, but the general opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticizes them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn't think the readers could relate to a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
The author of Paddington Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, commented on the letter as follows: "It's hard to think about how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny, in view of what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterlous" after his death last year.
She describes that Paddington was a "much important member of our family," and added that her father was proud in silence over her final success.
"He was quite silent by himself, and not any ridiculous person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that succeeds with something. You get proud of the child even though it's not you who's done it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little bit like that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honor himself."
My daughter would die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been driven into Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that it wasn't expected that she would succeed," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my dear.
I'll be back to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was shut down.
I just got to sit there waiting and know all this happened.
I could not threw or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now grieved the loss of his daughter, went on board on board with the other passengers, who were completely unconscious of the difficult trial she passed through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head down, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women put up postal cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their affairs because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that can be called for support.
Sharon Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and he took his life when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells her son was a promised cock that had an infective smile.
"All knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lighted up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his sister when he had killed him in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm always worried about consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "to make people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been a friend of Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner since 15 years, Mark, a time after his mother's death.
"He hadn't said he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas, he was on the bottom, and when the kids opened his Christmas clapps, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard beat for them, but they have to go through it. "It breaks up a wound in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we all have to fight on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we could accomplish something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we might have a little consensus," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, and he added that he feared that the Committee would be "splitted" because of deeply rotted parties' distinctions.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their opposition depends entirely on the time.
The Middle Year elections will take place in only five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the one they want to have chosen to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary of George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where it is now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the death situation and confirm his decision to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean jumps "sjunks" under Kim
The number of North Koreans who jump to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, says that 1 127 people jumped out last year, compared to 2 706 in 2011.
Park says that harder border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher charges to traffickers are important reasons.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
The majority of Hops from North Korea were finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans must have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which has the highest border to North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the hardly monitored demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the hopes as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between North and South, which is still technically in war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Previously in the month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for discussions with focus on the fixed-run negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general to work for the Korean peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American penalties for the lack of success since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances we cannot defend ourselves unilaterally first," Ri said at a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi comments came in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help I thought that if a woman had beaten so, she would be called 'hysterical'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Jurisdiction Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the accusations of victiming Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally touched, and sometimes he screamed almost and the voice stuck when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, and said that the accusations against him were a "great and coordinated nature murder" organized by liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she thought that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, since it showed that he is partial to the disadvantage of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi doubted when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh in front of the Kingdom law if he was elected, and if the Democrats were given the majority of the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he does not tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he's on now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Appeal Court of Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that she, as a democrat, was concerned about what decision Kavanaugh might take against the health insurance law Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation requests, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would amend certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
It is not a position for a hysterical and partial person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said she also cried when she became angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began crying, she said to the person she spoke to, 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger partly because they are often misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once cried of unscriptive anger, was that I was taken in the throat of an older woman. It was a cold boss I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a staircase.
"Let them never see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and they'll be happy that they have been able to press you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was captured with a non-married business on a boat named Monkey Business and pulled out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to examine the idea of setting up in the presidential election itself.
"It wasn't a well-thinked decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snowit and the seven dwarfs."
Since she was late out, she was lying after the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get 2 million dollars together.
It was a project sentenced to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not initiate a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism, that the vote stuck.
"You could have thought I had a nervous crash," said Schröder apro of the press's reactions.
"You could have thought that Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna write on my grave stone?"
"She's crying?"
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Peking
The opening path in the trade war between the United States and China was eagle devastating. The war is far from over, but the crack between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
The U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by deploying important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with duties.
The most important trip came in the week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods coming into the United States from China are customs charged.
Beijing has answered each time with the same coin. Recently, fees of between five and ten percent were thrown on US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US measures. The world's next largest economy is probably not going to fall within overlookable time.
To get Washington back is to bow down for demands, but public crying for the United States would be too gentle to China's President Xi Jinping.
Experts, however, believe that if Beijing plays its card right, the press of the US trade war can provide a positive support for China in the long term, by reducing the mutual dependency of the two economies.
"A fast political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in each country, and it is in fact far more dangerous than the viewers previously wanted to acknowledge," says Abigail Grace, research assistant with focus on Asia at the Median Center for New American Security.
Syria "redo" for home refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to receive voluntarily returning refugees and calls for help to build up the country, which is ruined after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improved.
"The situation in place today is more stable and safe, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and dwellings.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syria have moved the country since the war began in 2011.
Additional six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian support.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that it did not receive any conditional support or assistance from countries who have supported the rebellion.
Europe ended with the victory in Ryder Cup, Paris
Team Europe has won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating Team USA with the final position 16.5 against 10,5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14,5 points required to hit the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, entered the water at the impact of the 16th hole pair of 3-way, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari glanced in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was struck out 5 & 4 of the lowest ranked players of the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest rated player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be helpful," said one moved Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He left the stavet pin to his countryman John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I'm grown up looking at him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder cup.
A strange statistics for one of the best players in the world ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been overcome by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled the whole weekend with finding fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the depressive performance of the team, "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fantasy.
The hatred for Thomas.
He's a fantastic captain.
All his 12 players were really good.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the US PGA tour and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud of being Captain.
You can bow and bow.
They played better than we did."
