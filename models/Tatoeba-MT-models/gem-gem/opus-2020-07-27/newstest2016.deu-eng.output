Obama received Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendship.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures of Teheran in the Middle East.
However, the meeting is also intended to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-country solutions discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been excited for years.
Washington criticizes the continued settlement building of Israel and rejects Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
The deal of Obama around the Iranian nuclear programme has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu, on the invitation of the Republicans, held a controversial speech before the US Congress, which was partly considered to be the affront against Obama.
The speech was not spoken with Obama, a meeting had rejected him with a reference to the contemporary election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to have shot his friend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told with a somewhat cruel voice from the police that he had shot his friend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note crushed on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities' information in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no hint that Lamb, who had been teaching in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school site, where he, according to the police, shot and killed a popular historian professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made the disasterous emergency call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when the police boiled him.
One day after the shooting at the university, the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to create a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he has no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching body includes 17 members, and many students visited courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendency to deal with problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a permit for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which the lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic way to work as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "naturally there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
These are questions that the Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lamb's track when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent house at the border of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she thought he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3.500 students in a city with about 12.000 inhabitants and taught geography and education.
He promoted in the spring in pedagogy.
One of the long-year friends of Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met through common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar game a few years.
He was the woman's swarm at that time.
All girls melted there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and lived in the Jackson forest of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were evidently a few times together.
In the emergency call Lamb said "I killed my wife", but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the backstone house that borders to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends were left and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail arrived on a summer-year market three years ago.
Later they played the one or other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter's writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb ended his guitar and mouth harmonic game before a splendid audience.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
"Simply just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joking.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American inhabitants and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, some 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the municipality, attended a Christmas Light Memorial.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwache while the university sing "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The lesson will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call described as his wife, but there is no hint that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to set up less employees for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas seasonal employees as last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to set up 40 000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country. In Christmas 2014, 45.000 workers were still discontinued.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will begin with an application conversation and the employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is closer, and companies are preparing to set up time workers to provide shops with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it will make me realize gradually that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a future documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to me that I am a simulated gan and a arm's length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "unfairly the largest time travel film ever turned."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and selected cinema in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon says that his answer to Russia's strengthened military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only eliminate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chair again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite themselves and support integral negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five Permanent Member Nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - at the edge of the General Assembly Ministerial Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regreted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this "unresolvable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in the crisis in Syria, which they have demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values showing that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to fire him as a flop.
Others gave him a joke.
And some are waiting for a crash.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper ranks on surveys down, it has (now) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump lead in two-digit fields, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the possibilities of nomination of the real estate moguls.
Of course it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at this time, Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, of which no one won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general choice.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize tromps' sustainability and start letting their dollars flow to crash him.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate-Mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trumps popularity values have turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidateship in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate-Mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa observed last week that 60 percent of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP winners would be happy with trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they would be either "enthusiastic" or "enthusiastic" if trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in things of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfactory" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is profoundly criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of the Irish electorates who tend to the Republicans believe that the real estate-Mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-selection state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a supervisor, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent thinks that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, so ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When they set up their scholarship guards, republikan electorates believe Trump to be real.
If they are asked who earns the GOP nomination, after a survey by CNN/ORC last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four of ten of the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full release: GOP winners had not the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it appears that a variety of GOP choosers view Trumps campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still hits almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while the anti-trup support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffus.
But a survey of the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, trump reaps the majority of support.
He has 13 points forward before Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who hit him?
Ben Carson would pick up the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A little majority of Donald-Trump fans say they have developed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have forgiven their voices firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change this, and no one can really say never change the opinion.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment of the other outside, the neurochirurg Ben Carson, but choosers who say they've educated their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called "Values" in his electoral peace two months ago, the immigration was a turning and fishing point in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are worried that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep decisive Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the ramp light, it will seem to do Donald Trump too.
The frustration of the government climbs to new ceilings.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their external status.
Six of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday Survey of ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa republics are frustrated over the Republicans at the Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "highly angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residents of Germany
The most expensive housing is located here on the Hobooken route - with a view over the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square metre of a Reetdachhaus costs in average EUR 73.300.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs most.
Of course, EUR 18.70 per square meter for a student bid in Munich is not really few.
Unlike Germany's top places, one of the prizes occur as peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential places - with square metres prices in distortioning heights.
There are several tens of thousand euros nix - per square meter, well-noted.
But good, who can afford it...
Otherwise, Munich is not at the top of this exceptional place.
Champions League: Bayern Dream Start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-fold Torskytt in Piräus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller ebned the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then it ran.
A solemn entrance of the Champions League season.
The world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have declared a dream start to the FC Bayern in the Piräus Hexenkessel into the "Mission Milan".
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their play in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52.90.+2) and Götzes hits (89.) earn at 3:0 (0:0).
The twelve start-up sequence in series is to be the first step towards Finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third time.
At his 28th meeting in the Champions League, Müller received good assistance from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who had a shot of the World Champions League that was planned.
"We won't underestimate them," had Bayern captain Philipp Lamm promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadion before 31,688 hot-blooding fans - and the coins held word.
They showed a focused and engaged idea without glance.
Piräus had won his last six home games in the king's class, including against naming clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) was also proud.
But the Bayers, in seven Europe Cup duals with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went courageously, but often in their offensive efforts to work.
The attacks were too often initiated by game shifting to the left outside Douglas Costa, which rarely passed through against the former Braunschweigering Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half field in the upper left torque.
In the 67th minute the world champion forgave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos storm Ideye Brown hit the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct departure, the Torwart Roberto coupled with the knee (35.).
Although the Bayers used to raise her dominant game, Piräus was able to put needle sticks.
On Torhüter Manuel Neuer, however, was left.
For example, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56.).
Before the newer, Guardiola had a four chain with David Alaba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng, which was good.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the frame, first sat outside.
The WM hels gave green light only after the graduation training, said Sports Manager Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to do something else of it, that is already evil."
Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by eleven meters, Müller put another one on it.
Before the game it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a small group of partially mumbled Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the trailers of host Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went with battleheads against the coins of trailers.
At least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
He who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
He who smokes does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this is a long-term potsdam study.
The good news: If you don't, the risk is rapidly lowered.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of premature loss of their teeth was to increase the 2.5- to 3,6-fold.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes of dental failure are caries and inflammation of dental meat, emphasizes the DIfE.
For this parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
Therefore, the relationship between smoking and dental loss decreases to more frequent dental meat inflammations in smokers.
It is not clear how much smoking also increases the risk of cares.
People who stopped smoking could, however, reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
It could, however, take over ten years until the danger again sink to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the British University of Birmingham.
You have to convince people to become non-smokers, he said, "Smoking reduces lifetime."
No smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health until our age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of teethlessness reported the DIfE.
Earlier investigations had already pointed out that smoking increased the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists run on Kölner Rheinufer on remains from the late ancient
For the repeated time, archaeological findings have been made at the right Rheinufer in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the building site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman German museum excavated shellet and remains of historical buildings, said the museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians are looking for so-called ground monuments.
For all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always attached as a specialist office for archaeological ground monument care.
In the third section of the Rhineboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
Text documents had already known that in the place of the 4th century a fortress and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
Besides the rest of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young Woman of Travel
After a young woman has been unhappy at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the population for assistance.
In the early Wednesday morning, at 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the gleaze from the direction of the railway building at the end of the railroad and was covered by a freight train that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
It has suffered the most serious injuries of the train, according to the Federal Police Office.
She was treated in the premise and brought by rescue forces to a hospital.
The reason for the nightly crossing of the young woman is not known to the detective officials.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
The question comes from residents or passengers from Linderner Railway, Tile Becker Road, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Road (L364).
An indications of the cause of the accident may be given by phone 0800/6888000 or any other police service at the clock and free hotline.
The EU Commission proposes a dispute on the TTIP new court
In order to resolve the dispute on the transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private settlement facilities for disputes between groups and states are therefore to be solved by a more transparent system which in its functioning is much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that the citizens trust," explained Commissioner Cecilia Malmström in the idea.
The Swedish authorities are in favour of bringing the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the United States.
The German Government announced support.
The TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitrary proceedings provide specifically that the EU Member States and the United States are selecting jointly independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They are intended to come from the same parts of the EU, the United States and third countries.
For the first time, it is also a second instance.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
Until now, the procedural parties agreed on arbitrators, there was no objection to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past months, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it wants to work on an International Investment Court according to its own information.
For example, there could be settled disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries.
The investor State skiing procedures (ISDS) required by large groups are one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe to TTIP.
The traditional disagreement courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can put off damage to taxpayers, lift national laws or apply a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact indicated the Commission's proposals as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that they were not to apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans for great progress.
The Commission took account of key points in the reform which the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arrival courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European BusinessEurope Association warned that the complaints of the economy should be restricted by too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged.
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be completed, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should already be set at the end of this year.
This date shall be regarded as unavoidable.
Delicate People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage in the Kölner Prime Club (now: Luxor).
Besides him, there is a flipchart on which the shocking people singer recorded the picturesque U.S. State Michigan with filtstift.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells us on the basis of various places that he repeatedly signs on the map, which his minusious and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they came from and what it looks like there, in his home.
Stevens has been a wonderful creative mistake since then.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" it appears smartly composed songs that are very close to the American people of the late sixties, but at any time can run into great opulent.
It is the rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of a modest series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be swinged as a result.
But already in 2004 and in Rheinnähe, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positive certain expectations.
Decreased Stevens occurs here.
Live satisfies him guitar and Banjo.
One year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), in 2005, there appears an outstanding celebrated masterpiece.
Throughout ideas and stylistic finess.
The album rises into the American Billboard Charts and is missing in no year's best list of influential music media.
After excessively productive experiments, Stevens uses the "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic transfer pieces.
This sixth ordinary studio album is still widely organized, but carried by programted sequences or beats and plays with various effects and halls.
When the smaller clubs have disappeared, the stage shows will become the colorful spectacular of Neon star bands and large fluorescent stage co.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is part of a five-headed band through Germany.
More held in the dark Hamburger!
The theatre has mainly presented the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although nearly 2000 guests are now fired in their chairs, Stevens will return to intimacy and people.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
You hear from the audience: The lecture is "opuler" and you can thus throw the "platte in principle".
First to a gift, Steven's modest thanks, plays acousticly few older songs, and eventually rejects themselves under a thrilling applause.
Jeremy Corbyns Debuut at the Question Time of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyns Debuut has been expected to be excited at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister.
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is supposed to give his debut at the premier's question time and start up with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will raise himself in order to ask the first of his six questions, shortly after lunch, which is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour Members from the vicinity.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it will come to the member of the Shadow Cabinet after his appointment and after his speech at the TUC year's meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour Chairman's decision to persist on Tuesday during the singing of the National Hymne at a Memorial on the 75th anniversary of the battle of Britain in silence provoked criticism of a number of tory-MPs and is at the centre of several title-side stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national chamber has focused on himself
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said he had "standed in a respectful silence" and he recognized the "Heldendom of the Royal Air Force in the Air War around England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national chamber, "independence" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr. Corbyn said to the TUC conference that Labour has made changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow-work and pension minister said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman who has been against David Cameron since he was the Tory Chair over the dispatch box in Parliament last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30 000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's questioning time is too confrontative and that he is being abandoned both "frequency" and the dispute with rehearsal and has instead taken to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate, for example when Mr Cameron is on his way abroad.
He also brought the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the word, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker of the underhouse, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from the policy in the style of a "Kasperle theatre" which is often linked to the question time of the Prime Minister. But a few years later he admitted that he failed.
Since it was first sent to television in 1990, the question time with the Prime Minister was considered as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leader in the sub-house and his position among his colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and need far-reaching reforms.
'Shots in Joburg': Homeless young people trained for photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a hard place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus deserve living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg ge(er)shots) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youths how to take pictures of their surroundings and gain a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds increase by accelerating wages growth in the United Kingdom
The pound grew by data that shows an increase in the wage growth in the United Kingdom. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller command target.
Between May and July, the result without bonus in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same previous period.
This percentage has been the fastest rate since 2009 and has been estimated at the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and was climbed to €1.3730 by 0.84 % compared to the euro.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20% after the acquisition offer of the rival AB InBev had received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch together.
Burberry acts were 0.9% higher after encouraging news by the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales numbers hit all expectations and also showed that the turnover in China - a key market for Burberry - again indicates growth.
Shares of Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said that he took $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of Mondi's packaging and paper group were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after the Goldman Sachs' assessment for the company Rating was set to "sell".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company had reported an excess result of 46.6 million for the half of the year.
The chief of JD Sports says higher wages threaten the expansion.
The manager of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the bags of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchase force will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the JD Sports expansion plans, he added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lepish 21 years old, a wrist with upper shark hair.
The guy with the platinum-blond hair is 100 million euros hard.
More than that.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 turns through.
Like Wikitoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanyed Justin yesterday.
These include Ewa and Viktora from Poland.
Since 7 p.m., however, the police have been sitting on the cold stone plates forming Berlin luxury hotel at the Potsdam place.
The Bieber building: Here you live idol, whose poster is hanging up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs exactly as much on the day as their mother Ewa deserves in half a year.
Anyway.
It says, "My Wikitoria would actually have to sit in the tenth class in the gym."
"I'll fill her with a dream."
School duty?
Who's dressing it?
Not the fans.
Neither bee itself.
He's got it out anyway.
For the advertising in the advertisement break of the superbowls, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company washed many, many dollars on the bieber account.
And every puppy that looks like he and goes over the shop table also discards beeber.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're stumbled at the window slide.
More than 100 million he's supposed to have exploited that way.
Some say the Hype went too far.
Others emphasize that bieber was finally just in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" at place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida placat brings Libanesians to cartopee island idea
Potatoes or dances?
It goes both - and in the Kartoffel Islands, which the Oldenburg Imbise Owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the word "Cartoffel instead of Daner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay potatoes and meat have put together on a spoon.
On the idea, a poster brought him at a Pegida demonstration with the label "Cards instead of Danish", which he had randomly seen on TV.
Since then, in his store, a barbecue shot that has been covered with meat and potatoes.
"That's multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
In the meantime, the idea of the Libanese has been entered at the Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a pattern of use.
Therefore, how much meat and how many potatoes of the spices are contained, Alhay does not want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary international understanding is also good for his customers.
Metcash starts ground-sitivity campaign to combat Aldi-incidence
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA filials from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food large dealer Metcash has launched a soil stability campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in front of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand by mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as on events like Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice creator Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA cargos and store owners, selling the awarded tickets for the South Australian football lig to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesale dealer performs his annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA shops and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorically provinceal and IGA retailers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analyzers like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after opening its first markets and remove all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to one report published this week, the Analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million sales per year and metcash $250 million until the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and the amounts on metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million profits before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told me at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which provide approximately 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction at simultaneous pressure on turnover and margins.
However, the wholesale dealer fights and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their shops through faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private labels.
Metcash's main business manager Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop sales programmes will be applied to Elan and hopes that the wholesale dealer will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kirgios and, according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves rather praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger one of the talented duos, called "Special Ks" again and again, led by the famous confrontation of Kirgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon afterwards, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, Harrison exclaimed: "Wawrinka had to beat Kirgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen how he crushed a tennis killer after a catastrophe conquered a potential US-open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth around the second place separately behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup half-finale against Britain.
"One thing I'm quite contemplating about is the fact that I think that Thanasi was a little introduced into the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a hit when he lost a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player who broke a beat of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US-Open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around himself, he has a great family around himself, and I think he was treated a little too strict.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the outfit area, he is trained hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account the important pre-decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right thing for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component."
"First we want the team to be fully focused on competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," healy said.
And I think Nick has very quickly succeeded in the rise, which people like Federers and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understandable the consequences of his action. Some time outside the light of the ram, where he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it's best for the crew and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary explains emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegally into the country. Everything with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in no one country and responded to Serbian officials with resentment.
The people who had escaped from violence stuck on the road for an unknown time in a land strip between the two control points of the countries and built tents and left down there.
But frustrations grew up.
When a police helicopter swept over them, the migrants scanned "Opens the border!" and screamed insults against the Hungarian preparedness police.
Some showed back food and water from protest.
Serbia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that it was "inappropriate" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, and more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbien) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The Turbulenzen at the Hungarian-Serbian border did not agree a day after the 28-National Block at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40 000 people who were seeking refuge in the overwhelmed Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that the EU countries would eventually take up 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary, by the end of the year.
The Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special European Union summit to discuss the continent's immigration crisis on Tuesday.
Hungary, however, did not set its hopes for a soon Brussels or its neighbours action.
On Tuesday, the emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis, so that they could lock roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, however, said that his country also plans the construction of a stacked thread tan along its border to Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the stachel wire zone between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, Hungary has become a significant passport and a point of entry into the European Union.
Minister Viktor Orban, however, claimed that most of the arriving economic refugees are in the search for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or damage to the 4 meters (13 feet) high tone that the government built along the southern border to Serbia, a crime. These laws also impose higher penalties for condemned human dealers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the emergency state," said the government speaker Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border transition is a crime.
Parliament must continue to agree procedureally on the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, National Security Advisor for Orban, said that authorities took 45 people in trying to cross the border, 15 others had already entered deeper into the country.
They come over by harming the fence, they are now in police guards and are accused of criminal offences in accordance with the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the sauna quickly.
The Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with stalk wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border transition near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to press in there.
Approximately 20 managed to come in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
election-2016: Hillary Clinton's spring in front of Bernie Sanders in national survey halved
The former US Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit front in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins you on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic electorates in the preselections (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, by 27 percent (increase by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the President's office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic electorates.
More than five months before the beginning of the preselections, most democratic electorates say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained some profits.
Clinton holds a great advance in women and moderates, but these suggestions have been reduced.
Your support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only behind with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic electors under 50 years of age has evacuated, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, has a great advance in the older electorates.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-digit propulsion with the liberals, but Sanders has now a 5-point propulsion in this group.
About half of the democratic electorates across the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Maybe not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic with her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiasticly support them.
While 48 percent of the democratic electorates say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less republikan electorates say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporter is asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most frequently answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the opinion that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with problems and electorality is also quoted.
Since the Vice-President throws a potential for the President's office into the scale, 57 percent of the democratic electorates want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not.
If democratic electors are asked who would be their second choice for the party, bids are at the top.
About Clinton's followers say more than half that bids would be their second choice far before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to candidate for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's spring before Sanders, from 20 points with bids in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-fifty percent of the democratic electorates see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the choice, but this number has fallen of 78 percent last month.
Bid is at a distance a second at this measurement, but the percentage that views it as the "selectable" has risen.
Nevertheless, in the question of what is more important in a candidate, democratic electorates call questions about electorality.
Like the last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate is inappropriate for these electoral electorates.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates offer good results in some important features in the electoral electorates of their party.
Most view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong management qualitys.
Biden cuts the best off with honesty in the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have any opinion about it.
Democratic electorates of pre-electoral elections generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in harmony with their views.
For all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic electorates have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server continue to be asked as Minister for Foreign Affairs during the term of office, most democratic electorates are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions at all.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about one third is satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversies had no impact on their general opinions by Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsened.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views have become worse by Clinton.
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and trustworthy by the electorates of their party, this remains a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent view them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the electorates do not think they are a honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the electorates across the country also consider Trump not honest and untrusted.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good notes on lead.
From the six tested candidates cut Biden, Carson and Bush best with honesty.
A majority thinks Sanders is more honest, but as with Carson, many people have no opinion about him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic electors in the preselections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump in a country-wide survey
Ben Carson is located at the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
For the two candidates, half of the support of the electorates in the new survey is now available, and others lose a dramatic stop.
Republican voters continue to support trump in large numbers across the country. The support grows from 23% in the last CBS survey, which was carried out before the Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The survey also revealed that Carson arrives well in demographic groups and exceeds trump among Republican electorates with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsins Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the most deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
The former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, is on the third place with 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson increases in the surveys - he lands at 19% support for the Republicans, behind the trump with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
In view of a carson rising in the last week, Trump found some sides for the former neurochirurgs, even after Carson excused himself for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Delicious bathroom temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean area is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough to find even warm water.
A bath in the North or East Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some don't go to the sea anymore: Maximum 18 degrees have the water in the North and East Sea this week, informs the German Weather Service (DWD).
Bath temperatures, however, continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea: In the east, it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic, it is at the top of 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt arrives at 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood charged with the death of a baruch college-newling
Almost two years after a student died during a chicanous ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, mortality is submitted against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, informed the police.
Officers said that he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pounds of sand and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headache, then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi brotherhood did not call on the emergency number 911 after Deng became unauthorized and supposedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and Andy Menge, to contact the national president of the brotherhood to get advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"On this point, the members began to hide outensiles and put the well-being of the brotherhood principally about that of Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.
He could not be resurrected, and he died on his injuries the next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with stunning power injuries to head, rump and bowl.
"Too many families were destroyed by the schicans of the brotherhood. At least one student dies on the schicans since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be accounted for, and this step is very important by authorities.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-grade charge for the first five members.
Twenty-thirds of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of schicanous attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We want not only to make the people involved responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or inappropriate - has sanctified this, we will also draw them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its belonging to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest comes, and the houses are going to wander, return for loans will increase, and the economy will run into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within 11 months of the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressivity of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial assets respond.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when they start to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
However, at the end, market participants could find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the fed since the global financial crisis will unavoidably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "pair money", said Julian Jessop, Chef of Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interests to normal heights, but still to be too low to lead to seismic shock, which many seem to fear.
This does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here is an outlook based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen last month, the pre-administration of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that asset earnings will be cancelled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which might reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche-Bank-analytics in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the fed.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in upward trends - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase, rather flat in the 250 days afterwards (a average profit of 2.6 per cent), then back to normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 per cent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Investment Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management at Barron's.
The German Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begin to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often promote interest increases.
In the present case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that were not before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the case of an increase in interest rate of fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, at the 118 interest increases since 1950, the nominal GDP was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, only few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic sculpture could be risky and raise the question: "If this time it is different," said the German Bank.
Market participants have taken up the whole year on an increase in the interest rate of fed, and all the eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategics and economists believe that the FOMC could authorise an increase in this meeting, the future trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all elevation cycles from 1950 to today have occurred in a super cycle with an increasing fluctuation of GDP, and pre-recession heights have been very quickly placed in the shadow after the start of the restoration," the report says.
In contrast, this is a clear slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is far the longest that the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatil, as the market leads to an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on borrowing is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of loans, the return seems to change direction once the first increase/decline occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the elevation cycle the investors fall immediately, said the German Bank.
The strategies of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer collapse of return between longer and shorter loans and lead to a breakdown of the curve.
High interest loans often bring better profits in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher profits," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profit curve is flat, loan spans have expanded and volatility has increased - all the features of the market when the Fed intensifies its strategy.
Overall, companies that are taking advantage of the largest part of their business in the United States will benefit from increasing interest rates and become more attractive for local products.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse, as an increase in dollars makes their products more expensive on the global market as well as the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "qualitys-" shares tend to react very positively three months after a initial interest increase," said Goldman Sachs analyst in a report to customers.
With a strong balance sheet, companies with a weak balance sheet have exceeded averagely 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Enterprises with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality pendants by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Debts will be a major problem.
Enterprises with a high share of flexible interest will lose most, said Goldman.
Besides the pure share games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Sparer could see gains through higher yields, even if experts have different opinions about how fast this will take place.

The conservative Member of Parliament criticized the transmitter for its "dumbation"
He argues that he is increasingly not to distinguish from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated the British
Parliament's college Damien Collins attacked the mission The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading Member of the Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private transmitter is not doing.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC boss that the public-law radio broadcaster was "verdumm" and increasingly no longer to distinguish from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to change Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be under a different name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples, in which you actually just imitate what is already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director rejected the claims and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public information.
What I learn from Radio 3, I'll learn about classic music nowhere else.
And there is an engagement for live music and music that is really inextreme.
"And to find the commitment of Radio 3, new music and to order new works, I also think really important," he said.
In the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work was needed to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of BBC production which, during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports, was under fire to put the commercial rivals on their feet.
The tory member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of BBC, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly significant?
Lord Hall claimed that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "in particular BBC-wise".
He added that he wishes the company to find "a hit from our home-owned stable" when it starts a entertainment series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet turnovers increased the slowest in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
Online sales increased by using mobile phones for shopping three years ago
Experts believe that the Black Friday braked the expenses in November
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been a tree, and many of the main shopping streets in the UK have turned into spirit cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online conversions are staggering after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 by only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are staggering after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go down until 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to purchase their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is inclined, and we may experience a reduction in growth.
The Black-Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is quoted as a reason for the abandoning transactions.
Experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases back before this event, which will take place each last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of purchasers around their computers was five times to make their laptops, and some traders' websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers were fighting for sniffs, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that from 5 pounds of expenses some more than 1 pounds online was spent.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the interior cities.
Muslims buried in Mekka at the cran accident killed - Bin Laden's family is sanctified
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia causes the breakdown part of the huge Saudi-Bin-Laden group
The Ministry of Health said that 394 people were also injured in total after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed into Mecca’s big mosque.
The sad ones filled, largely dressed in white, the route to count their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem Peaceyard.
The mourning procession moved over at the Holy Place, where only days before a crane of building crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the beds.
The bodies were released for the funeral, when the Saudi king penalized a sanction on the building company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beetles who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Moshes Mekkas were carried through the streets.
Among the dead were Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the year's Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly said that the Haddsch to Mekka will continue with thousands of people who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group shouldn't have left the arm of the crane when he was not used.
A Arabic version of the Dekret, published by the State Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Laden group is responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was prohibited from traveling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman praised to reveal, which caused the crash of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the big mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the Haddsch, which is later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not make any statements on the de Krans collapse and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also deceived the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Thousands of cranes surrounded Mekka's big mosque as part of the massive construction project, which is directed by the bin-laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a deceitful son, who was disfellowshipped by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is needed at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officers said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that one million rial (£174.000) should be paid to the members of the killer and the same sum to permanent injury.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly occupy craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 other Screwfix wires targeting craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales stations across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that British put down their inhibitors and brush in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
If you can handle with a hammer or brush to strike walls, you seem to be a minority today.
Increasingly, Britain employs craftsmen to carry out home workers jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new manager of Kingfisher, who has the construction market chain, said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at lowest prices has been overcome.
Consequently, Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Screwfix shops that are addressed to craftsmen and to close 60 B&Q sales stations.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to occupy more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women.
At the moment, the staff overweigh the men.
She said it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that have more female single budgets that take more renovation than in the past.
Mrs Laury said, "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We need to move this more to a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also converted her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in lead positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial manager.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher mentioned a decrease in half-year profit and turnovers after the group trained the costs for closing the shops.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who has Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Functionary of Aich/Dob due to unfaithfulness before court
On Wednesday, two employees of the Austrian Volleyball Vice Champion Aich/Dob had to be responsible for unfaithfulness and deduction.
The accused were not guilty.
One of them had also been accused of official abuse.
He was legally freely spoken of this claim in May.
The current process has been broken.
According to Supreme Prosecutor Robert Riffel, in the pre-examination, it had crystallized that the accused people used money from association accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
He describes the damage by around EUR 400.000.
Sport functioners are also accused of financial infringements.
This fact dismissed the Chairman of the Creation, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later time.
The rejection of unfaith declared the defence that the association had not at any time been a defect of assets.
The sport functioners would only have calculated burdens and the sports club for which they were active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the liabilities amounted to approximately 600 000 shilling in 2001 (e.g. EUR 44,000).
"Then we were facing the situation: Do we continue to run the club or lock us on?" said one of the charged, in the bread profession of the financial agency's large business auditor.
With his colleague and fellow-security, he decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have provided money, put our life insurance as a security at the bank," he said in the agreement.
The association had been agreed: you can manage the money freely, it is only not allowed to make any debts.
In addition, in the case of financial success, the payment of the burdens on burdens would be retrospective until 1991.
Therefore, some of the burdens were paid out only years later, from the year 2003 when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, the former Obmann explained the transactions.
The accounts and spare books managed the two accused ones together, said the second charger.
The judge asked why the payments were not disclosed in detail to the association.
The association was not interested in the financial event in detail, it was only important to have been the debt freedom, so the answer.
In 2011, a amount of EUR 120.000 was transferred to the association account when a functional investigator began to investigate for official abuse.
That would have been reserves, declared the accused.
This investment account was on the name of the second accused and was not known to the association according to its statement.
"Why?" wanted the judge to know.
The respondent knew no answer for a long time.
Then he finally thought that he believed that this was the best for the association.
If anything had happened to him, no one would know anything about that money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The complainant had been informed, the functioner justified himself.
This referral was formulated as "repayment of damage".
Why injury?, wanted to know the judge and the prosecutor.
The first accused declared that he had not agreed with this formulation because the association had never been damaged.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "with that you are all out of the cutter."
"Is I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the functionary said that he never paid a cent, he only calculated kilometers and diets.
In diets, he charged 1,000 euros per month to the association, but the actual burden had been much higher, he added.
Exact documentation for the early years could not present the accused.
These were no longer stored after an operating test, where everything was considered to be correctly, they explained.
The second charged had also been paid on kilometers.
All repayments were made in bar and he had to drive from his place of residence the People's Market to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue with the consultation of witnesses on 23 September.
Hewlett-Packard struggles 30,000 more jobs
In addition to the degradation of staff for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the separation of the company.
The posting of the U.S.-computer giant Hewlett Packard (HP) will not end.
In its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its company customers' savings.
This will save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company informed on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will attack from the fourth quarter.
The degradation of 55.000 jobs has not been completed for three years.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP was still employing around 302,000 employees.
The Hewlett Packard acticulously gave up 2.3 percent.
The group grown up with printers from the California Palo Alto is currently split up: This is how the computer and printer business is still to be united in a new society - separated from the more future areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business parts are to be listed on the exchange.
Another disappointing PC set as well as a weaker demand from business customers for its services, the world's second largest PC manufacturer was last added to Lenovo.
In the third quarter of business at the end of July, the sale of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
The turnover fell by 8 percent to almost $25.4 billion.
This resulted in the redemption in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a splitting and massive jobs.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only responded lately that customers strengthen smartphones and tablets instead of buy conventional computers and do more and more businesses at the same time online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide a total reduction of approximately 55.000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports the anti-IS education mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would mostly reject: 54 percent argued that 35 percent were consenting.
That other states fly air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria, 61 percent find positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian powerholder Baschar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be for it.
29 percent were unable to decide.
Car: Second press day on the 66th IAA
The centre of the fair is connected, self-running cars and electrical mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA Auto Association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago.
Voice: outbreak of violence at Serbian Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have operated at the Serbian border at Russian tear gas and water guns against several hundred refugees.
Euronews Correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind there, a police line had been formed and behind the police had a water vacuum.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, stacks and plastic bottles after the officials.
The officials first used uninterrupted pepper spray.
Then the police used tear gas.
Many tear gases were sprayed towards refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have pulled something back awaiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had breathed the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees sucked together and suffered breathlessness.
The Serbian police press speakers also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Note Bank
The world is watching when the US Note Bank meets in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interests are raised or not.
A survey among 80 economists consulted by Reuters found that a little more than half, which was still considered last week, that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will continue a little longer and the interest rates will be maintained at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years ago since the Fed interest sets on NULL.
"For the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generates only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rusty view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to make an increase, but the signs indicate that the opportunities for such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced at 20.00 MEZ on Thursday
Death Guard at Delta State University left an excuse letter
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and later on the day he shot his colleagues and killed - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it was "injury" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it uninjured," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, Doctor for Geography and Social Science Education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the employee of the emergency centre that the police must send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will disturb," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening, when cops surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "naturally there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb argued that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married about seven years.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "destructed on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Pictureiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had met with lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "he's not going to prison."
When cops picked him up on the highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled to the foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University in spring 2015, as his life leave on the website of the University indicates.
Stars who lost their happiness
The actress (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actors also claimed to fight against drugs, and in 2008 he was condemned for drug possession.
It's probably all that calls for his tribute.
Eurowings: Airhansa builds the group on:
The Airhansa plans a large group number construction.
A half billion euros per year want to save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization.
150 of around 1000 headquarters worldwide will cost the group's workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
The Airhansa reconstructs its business structure and maintains Eurowings' cheap-dogs.
The objective of the reorientation was a contribution of approximately 500 million euros per year from cost and redemption synergies, the airline informed on Wednesday.
Among other things, the Airhansa will no longer be a board for the passenger business.
The Eurowings cheap airline was to be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Management Team for Chef Carsten Spohr in the future.
With the reconciliation, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group wants to join against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
To date, the organization of the 120 000 employees of the strong company was complex.
The airlines established under the roof of the Airline Passage Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations will be resumed after the judicial stroke that Thursday.
That told the trade union.
The subject of the discussions is to be the pension scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to "in one year with a forecasted record result" to achieve as soon as possible portable results.
The conflict between union and Airline has led to various strikes in the past few months.
In addition to the transitional supply of pilots, background is the spare concept "Wings".
It provides that the Airhansa is reposing to the Eurowings Concert Billig Line in the fight against competitor routes.
Among the title "Morgenzug in den Süden" are paintings of Leena Krüger in the artist's house.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at Manchester's Champions League nederlage at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left foreign defense to weeping and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The injury was caused by an unreasonable attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had entered the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double bone fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
In the cabin he had an oxygen mask.
It was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red map and the hanging of an eleven meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the prosecutor, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had failed.
You can judge yourself when I say that an eleven meter and a red map were falling.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account said, "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to heal now begins, I get more back."
This was related: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat at the PSV
The Defence of England has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent.
Moreno experienced a bone break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland manship at the WM 2014.
"He does very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury, that is not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going to another direction, so it looked like he had touched him [Moreno], but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I feel very bad about it.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost memorized.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, which appeared in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the SuperCamps company website, and continues: "Looky, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read for my children, because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
Everything nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron claims to describe the act of the book, represents a content in the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed, where all nature has gone and even the air is a product, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey to the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose true name was Theodor Seuss Gisel and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this was not suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins as follows: "In the engraved city of Thneed, where everything is artificial and even the air is a product, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the act of the book. Here a unnamed boy hears the local environment falling by the moneyful, trees, Thneed-slashing one-dozers despite the protest of the named Lorax, a hobbling, snoring creature, "which speaks in the name of the trees," is destroyed.
It is most likely that such a relatively low PR task has been delegated to a helper who has not read The Lorax 20 times in a child.
A Downing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's circuit office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Camerons employees, but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
Stuffing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the border that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test serial downlay is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outward victory.
Alastair Cook's page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear herbs of 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Message related to this: Adam Lyth separates from the England-Test-Kader and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, hard to analyze for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
At his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, where - and I have said this before - players are their own best choosers.
Long ago one would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had the control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he strikes out further runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not provide good performance, and that is not surprised me; he is especially a team man.
The question how much time a test-slave gets to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only punishment that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trotch in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a struggle I'm very much estimating.
He is a X factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early in this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which met us very much.
It must have at least the same opportunities as before it, but this depends, of course, on the formation of teams in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of making Moeen beat next to Cook, which would bring a extra spin buwler and get four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing to do with it.
I don't see why a struggle can't beat there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a devil boy of Cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before acting as an opener in 2001.
He did three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as a back-up spinner, and in my limited association with him, he impressed me as a young man very much.
People may look at their statistics - average 31 with the beating and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spiders that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a few smart supplements at the trainer stack.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the best guys in the game who will bring a lot of experiences, since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the Setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the cabin, even if the news is in line with the previous said.
Collys team colleague at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One-Dayers, root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team composers do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly in heart.
The Brexit-Lager (Brexit = Departure of the United Kingdom from the EU) could gain a chance if the economy operates in a flaute by 2017
David Cameron's unequivocal new negotiations strategy to keep Britain in the EU is deeper in trouble every day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is severely crushed because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply interrupted in different crises, as the EU is now and not always for their own fault, the United Kingdom's own agenda with split concessions and disturbing changes in contracts, which they mostly do not want, is satisfactory.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it even if they threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie-Agenda.
Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outlooking United Kingdom inside the EU's tent - "Let's not alone with France," says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capital cities have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautionate office, Angela Merkel, is an alliance, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it has happened to those excessive long enduring such as Thatcher (11 years), Middle edge (14) and Coal (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-elective or replacement in 2017.
He's also a bloody force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will rip out a leg to help the selfie letters whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from the UK - something they do not want because most of them have similar separatist trends.
Therefore, some such ministers may intend to plan not even helpful comments, entirely in the SNP style, while the UK referendum campaign in 2017, to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The new negotiation was a Pleite" and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the new negotiation."
The Europeans know how robberically the Fleet Street can be at its expense and what EU creators are the Oligarch of the Pressebarone, as they were, but not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can remember weakly Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunist, who made a name as a "EU-line banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-frightening shoes, telephone-haking foreigners and the pseudo non-inlanders, which have most of our large newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar to them, but found that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract it instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair had put the principle of the unaccepted constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door.
The press has never deceived him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly knock on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need time to spend me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's Boykott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake at the time and today.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I express it kindly - in the development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips' traditional blue colouring trend and the wilderly filled of Tory's Small Englishism may say yes to everyone.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn in the radio and television this week, when the path finder fought in him, not admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provoking John McDonnell as a shademan was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be unfair to his worker cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor was what JC told his fellows and Members after all reports at their clause meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the touchful bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the scatter of social media, a breakfast of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to not give Cameron a free card for Europe, which allows him to hold Labour's support in the referendum campaign for an independence, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins probably thinks that way.
However, McDonnell and Corbyn's basic ambiguities regarding the EU membership - in line with their bennite capacitation economy, its anti-kapitalist past - are not just a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its multiplicity to Nato - Tom Watson, rocksenfest is convinced that JC will not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their supervisors at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mistrust choosers - to make concessions to the British if all of this can be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction in the Tory government's power, which I was remembered at the start of Monday, something called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Report by Public Health England on E-Cigarettes
The claims of a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 persons, partly linked to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Grundsatzbericht" last month and describes it as "a comprehensive verification of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the burden on data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "exceptionally windy base" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims "construct on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that the claim of PHE that "the best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for a multi-criteria-decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) in order to lead their opinions on the damages of various nicotin-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health whose manager was expected to have received from British American Tobacco Mittel (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting declared that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette producer, but not the funding he had expected to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports before.
The reasons for selecting the members of the body are not provided, but include several known E-Cigarette champions, some of which also indicate a industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The tobacco leadership of PHE also took part in the meeting.
The research work of the group "is significantly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there are no evidence that e-cigarettes were early served as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers".
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ have already been responded.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to to tobacco.
Almost 80.000 people die annually of a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system 2 billion £ a year.
Through the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former commander of Channel 4
The former Chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transmitters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public law programmes, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard-controversial times against the most popular shows of their rivals and of broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to make more partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that for six years in his time, he tried to contact Channel 4 without success with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC is offering or sending programmes that would also be clearly shown by non-subsidiated rivals," said Johnson, the Oberhaus-Communication Committee, in the context of his study on the future of BBC.
If you want to hold the broadcast fee, which I don't think in the middle or long term is a good idea, you should at least make your production on programs that do not make or order others.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that anyone else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course crazy.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax programme is financed, which could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, as a matter of per se both own productions.
Actually, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is guilty of hunting for ratings "for the ambitions of people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC reflect what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the more public-law Nischen programs should "go to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience, but they're fulfilling their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their sheltered missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we have created all these obcised programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the broadcast fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think you get a big value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, ask me if that is true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5-Chef David Elstein, who also said before the Committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reitian mission to "form, form and entertain".
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should take an example of the public television broadcasters in Australia and Canada to change this to "informing, informing and entertaining".
As to the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the proms of which he said that only one handful is shown in the TV, and with the commercial broadcasters allians to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematods change the direction at the moment in which they are radiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The small nematods change the direction at the moment in which they are radiated with sound impulses that have too high frequency for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by activating motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More about this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetic, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that the procedure one day could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasound waves that then enter the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves enable the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned, such as a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematods, Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4-ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are strengthened by the microblosss and transferred into the worms where they turn the modified motoneurons on.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a path breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons with light impulses.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages against this technology.
Unlike light, which needs to be sent down to the desired point in the brain, low frequency ultra sound waves can pass unhindered tissue and can thus be sent into the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The advertisements harm the United Kingdom's arms trade
See Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen-Video.
Frightened murderer drowns!
Footstroke crushing legs!
Strohing bombs!
And electric shock sticks that cause painful pain, but leave no trace!
The joyful voice and the cartoon pictures leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a fighting parodie produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government's willingness to abandon weapons to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) read in the fonts of the London Underground and the marks of the DLR line, which walks into the picture of a tank.
In September a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum for cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collection named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £-pack of inbus keys, which is claimed that "access is about one third of the bus stops' business areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this Plakater-"Vandalism" fun.

After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and Doctor at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of gallery.

The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100.000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, who works with the graphic and voiceover artists who also works free of charge.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed on the silence that reigned around the advertising for the arms trade fair - through a space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic twin company advertising, but "through the blowing in with bright colors and animation it remains more liable."
"They made a fantastic job by helping us to sharpen our consciousness about the sale of illegal torture devices on the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the entering of the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not illegally handled before our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms knife comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors make fantastic euphemistic products worse.

Eight gold rules for life in student homes
11 years ago, I moved to a student home, still in faith in Berets and moral relativeism, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those who I have annoyed - and the many long breathing complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be destilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance in student homes is sufficient from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to sweat: people tell where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you " honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because seriously, boys, it's just a hip extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you wouldn't talk to, even if your whimpers were fired and these fire cleaners were.
Let people go.
The rooms of people are often transformed into drinking receptions, film-night locations and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and reconcile their underwear.
Referring to this: Do not think of starting a relationship to the university
Introverted receive a gross treatment at the university.
Her room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a room-to-room bomb culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I've consumed for interaction with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone of society is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead of knocking.
Apropos: Do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the climax of the back-many, knocking at the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of Brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome in the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade leckery is a good way to close friendships.
Your residents feel obliged to entertain and may at the end associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed clumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clay of chickens is a steal, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it is angry, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my fellow inhabitant who added a dishwasher to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that in the true sense of the proverb you belong to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbors whether it would make them something to put Drum & Bass a little silent, for it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They reacted to it with even more loud music.
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep two hours before she let her own music plunder, closed her door and went to her three - hour trial.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally enter the same student home?
On the other hand, it would not be deeply embarrassing if you held a companion for your future spouse, joined her, divorced and then had to see her every day and maybe see how she moves over to her all the common friends?
Of course, the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot companion is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to discuss your substance a little sense.
In the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the limit between an ulk and mobbing is more nice than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a tree rank.
Give a valuable and entertaining lesson about security through hiding - but never suck someone's room with toothpasta and shampoo.
Close their door, and put their keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but take their property on the roof not more than twice.
Row houses for refugees, single-owned, low-valued
The real estate operator Markus Gildner builds series houses for people who don't have much money in the mid-French cornertal.
So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need a living room, but also the only adult mother and the low-valuer."
"I show how you can still build cheap and good today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push to the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly a favourable living room can be created: he builds series houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push on to the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or tour halls has no sustainability.
For the people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the refugee flow, we also need enough living space in the next decades.
A very banal, three-story row house is the solution.
Gildner: A series house needs the least place.
It facilitates integration.
It's different if you're bringing people into living blocks.
Each of the six houses that are just built in the pilot project consist of three units of living for four asylum applicants each.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living area per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's overlookable.
Six months have lasted the building.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I have done my project correctly.
Especially complicated, it always makes the threatening damocular sword special construction and the settlement regulation.
Cruel.
It is still undergoing that the one who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities there is no place for this.
And refugees and asylum applicants have no cars.
How did the residents react to their series house project?
Gildner: There were those who pretended me to create luxury buildings for asylum applicants.
What is definitely wrong.
But don't you intensify the competition for payable apartments?
Gildner: We have had a construction tree in Germany in the last five years, but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, the normal people also need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the only mature mother or the low earner.
I show how you can still build cheap and good today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first worked on environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have found problems after installing, as they receive an error message that announces that the "software update failed" has failed.
To deal with the problem, users are recommended to wait either until the crash goes back or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it unlikelyer by removing the update. Similarly, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may switch off halfways and this could lead to an interruption of the update.

Rosberg's only devis: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one devise in the battle for the WM title in the formula 1 against his clear leader Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton, "full attack".
The WM section stressed before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the vice-world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from the Defence and Double Champion Hamilton.
The British won seven of the previous twelve seasonal races and also attacks the Flood Light-Grand-Prix in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
Whether the current Smog in the city state will influence the great price of Singapore, it is still unclear.
For days a dark bell hangs over the city, triggered by fires on the neighbouring Sumatra island.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The three months ago chess club "Schachfriende Bad Kissingen" has added another member to his series, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kissingen more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is a member of the First Class and honorary citizens of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that the Chairman Alfred Klein received.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot contribute to the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent search are also intended to be advanced.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership of the chess club and also friendship contact with the tennis club "Rot-White" should be seen as an expression of his relationship with the Kurstadt.
Office searches for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift Old Center have joined themselves under the deck of the social foundation and opened a new gate at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More precisely, at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
There was a new office recently opened.
Here, right next to the shopping market, you will immediately receive seniors and advisory information on questions such as health insurance or healthcare services.
For years, with our ambulance care service, we have found that often plowing families are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Apartly many of the services of the cash are not used, because the complexity of insurance is hardly yet understood," explained the new houselord Jutta Weigand, who, as a business sector leader, is also responsible for the Anthony and the civil hospital as well as for the ambulant service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end, the Saludis was taken to the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as crash prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis are perfectly complemented.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and reha.
"The Senior Center for Care and Care", Heike Riedel, CEO of Saludis, described.
The reason for opening the new quarter office in the city centre is to see both managers especially in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the various parts of Bamberg in the future essential.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the dedication celebrations, the quarter office also dedicated to the meeting in the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular convenience."
In this way, the Social Foundation contributes greatly that the elderly can live as independent and well in their familiar environment as possible.
The quarter office is opened Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 pm to 18 pm and Saturday from 10 pm to 12 pm.
Introduction Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the game FC Entrucht Bamberg against the third-liedist Würzburger Kickers had not yet been established, the date was now set on 6 October.
The meeting of the FC Entrance Bamberg in the eight-finale of the Bayerian football Totopokal against the third-legist FC Würzburger Kickers was now finally terminated.
Plays on Tuesday, October 6, at 19.00 in the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium.
"We are pleased that we know when the game is about the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE Team Manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now started card pre-sale.
It's something special for our team to play against a third-list.
We therefore hope for a number of viewers, and this is not without reason, because flood light games have a special irritation.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg in 2010 reigned by victory at the district legend 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against regional ligists 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive EUR 5000 and qualify for the first round of the DFB Association Pokal 2016/2017.

Vienna architect Karl Mang 92-year-old died
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of the Vienna architecture, is dead.
He died already on September 5, at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With many, the artists' house loses a honourable member and at the same time "a of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
In 1922, many were born in Vienna, studying architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a free - creation architect, but he was also a teacher, writer and institute leader.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the establishment of the treasure chamber in Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz to the Austrian theatre museum.
Park punishment: Tim Wiese incurs police with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has not noticed it in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, Ex-National Torhüter in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, is engaged in wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have added, according to his own statement, in the last two years.
Intellektually, however, he did not add.
Wheat was just cutting the hair in the Bremer Innenstadt when he saw an outdoor parking room guardian put out a penalty for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wheat then stormed from the business, insulted the officer and threw her the penalty before the feet, as the "Image" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the punishment, but it is not yet clear about the consequences of the unusual incident.
"The matter is still in the test," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will be decided whether to show Wise or not.

Men invade 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden to Salmünster.
One from the group, a 17 - year - old Afghane, followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the height of the bft tank station.
In the area of the tank station, three people also stayed.
One of these men now cried to the youths and hit it with the faust in the face.
The victim suffered a broken nose and bleeded strongly out of his nose.
When his two friends approached and proudly spoke to the struggle, he first left his victim.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The actor persecuted the group with a car to its apartment and went there several times demonstratively.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked by the struggler and another male person.
Assisted with a strike, the face and the upper bowl of the victim were inclined.
The injured person had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
To date, there is only a vage description of actors.
One of the men was about 1,80 feet tall.
The second stroke is supposed to be about 1,65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and advisors to report to the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes practitioner Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
It is also a joy for Samtgemeinde Bürgermeister Bernd Bormann, economic supporter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Mayor Heinfried Kabbert of Asendorf.
In many places in the country lacking doctors - Asendorf, however, has happiness: There Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still on his side in the next months with half a job.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on October 12, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises at the St.-Marcellus Street 6.
It was sympathy at the first glance when the Felstehausens had known Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who currently graduates her medical training in the Verdener Hospital and wants to get into practice next year.
"We always had in the back that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was done, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea to operate his own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
As a benefit he also sees to be his own boss soon.
And so one agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two-fold family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a supervisor in Sulingen, and he was also ordered to be the head of an emergency physician in the Diepholz circle in 2009 and is honorarily involved in the DRK Board of Brochhausen-Vilsen.
The practice will be prepared for the new boss from 19 September.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a home doctor, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle themselves as home doctors.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongol.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and load EKGs and need a talk room more.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total grant of EUR 50000 will be granted to the wasters in the framework of a support programme from the district (EUR 25000) as well as from the municipality (12500 euro) and the municipality (12500 euro).
"That shows how proud and happy we are that practice is being continued," emphasizes Samtgemeinde Bürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come into practice in Felstehausen, in the North German average practice it is about 500.
There is another practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice overtake by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no follower had found it would have gone too.
By the way, who visits Müller's speaking hours continues to look mainly in familiar faces: take over the seven medical staff and the cleaning force from the Felstehausens.
By their departure in Asendorf, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel rock houses are thrillingly remembered.
A little mourning she feels after the long time.
"But we live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients more often," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughing, "We have a 6000 square metres base."
"Bisher I always pressed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the pair has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees"
"Now the border controls are also going up at our southern border," said Innenminister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
Controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can do this "self-understanding".
The supply and safety of human beings are at the forefront.
Of course, the minister said, "that there is a need for clear signals."
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration streams, even over the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "Corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously notified, and Slovenia also wanted to let incoming refugees go to Austria and Germany and may also create corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the case of the interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify the monitoring of the border - especially for Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia has already been strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
But as the minister stressed, Slovenian does not want to set its limits on refugees.
"Every EU member must fill out its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to pass the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid in Eastern Croatia during the night hours to avoid registration.
The Croatian police could attack them in the nearby maize fields.
According to local media, in the Croatian Tovarnik, police vehicles with new refugees have been regularly engaged.
It is mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country was counted with about 4000 refugees, said Inner Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be transferred to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade argued that it was to instruct people to take certain routes: "We can neither, nor we want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city Sid in the early early, and further buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inhabitants had traveled through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue travelling to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to a slightly further western route by observers to move the past Balkan-Route Turkey-Greeceland-Mazedonia-Serbien-Hungary.
Croatia: "Governmental opportunities for border control"
Croatia's Inner Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong flow of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "reasonable opportunities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007, and the EU partners have been presenting a good witness to the country since then as regards the standard of border controls.
On Serbian side, about 300 refugees continue to be trapped behind the Hungarian border sauna.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they would have spent last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border transitions Horgos and Backi Breg remain fully locked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to move to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Inner Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday at a local eyelight in Horgos: he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border has now closed.
It would not be very high rates of refugee at present.
It is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute to refugees maps on which alternative routes are registered by Croatia.
However, the cross-border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, there are still unclear mining fields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mining spacers was sent to the border region.
Börsen-Hacker: Ukrainian pays $30 million
Supranonok is supposed to have heard of a ring of cybercriminates who have been conceived to have ever again insight into yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
Insider transactions on financial markets should have been made with the information provided.
In this way, the investigators claimed that more than $100 million were collected.
"The present comparison shows that even those outside our borders are finally captured," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other accused persons in the case continued.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The actors are supposed to have acted out both in the United States and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenic Hospital Assistance Mannheim has been present for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz, there is a rough operation.
People make their concerns, partly fast steps, partly cozyly fumbling.
They control the two stations of Mannheimer Autosalon at the Paradeplatz.
Hold city trails.
Pulsating, stunning life at a beautiful autumn sunlight and in the middle of four large tables each with the title "Before I want to die"....
The Economy Hospital Assistance made this action aware of its 20-year-old existence and is facing mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went into the city and among the people with the action," says Josephine Lamer.
The head of the Economy Hospital Assistance is also available to the passengers for questions and conversations as well as the honorable employees.
While some people spontaneously grab a Passover to the crème and the sentence of "yes my life", "read", "walk through the U.S. camper", "stop war" or "not long suffering", others stay short, read, say phrases like "as far I am not yet" and then continue.
At the end of the day, small discussions on the action are on the part of itself, on life, on dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"It is only if I make it clear that at some time the end of this world comes, I can live responsible," says the director of the Diaconic Work of Mannheim, who is together with the Caritas Association with the Ecumenic Hospital Assistance.
This public action is therefore good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, but be understandable, eventually it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and death is still arrested with Tabus, so the experience of Josefine Lamer, although just the Hospital Movement has contributed much to the opening of people in recent years.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and grief companion belongs to the honorable employees of the first hour.
By personal experience confronted with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in death aid.
When the Ökumenic Hospital Assistance was looking for honor officials by call, it immediately reported and had been with in the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honourable men - 43 women and two men - accompanying the affected and family members in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They're all trained carefully.
Angelika Godefroid can handle their task and experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another wait, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ökumenic Hospital Service is free of charge and confession independent.
The financial support of the hospital banks and donations of members and associations enables training and training and supervision of death and grief companions.
Every two years training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be listed on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial prospects reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its profit perspective to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to rent about 55.000 seasonal workers for vacation.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company wanted to suspend 50.000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket deal 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected, according to a FactSet survey, $10.84.
Despite the price increases that are averaged 4.9 per cent and will become effective on 4 January, and despite higher land transport contributions from heavy and large packages raised from November.
The company said that however, it expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "consumes solid profits if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS, which plans to set up 90 000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which foretold twelve of Zacks Investment Research analyzers.
Turnover increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks examined analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has a decrease in the international priority shipment which has brought sales in its unit of Express shipment to the stacking.
But the tree in the online shop has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in soil transport increased by 29 percent, but the operational result was essentially flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-surance.
The Express unit reported higher income due to higher prices, while the result of higher labour costs in the freight business decreased.
In the premarket deal, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategen spends two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the rate for the first time for almost a decade.
A wall picture of the United States is on the end of the decorated, two-stage session hall.
The map is a reminder of the fact that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and their colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a dual order from the Congress: maximising the US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start to be used by the exampleless incentive by the short-term interest rate close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that they are growing solidly, the recent turbulencies on the global financial markets could make the already careful Fed representatives afraid to increase this volatility by increasing the interest rate for federal loans - and it is only a quarter of the percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing they see," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chef Economy at the maker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a predecession not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself unsures the financial market.
About half of the economists, who have recently been consulted by Bloomberg, have predicted an increase in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect to wait for Fed, with a key indicator, which only shows a 30% chance of increasing.
This indicates a decline in the share market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the Strategories melter the stroke by promiseing that further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped by 228,89 points or 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintained the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chefonom at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "he would have to go very far in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that they could not panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm down the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Another month ago, the fed seemed good to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in slowly sharpening the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints of liberals, that more economic progress would be needed, it would expect an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs slowed down in August, improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate has decreased to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recreation.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can deal with higher interest rates and need them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets all over the world joined the end of last month after China had assessed its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 16% under its peak in May when investors feared that slowing the Chinese economy would threaten global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, whereas the Dow is now nearly 10% below the high in May.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulencies influence the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the cripples at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Note Bank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least one month to get better over the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed Monetary Authority of the world has become.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The only indication of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "single" its monetary expansion, triggered confusions around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly merged with each other, the Fed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to advise with other central banks and experts in order to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the management of assets of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a story of overreactions to financial market movements that seem not linked to the economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is engaged in an increase in interest, quoted decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its leading interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited effects on growth in the United States", said Lacker.
One year later, the Fed representatives rejected these reductions.
The Fed should put into the first place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market crash in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's Committee on Interest Fixing.
The recent turbulencies do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should advance the time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often called Thai Costco and is a large- Thai market which is also sold to the general public.

Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To offer you a warm welcome, is not going without the commitment of countless honorable helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum candidates in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with its 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker's home at the Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a right school.
Brazil’s Child Society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS is trying to shock women about how important good diet is during breast-feeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that sucks on breasts painted with presentations of unhealthy foods.
Both milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnancy and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calories supply is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do.
A current study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sports Hall
The Municipal Council Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattered for solar equipment.
The plans for the long desired tour hall construction at the Bernrieder sports area are step-by-step: In the recent Municipal Council meeting, the draft construction application was one-sided without major discussions.
In the past, the body had decided, inter alia, another application for a construction "exception" and "exemption" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" concerned the permit for a special form of roof construction.
Thus, a "Satteldach with non-mediate first and roof overhead" is to be created.
The background of planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar plants: "This brings us together a wonderful large south roof," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "release" was, again, the ceiling that should be less than ten degrees for energy reasons - different from the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
Therefore, a "release" was needed because the construction plan regarding the ceiling does not allow "exceptions" - where the Bernrieder Municipal Council usually is more restrictive in the case of requests for exemption.
However, it is not a recurring project in turnhall construction: "We do not create any prediction", says Steigenberger.
The tour hall construction at the sports center is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
About 2.3 million euros are calculated at costs.
Subsidies are expected from school and broader sports.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall is now submitted to the country council for testing.
Klinik Pittenberg moves to Schongau
The Pittenberg Hospital is intended to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the Songau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Pittenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, confirmed by the country council Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Council and will be held on Wednesday 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pittenberg would continue to work.
The major majority was to move to Schongau with fishermen and the remaining internal station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who can't go to Schongau are to be offered a job in Weilheim, so Jochner-White.
The employees are informed about the plans.
The change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now switches to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
In the question of who is to join the succession, according to Jochner-White, the name "Fisher" came into the game, who declared ready to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this in any case meant a "upgrade" and a spread of the offer in the field of "Innere Medicine", said Jochner-White.
Fisher is a specialist in heart stepmakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
Transitionally for the next two years, fishermen with his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees to lead both houses, until then next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which has more than 35 beds, should be closed definitively in Pittenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018 when the currently running renovation at the hospital Weilheim was completed.
Landratin Jochner-White, also Chairman of the Supervisory Council, came to announced that the house that is in possession of the Federal Federation is to be used as accommodation for asylum webers in the future.
"That I quit." As it goes on with the property, Jochner-White couldn't say there are several considerations.
There is currently a short-term career of the caritas and a daily psychiatrie.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," said Fischer about the quasi transfer to the Lech, which had been "positive and very understandable" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house in which fishermen have been working as a chief for over 30 years has not existed.
He had been asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the posts of the medical director.
The Pittenberg Hospital (only 100 beds) has been frequently threatened by closing in the past decades, departments were closed, such as surgery and birth assistance.
The handballs of the Rhine Neckar Lions are required tonight (20.15 p.m.) at the mountainic HC.
The leader of the Federal League is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no cause for superiority.
During the last season, the BHC bathers had a painful defeat and had something to do there.
Jagdfall with two injured ones at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured by shots during their maize crops on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Mennten on a maize field at Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in use, as the police announced.
After a shooting, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospitals.
How exactly it could come to the accident was first unclear.
Criminal police detected.
Missed 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Pfalz victims of violence crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Pfalz since Saturday.
In the hearing, the 20-year-old admitted to killing youths and throwing their body into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missed from Rhineland-Pfalz since Saturday has been victimed by a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found in Rockenhausen at Emperor Slauters on Tuesday evening, as an attorney and police announced on Wednesday.
As a suspicion, a 20-year-old who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, who said that it was said and led the investigators to the place of finding the body.
The 16-year-old had been missed on Sunday morning after she had not come home in the evening after a autumn feast in Rockenhausen as agreed.
In searching for the young woman, the investigators first found personal objects of the victim.
Eventually, when consulting the Missed Friends and Knowledge Circle, there was a suspicion of acts against the 20-year-old.
The condemnant then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the arrester, the police hearing admitted to the authorities, the 16-year-olds killed and put the body into the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the prisoner on Wednesday, the investigators put him to the burden of death.
Information on the closer circumstances of the action is intended to bring further investigations.
Refugees need accommodations: Study warns about leakage
The location on the German housing market is excited.
More and more refugees also seek a payable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is a challenge.
Distribution struggles on the German housing market have long started.
With the arriving refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pressing on a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with income-sufficient citizens for the last payable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for payable apartments, 40,000 new units were to be built each year by 2020.
This results in a study on behalf of the Association Association "Social housing building".
For comparison: This year, 260 000 units will be completed in Germany.
That's why we're missing 140.000 apartments.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live in the first three months of their stay as asylum seekers.
Many then run into the housing market and rank into the long snakes before the rental apartments.
However, according to the Statistical Federal Office, less than half of all asylum applicants lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not just the increase in refugee rates.
The study also constitutes significant failures in the housing policy in recent years.
Germany faces a flat deficit that grows from year to year.
At present, some 770.000 residential units were already missing in the urban areas, complaining Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults were unwilling to stay in "Hotel Mama" for the flaute on the apartment market.
In the large cities, the number of square meters per head has fallen again in recent years.
To solve the problem, the alliance "Social housing building" proposes a restart.
New incentives are intended to encourage social housing.
Thus, the basic acquisition tax could be waived and the basic tax on funded dwellings could be suspended temporarily.
In addition, according to alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The support programme for refugee accommodation of the State Bank of KfW is already good for cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start was already received on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available €300 million.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no perishing, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces that he should give the transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Inner Minister, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Inner Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
Hundreds of refugees have been broken up to Croatia after the deviation of the Serbian-Hungary border to reach western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television broadcaster RTL.
In the past, Hungary had ceased its limit for refugees.
New laws which entered into force on the same day make the ordinary asylum procedure in Hungary practically excessive.
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police had attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU-Nachbarland Croatia.
According to most media reports from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both with the bus and taxes to the Serbian border city Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not run on border zones.
There are other dangers in the border strips: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mining spacers are now aimed at creating a safe passage quickly.
However, after closing the border, there are little more refugees in Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people captured.
It was still 9380 on Monday shortly before the gateway.
The new Hungarian laws considered the overcoming and damage of the borderstone as a criminal offence.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern border town of Szeged.
The condemned threatens penalties for up to five years and the departure from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transitzones" in the border, almost all - 93 - the most important transition in Russia.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have stayed there.
However, no one has a practical prospect of asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum applicants are to be disposed of there.
A few hundred refugees were gathered before the "transit zone" in Russia.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up this.
They collected the waste that tens of thousands of people had left at the street edge in the past few weeks.
Locking grids were removed and one of the reception warehouses in the border area was rebuilt.
For the purpose of this transformation, no one wanted to express himself.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, about the 200,000 migrants still stayed in the country according to government statements.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the direction of German authorities.
In Freilasing, smaller groups of refugees regularly encountered walking.
Citizen's champion went "Strand" across the border
"We were busy cleaning after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were standing with travel bags at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to go to Passau with the train.
Because Germany had surprisingly set up railway traffic with Austria on Sunday, for them was the end of Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the beached with two other helpers and their cars over the border to the near Passau.
In the past, we have explored the unforeseen guests with jause and drinks.
We just said we're bringing them to Passau with the car.
"This was of course for us," said Stadler in the OØN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not take it to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the firearm.
"That has been very happy for us," says Stadler.
On Sunday evening in Wels, the beached train passengers went from an ICE to a regional route towards Passau to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that the railway transport was suspended to Germany.
The regional train was taken before the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival connected to the Bayerian neighbors on Sunday, day before a two bridge race sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends thousands more to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the camp of Röszke immediately in the establishment of structures to ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has pushed the Hungarian government's attitude into the dunst circuit of national socialism.
The sufferers of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "faithful land", which they invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create a human condition for protective seekers in view of the persistent refugee flows and the nearing winter.
And it will be an even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad searching for 35,000 winter festivals
Conrad has to do with the refugee destruction all hands full.
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording centre of Traiskirchen has already got into control with Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported his first success.
The accommodation of the 200,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was also done without a big whirlwind, Konrad said and praised the organizational "meester performance".
On the other hand, the Ministry of Interior spoke of a "crisisful situation".
Totally, Konrad calculates a requirement of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the number, 35.000 accommodations must be found in the next weeks - 20 000 are intended to provide the countries, 15 000 of the covenant.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a fashion without the ground," Konrad said.
He has already spoken with the heads of the country.
These would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's good," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Man Datar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to be explained how the church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF action "Helping Like Us".
On the platform, individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
You also hope for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Conrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In emergency times, it may not be possible that quarter donors must comply with a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
"Note standards" should apply for a period of time.
Conrad's experience is justified by the fact that he is more successful than the Ministry of the Interior.
I am an elderly lord, which isn't to say in the face the in truth.
Conviction power is his most important weapon.
Conrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs as they declared themselves.
Their employees want to increase them to three to four.
Your own career search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephans Square as a office.
However, there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
First, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for refugees is planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, since it can be done to the affected people without these measures at present, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further locations are to be checked on their virtue.
The Chief of the City exercises criticism in the division of refugees within the Federal Country.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Grenzes are not locked off"
In a longer telephone with Bayrian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), national chief Joseph Pühringer (VP) accorded on Monday the further approach in the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not locked down.
The further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there is now just the relevant border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist.
However, the protection seekers were brought to Germany with regular moves.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer demanded more solidarity in the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is re-introducing controls at its borders is a logical consequence for Pühringer from the course of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
Generalisation of the "New Werft" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the exchanged IT group S&T is to be hired to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T-Chef Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Werft and later also acquire some.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises: "The next runtastic is just a question of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Federation (FFG).
The building is paved by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented, for further 40 percent it asks.
Lia-Peroni holder opened second business in the Arcade
In the new shop Furla handbags are in the centre.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to put himself a dog.
This project had to postpone the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade in a short time: finally, she has now gained growth in the form of another business area.
In the Furla shop versus the business in which they sell, among other things, bags, shoes and garments of different manufacturers, everything is now about women's handbags of the brand Furla, money exchanges are to have from €75.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop has been in operation.
Several weeks earlier, it was reconstructed.
"I have been wondering for a long time if I should open another shop," says Breit.
The decision was essential, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of a own location where only their pockets are sold.
"We are the only ones in the larger Linz that sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been laid wide from her mother into the weigh.
I am most prone when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why, when some woman looks at a beautiful pocket in adornment, the specialist woman cannot answer with the last security.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag of each outfit is evaluating.
The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt
The ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This property also connects some to the billionary who wants to become President of the US.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exciting.
Whether he expresses himself opposed to foreign enemy, addressing journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US President's office strongly triggers the electoral struggle.
And cut off well.
This is also registered in the Palestinian Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate millionary are.
The New Yorker with the hairfrisur is a term for many in the Winzer village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200 inhabitants' place are over -twenty corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in election mode.
Simone Wendel, the calling townster, turned a film about trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the mightyest man in the world?
"I think they find this somewhat exciting, but are not very impressed in their cold city species," says Simone Wendel.
The borne cold cityater has turned a fun documentary film on the place and its famous sprays, among which the Ketchup family Heinz is also included next to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the king of the hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tendency to believe that Trump is "a bit a big mouth," says Wendel.
Randomly, the nickname that the Kallstadt has in the circumcision, "The Brulljesmaker" - to Hochdeutsch: the Angeber, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the Angeber.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold graves in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first real estate purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of Tragic: their desire to return to the home forever failed to the Bavarian State, to which the Pfalz then belonged.
He didn't take up Trump because he was once lost without permission, the director of the Institute of Pestician History and Public Science, Roland Paul, had explained to the start of the film.
Trump is the grandson of a "unfaithful immigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken absurdly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to shock illegal immigrants.
"As the polter, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote relative trumps ("The grandma was a born trump, the grandfather was born of Heinz").
The winner in retirement sees the American more distanzed, "he's always so exciting."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt."
The pensionist Veronika Schramm mentioned as some Kallstadter that a descendant of the Heinz family spent something for a visit, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It's better if he doesn't win the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if it's good."
If those who had the story in the U.S. at the time of his grandfather would have been like he, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than he," says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My president isn't," she says.
And, "The grapes will be mature without the President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinema gangers, even in the United States, the interest is raised.
The oberbayerian municipality Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President at the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the National Park Berchtesgaden received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "Bergsteigerdorns" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for the award of the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protection area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are going to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the liberals, but there have not been major shifts in the reviews for today.
The breakfast show of Nine was exhibited by the Federal Capital City when Malcolm Turnbull created the crash of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the Moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed not to be a matter for Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 viewers in the five main cities, compared to today 339,000.
Today, a slight increase compared to the rates for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
Today at average reached 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise in August.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40 000 and 50 000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers at today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morningmen more than the Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the review!

The great news for seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star from Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently known father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and smote the Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30 p.m.) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, showed an average of 446.000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 p.m. to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires hot seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half an hour of The Chase Australia reached 520.000 viewers, and in the second half an hour, 720.000 were set.
Warm seat average 60,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will be nine convinced that hot seat will eventually survive at 17:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that couldn't overwhelve the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have uncertainly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, where Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor, was filled in the biggest secret.
And none of the three girls left will certainly not give up if she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before three becomes, you may have given an accidental indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips firmly sealed to the final on Thursday
All three women have left out lyrics about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as a reason for their desire to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If you don't, who should receive Wood's last rose?", their answers could be to the game destructor who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both called Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went to the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energy, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it makes so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw her together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple.
From their viewpoint, Mackay said that the visit made her clear last week that Wood could be "the One".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreserved to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not she, she was ridiculous.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a disagreement between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is radiated on Ten on Wednesday 19:30.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his transfer to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open day of training late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a warrior as it did the Aussie-Rugby-Liga convertit at his first point return on Tuesday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a point return and also to the running game after an injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his smokes before the rest of the team through the mills, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49er sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who urged him to forget his past catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point restored in the first play district by the Minnesota Vikings
It certainly was not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the playground after the Fumble fluking and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he couldn't imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you're just taking care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the cutter with his Origin Debuut in 2007 when a passport in his own in-Goal area led to a trial for Queensland.
Yet, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne positioned for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of dizziness

After he had challenged President Vladimir Putin openly, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company conquered Yukos and undermined his democratic efforts.
The free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bayern because of the high refugee rates.
Head of the Party and Group of Humbert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Autumn Clause in Grandwall City against a severe crisis in Bayern's schools when there are no new teachers according to the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools from the collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Once we will get rejections in the Bayerian education system."
The country-day fraction of the free voters will be held in the subfrench municipality until Friday.
In fact, quite other main themes were intended.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free electoral meetings.
"Of course, the subject of asylum will overcome the clause," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s.
"This is not how it goes, we need the causes," said the Free Choice Chairman.
Rejected asylum applicants want to postpone the free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also asked more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW-Chef criticized the fact that several federal countries were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the Federal States in all lands."
"Bayers are moving off, others don't."
"Then we need to be more handlingable."
But the country's policy in the city of Great Wall is not to fall under the table.
A year of permanent burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 gymnasia started the pilot trial "Medium Grade Plus", which tested the extension of the gymnasial middle level from three to four years - then it will take nine years to the abitur.
But Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The topic G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW-Chef.
We demand freedom of choice for all the high schools who want to do so.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after cops shoot rubber shots on demonstrations in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal, after the police shot rubber shot into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Head of District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they attacked rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber shoes, which are known to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative, evidently produced such a high rate of death.
The debate was the last violent protests in weeks in the southern levels of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces, which are formed in the context of the proposed new constitution, would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want a own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflicts since 10.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake, which killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Building area planned in the city
The property at Emder Youth Center Old Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metres.

Emden - The city of Emden wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct neighborhood to the Youth Center of Old Post.
The preparations for this are currently in progress.
It is planned to use the area for a mixture of trade, industry and living.
You're waiting for the corresponding offers, it's from the city.
What an investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts had yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had bought a part of the property that is located on the Ringstraße/Corner Large Road a few months ago and had the building thereon.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for holiday homes at the small sea near Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Some concerns are further - they fear the sale of their recreational refugee
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, ruined, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday house settlement on the small sea near Emden are on the table.
The stakeholder, the medium-sized Emder Company "System-Bau", presented his plans for the first time publicly on Monday evening in the Emder Council City Development Committee.
This point had originally been held on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP fraction, which prevocated the investor and the management of secrets, Ralf Behrends went from the system-buy business management to the public: "We have not yet a answer to all questions," he said to the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The project of around 10 to 12 million euros has been discussed for months.
Heavy reactions among seabred owners, who had come to the meeting, proclaimed the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, seafarers' owner and board member, complains in the representation of the applicants, Pro Hieve, "It is a giant block that overheards all the other buildings."
In addition, he fears as many other project critics that the traffic would increase significantly by the intended size of the installation: "There must be whole bus charges in order to calculate," says Schulz
What happens exactly on the well a hectare large area of the former guesthouse, however, is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we have to have a clear concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Zwillings follow-ups at Gorillas in the Frankfurter Zoo
The Frankfurter Zoo is pleased with his gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought to life twins yesterday.
Divine births are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is nearly 50 years behind and had also been in Frankfurt in 1967, says the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not established yet, since Mother Dian has kept her close to the body so far.
First, the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center foretold a wide deep printing system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southest Cape Verde islands, which has a 60-percent chance to develop into a tropical turbulence in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined depth pressure system, such as in the middle of the Cape Verde and the small Antilles, also has a 60-percent potential to form a tropical turbulence in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign to bring 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations, as they escape from war crushed and poor countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach when announced the donation call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager announce it, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"On our journey, many dark train and bus trips, also hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family desperately seek help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugee lief are doubled to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has disappeared more than 4 million people this year.
Many flee from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which was destroyed by war.

For mildly overweight diabetes patients, weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight humans with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether mildly overweighted people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-urgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide article on the new study in JAMA surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to eat.
Over the years, Adipositas operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven efficient, but most studies have been performed in people who are illly fatty with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BMI over 30 are considered to be fatty.
Here you can calculate your BMI: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 compared two types of adipositas chirurgy - stomach bypass and stomach slurry - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweighted.
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, the BMI remained approximately the same in those receiving non-urgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those undergoing surgical intervention, the diabetes disease was fully solved in 36% and in part 28%.
In the medical-treated group, in comparison with diabetes, only one percent and partly only about two percent dissolved completely.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the ' surgical' group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, reflecting the blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from approximately 9 percent to approximately 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycamic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass Chirurgie group had lost more weight compared to the Gastrektomie group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved major decreases in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and more a complete surplus of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are evidence from a study of more severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was approximately 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any advantage for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said that it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think, as soon as they have collected these genetic changes that have solidly linked their bodies with fatigue and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in Hunsback
It is a topic that is currently increasingly noticed in Belletrism: A young woman, at school times unloved and invisible, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and he loves her.
Even in the recent novel "We are not really like that" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the history of love, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because he plays in boring and surrounding villages.
The chief occupational author grew up in boring and is happy that she could set a literary monument to her home.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not absorb all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the persistent refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the given circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admired, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and showed that the violent reaction of the United States was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my compassion in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in violencelessness.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the intake of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centres in the United States report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow strong alcoholic hand infections, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of intakes of hand disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centres increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Kids get to these products more and more frequently, and unfortunately, a percentage of them goes in the emergency," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants, while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a sample of discouragement in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Youths claim to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water in order to obtain a harder drink.
Less children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with earthberry, grape and orange fragrance that are very attractive to children.
Hand infection agents contain between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol somewhere.
Especially in young children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Gift Notruf Center at the University of Kansas, the Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let swallow whisky around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in the range of children, and if children come into it, it's a quick way to consume much alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four injections of odouring hand disinfectants in school, was taken into an emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which is legally considered to be drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency physician who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency.
Doctors overnight monitored them in a separate child hospital on signs of brain dreams, as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had shot her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very annoying," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfection ducks and to store hand infections outside the range of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Workers of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a fatal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which has been recorded as an active substance.
In January, three pupils of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison her "common" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the educational room," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to the contamination of the hands and has banned her from her room.
The police viewed the corrupt plan as "switching" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Frequency fluctuations: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been slightly injured in the case of an accident on the crossing between the Nordring and On Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-span to the circuit industry area and noticed too late that two pre-run vehicles had stopped during the circuit.
Afterwards, he robbed with his truck into the back of an Audi and pushed this vehicle on a front ford Fiesta.
In the case of accident-related vehicles, the police shall notify about EUR 10 000 injuries.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be pulled off.
No disharmony with Celtic
Griffiths plays the speech of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn this again.
Hearts will fight SFA for Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be careful at January's new obligations which could destroy the unity of the border
Dons increase guide over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooneys Elf meters in the first half gave Aberdeen a little victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the dons create a five-point slot between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talk about disharmony
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths. This claimed that he and his teammates were not under increased control because they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in the Scottish football is boring Netherlands - de Boer
The former Rangers Mediterranean player and the former national player in the Netherlands Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title ability with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said, "In the Netherlands they no longer show the highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the Old Company.
They talk about both teams together and that's what she cares about.
There is a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, I swear Deila.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent excretion from the Champions League, the defeat was followed against 10-man from Aberdeen, who now stand clear at the top of the table with five points of advance.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel it just like that - but we have to go on.
We really need, really the support of Celtic, because that makes players better.
It's so important to stand together now.
Warburton carefully at January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, indicating that he was filling some January transfers, Rangers Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new accesses and persists that he does not want to disturb the unit of the Ibrox-caders.
The Ex-Chef of Brentford said, "The January-Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players that come in summer have this presaison time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The crew is really good.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea Storm Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, indicated that he could withdraw if his contract runs out of the Swans.
For two years, the 29-year-old has been plaguing with a disgusting knee and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set on SFA battle because of Neilson's comments
The hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent out of the field and then lost 3:2, but the red map of the defendant was later lifted - the third red map of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains with what he said, and persists: "I haven't questioned integrity, I have not commented on any performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The infinite Hibee was corrected after he admitted to sing a song with insane texts about Ex-Hearts Player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a kneipe in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the storm and added, "It's sure I don't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly persists that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but confesses that the decline must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll bring the boys back to trab," said Donnelly.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh successive League victory that brought them a front of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There's no team who won everything, in pokal games or ligs, who didn't even win games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it increases in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in May to July at 164 000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10.000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was higher than that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
Over the quarter, the employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The state secretary of Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment.
Beverages disturbed
Since the security staff could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray, the officials were able to arrest the disturbers.
An atemalcohol test occurred in a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The growing one was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and was first maintained.
Why I will be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except in the event of a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope that it doesn't happen, I'll sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringes.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was already made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day went closer, I began to fear myself.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and as more applications are often available than places, a macable lottery takes place to decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to 5.
Whoever is selected, he will observe it emotionally.
I can't do that.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with which I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephones and a two and a half hours visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a Witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my inpartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I complain with her.
She admitted that she could have "it was better to formulate," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he'd do it.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all details here.
I can't sure say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would guilty him to be a beneficiaries of the deed.
But I think there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can call for.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessarily.
Man after moist police persecution hunting persecuted to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he convinced the man of the Canning River.
An attempt of a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the sailing and damping water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "overreach him softly to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale were called on Tuesday for a house peace breaking incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, he tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
"He stood in the water and said "I don't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactics - "A good policeman negotiated."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Mastership football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the graves to avoid an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy him out and threatens to end race sports
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stands last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a Rennday Treatment, the last Strohhalm on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for race sports and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it was the positive cobalt tobacco sample in Lidaris that he cannot explain.
He had retired 18 months because of the spionage punishment and didn't want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I was planning not to say anything about it, and I've been sitting long on it, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you respond, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around raised heads, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable.
"Eightteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - which I will name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my places to provide information about what I do within my stand," said Moody on Racing.com.
You seem to believe I'm a deceiver.
If that is the case, they should certainly get on their nose because they failed in trying to get me.
Robert Roulston, ehem. Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, official president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of the RVL, was aware of this at the time and are it still today.
Should this make me feel that it will be personal?
Has the RVL behaved thoroughly and maybe people outside trainers are responsible for what's going on in the industry?
I'm bad for the industry?
I'm so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and dismiss me, and I have no doubt that what I say let them think about it now.
But I have arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will exercise the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of the trainer have built up with the long-standing cobalt examination at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led him to say that he could "cast his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unmoorded Master Black Caviar, called the race-day treatment rule "small" after a pack of mud or sound had been placed on the horse's legs, which was violated by the rules.
"It is against the rules of race sport.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has wrongly obstructed mud on the leg.
It could've been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday.
But it was like that on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the packing on the race day. An examination of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you went too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after driver flight
In the weekend, the police arrested a man after a crash with a bicycler and then a driver flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was introduced with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia at the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of a driver's refugee and of a lack of assistance and of other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy fights against rivals for claims to ring fights
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy called criticism for the tackling of his players as "Agenda setting" by two Prime League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster Trainer Trent Robinson said that the arbitrators allowed the storm players "ring fighting" with his team during the high storm victory at the Qualifying Finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly sheltered comment on the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "Musterexample" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "for good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the thanksgiving of his team and said they were focused only on their "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team was confident to vote him, as it meant that they were worried about being struck by the storm team.
"That appears again and again - I haven't heard that Trent Robinson talked about ring fights when they hit us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing on our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year. But in the last six weeks, we have made our contact with Thankles a real focus, and that has resulted in the trend change for us.
Trent has now been there for three years, and he has obviously a great team to train. Therefore, he is probably not used to lose, so it was a bit a shock for him.
It's already funny how this appears again and again at this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of the "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "smart" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we view as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all of his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried to have to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't viewed it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks making and no points exciting?
For me, it's the plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in a phase.
The Storm team was free this weekend, since they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on Saturday night in the AAMI Park. The ticket sales starts on Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200.000 deposit by drug charge
A man who possibly threatens a lifelong penalty because of his attempt to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled to Queensland was released against a deposit of $200.000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Solay, which came over Vanuatu from South America and built in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his fellows in the hunting port during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially lifelong penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that it could have been for a harmless reason in the café.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relationships with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his place of stay.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a deposit of $200.000 as a security jointly to reach his release.
"After reading the ointmental statements of the two persons, it is clear that the settlement of a security of $200.000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But this alone will not be enough to prevent him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against guution, under the conditions that he leaves his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police daily and holds on an outcoming block of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Chairhouse breaks apart
In the event of an accident with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked to Basel before a permanent building point.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to wake out the last moment to the left, as the police told.
The cab of the accident causer is completely distinguished.
The driver was severely injured to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was fully locked over six hours to 2 p.m.
A damage amounted to EUR 122,000.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to attract pedophile to send pictures
A pedophiler used the phone of a 11 - year - old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this was sleeping, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of inappropriate pictures of children sent by another user.
The girl later wake up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police cared for it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "Pedophile on the Internet" and then "defined to be a cop to scare them."
The state lawyer Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court: "he said it would be a addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said that it had happened because he claimed to be a cop to scare pedophile.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to attract them.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the crying and crying.
She then also saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the charged computer and play station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the accusation to have taken inappropriate pictures of children on 14 June last year, to have breached the orders on 25 January of this year and not appeared to have been heard before court on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual criminals, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his infringement.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael dismissed the judgment until October to obtain background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted guarantee, but for consultations with other outstanding cases was held in investigation.
He was incorporated into the list of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.
Schleuser wears on small border transitions to Germany
More and more refugees will be arrested on the side of the major control points at the German-Austria border.
Many lockers made people grow on smaller border crossings in fear of discovery and arrest
On the Austrian side, a speaker of the Federal Police said.
Along the border flow of Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been arrested in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They were walking over bridges and stewhre on the German side.
There they are received by federal policemen and forwarded to registration.
On the Münchner main station, more refugees came back after federal police statements compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
At 8:00 a.m., some 700 people arrived in the capital of the country, said a speaker in the morning.
After re-introduction of controls at the German-Austria border, refugees reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Expected runner of Tropenstorm "Henry" in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a deep-pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air flows into the country, the German weather service (DWD) in Stuttgart reported.
The strong depth is the runner of the "Henry" tropical storm, which in the past days moved across the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands.
Heavy storms and weather are expected mainly in baths.
According to DWD, until Thursday, the black forest, the Swabian alb and the soil sea circuit are counted with bows from 60 to 90 kilometres.
Thus, on Friday, the sun can be looked again longer.
The mass makes it: every two years the car builders show their news on the IAA.
In 2015, there is especially movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling very well.
Cars from the compact class are currently specially asked: around 28.1 per cent of the new permits were found on this segment in August alone, according to the Motor Force Alliance (KBA).
This is also reflected on the IAA (Publicum Days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futurist concept vehicles and new superclass and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the largest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, who will be with the dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chef Karl-Thomas Neumann on the fair.
He's part of the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new Astra is not supposed to be much more expensive.
Opel offers a rise below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at EUR 17.650.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1,4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the hessens offer further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW//200 PS, including three-cylinder benzines for the first time.
Unlike the most important competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only a five-store.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the Combi, which can also be seen on the IAA.
And what's going on on new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane to race.
On the fair the Mégane is only seen as a fifth door in a conventional and stressed sporting GT version.
He comes into trade at the beginning of next year, then as a combi.
Infiniti: Infiniti Q30 is new in the segment.
The Nissan delegate wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its twisted lines fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
In the offer, however, is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to the manufacturer’s data.
The sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën delegate were especially handed on the front side: Here the refrigerator grill was reared and the changed lights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernised, reduced the number of buttons by a touchscreen and integrated Apples CarPlay for the first time.
In addition, on the IAA in the compact class a series of reviews and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Bagle: Five square meters of cell is human invaluable
The Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to an ex-catcher of the judicial court, which has been placed in a small cell for months.
Because of the injury of their human dignity, prisoners are principally entitled to financial compensation if they are placed in small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, even if they were locked up in the rooms to be too close, they can hope for money. (Act.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This was the success of an ex-catcher with his constitutional constitutional difficulties in Karlsruhe: he was placed in a single cell with about five square metres of ground surface in the Berlin-Berlin-Bel-Bail court, between June and November 2009; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Afterwards, the man who, according to his lawyer’s statement, has been moved to a larger cell.
Although his official arrest complaint was incurred because of the unworthy prison conditions against the country of Berlin.
However, the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination there.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
The Chamber's Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Although for legal reasons, for the period concerned, only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were essential, a claim was given, it said.
Otherwise it would be "true to fear the legal protection of personality".
The Chamber Court has now to set up the amount of money compensation.
In the past, the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
Thus, in April, they only spoke to a prisoner because he was naked in a cell.
Humanly invaluable is, according to a decision of 2011, also the multiple layout of a cell without separate toilets.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday the Constitutional Court of Berlin, which in a parallel case in November 2009 certified a human invaluation.
The case of Karlsruhe was the same in a cell between 15 and 21 hours every day, over three months.
In recent weeks, the Berlin prisons have also arrived in the headlines because of lack of staff.
Consequently, prisoners are repeatedly included in 23 hours, which increases aggressivity, and even beatings are expected to have come because of the stressed situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 places in bricks are not occupied because of a growing shortage, 19 are supposed to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
Some 800,000 asylum applicants will come to Germany this year according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of Industry, according to Vizekanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is even able to take up a million refugees.
The Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated decisiveness in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create this, and we can do it."
What happens to Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost double as much as is built so far (250000 apartments).
Dramaticly, however, the lack of living space is mainly in payable rentals: Annually 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond, and for these particularly favourable apartments refugees will also apply for.
Therefore, Federal Minister for Construction, Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from currently 518 million to a billion euros.
A lot too little is that from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing should be created annually and the Federal Council should invest a total of 6.4 billion per year for this purpose.
Scientists and Federal Ministry of Construction agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
As estimated by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55% of the refugees in Germany may be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation criticises.
However, for the integration of refugees, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the admission society, but also for the self-consciousness of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn: the ban on the work of refugees to recognise work.
While there was a work ban for asylum applicants from up to five years earlier, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the duty of residence that asylum applicants restrict to a place of residence.
In society, also because of the lack of professionals, the majority have expressed the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is lack of German knowledge.
Until now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most frequently communicated by personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, the construction of networks is therefore the royal route to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fledged parents give their children into the kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the developed parents it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes handsheets in different languages.
If the need for education increases significantly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity, for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge in welcome classes will be prepared for education.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a second-language qualification in German.
There is no lack in them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no state of asylum candidates or patiences prohibit the study - the only exception was until Berlin, the interior agent Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Student refugees could facilitate access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or tolerance are no longer provided for under the Asylum Application Service Act when they start a study.
In principle, the latter do not receive a bunker because they do not fall under the circle of the occupied persons.
Durable refugees must have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to Bafög from 1 January 2016 to shorten this span to 15 months.
However, this financing gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Work.
Students should immediately get Bafög.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, for many refugees are Muslims, and for many is religion a key part of their identity.
The State should give Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State Church law to a new state-religion ratio.
It would also be important to establish a Islamic welfare association that is professionally concerned with the newcomers.
Rights include obligations.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and give it certain control options.
This includes the willingness to act against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be recorded to Germany.
Those who wanted to expose such conflicts in Germany, "has immediately their right to live here, confused in Germany," he said in the Bayrian broadcast.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
Integration will be much more than today a topic of all society.
This will also need to change the majority society, the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, been an anti-discriminatory body and a general equality law for a few decades.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the stakeholders demand for non-white Germans for a long time and for which international agreements like the Anti-rassism Convention of Germany are required must be realised in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and uses its new citizens - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees that are expected so far, according to physician president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As for man power and capacity, we can do this," he said to the day level.
However, additional money must be flown into the system for this purpose.
In order to avoid breast-feeding, Montgomery calls for all commendants to deliver health cards at the time of registration.
The benefits provided could be charged with the federal countries later.
And it is very questionable for the long term to eat so many people with the limited directory of performance provided for by the asylum application law.
Otherwise, doctors are creating the language barriers.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven, migrants are less informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, it needs to be taken into account interpreters' costs.
However, many refugees would be helped with more general medical addresses in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
In refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and in young people it is about HIV information.
With the partially other pictures of disease, German doctors came from their training, however, says Montgomery.
"Parasite seizures or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as to the doctor's theme, the refugees may even be in view of relief.
The Syrians had a high-developed educational system, some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practise, they would have to demonstrate their qualification and possibly reject tests.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimated by the Federal Psychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorders or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee kids, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by TU Munich shows that each fifth Syrian refugee kid comes traumatically into Germany.
Those who are sick of a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, heart races and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong terribleness and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
To date, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees are given psychiatric therapy.
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can apply for psychiatric therapy, treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices most of the experts or doctors who are not trained for psychiatric diseases would decide whether treatment is necessary or not.
This often leads to failure assessments, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new scenario "Leathership" the Circus Probst resorts to the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to draw every age group into the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal sports and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Test invites to the manege on the bricks to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine without living my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.
"Leadership" - under this motto is the current manoeuvrance.
For over 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Test.
So the gift to enthusiasm is in the blood of the family.
"We are important to get people away from their everyday assault and take them into a completely different world for two hours," stresses the 27-year-old junior director.
"Manegencocktail with World City Fleir", then director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3000 kilometres long tour are now able to experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with joke and charm in its ban.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the stupid films, it wants to take the Cuban duo easyer.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the Mast is intended to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Besides many salmon salmons, the acrobatic of the Circus Probst also fascinates with the feeling and joint.
Balance with the single wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snakes fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," stresses Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mismatch in the attitude of crustaceans is only too often the subject of various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Provst also takes the position: "If our animals are not good, we also are not good."
Approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroke unit.
The "four-foot artists", as they are called lovingly, will be read from the eyes, if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to go into the manege.
So the top commandment: care well for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture from a Shetland Ponyhengst and a Zebrastute, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have lived together eight years in a walk and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but for that it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So for every visitor, it's supposed to be something to do.
"One is sure," says Stephanie Test: "Whether five or 1,200 audiences, we always give our best and are there with all our hearts."
The Circus Probst invites to his ideas from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 a.m. on a daily basis.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 16 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the idea at 17 p.m. the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal view is open daily from 10 to 18 a.m.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe holds false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the staircase from the beginning of the year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media.
The opening of this Parliament was also deceived by the opposition's members' claims that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mugabe's speech with buh calls.
Last month, they had built him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of movement for democratic change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they warned against disturbing Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Dead'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and, as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "a concern" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and distinguish the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its service business activities.
The expected job degradation leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than it is HP today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will be concentrated on the provision of unequivocal, integrated technology solutions for businesses to date," says a statement by the company.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to create electrical installations and the Palo Alto Garage called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US-tech companies, is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide a better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Winger stressed against Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is planned, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England, and given his history, his participation in the European Championship is surely still uncertain in the next summer.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had completed the last season after a separate injury and then returned to his old turn during the pre-saison.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Winger.
It's a bone that didn't cure well.
That's not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his knocks or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a pure medical viewpoint, but as Winger also recognized, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd has reported 23 different diseases by Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five games.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight games since 2007/08 they were one of the two League Premier Clubs, who have reported most injury days.
Winger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a delicate period, a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain battle force," said Winger.
Jack's young enough to overcome it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will run through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Todtenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Winger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nao Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need to make a small break," said Winger.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to continue through Group F, the Maxsimir Stadion in Zagreb belongs to the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unfounded after 41 games after the "unfetchable" campaign was started in the last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by a earthquake, measured 3.2 on the judge scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Winger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League Capital against Monaco and remains driven by the remote hope to lead the association to its first Europepokal triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Winger.
It's never done with Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am in business long enough to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar presentations in shows is evident, especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves has become more desperate than ever before, as suicide among young men proved at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it remains three times more frequent among men than women.
In trying to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a disgraceful life) announced 2015 as the year of man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need them.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the fight to master this challenge.
A current study in more than 2,000 high school school school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "slight atmosphere" his chances for healing doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media communication, with their focus on style about substance, the immediateness of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong, life-saving and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our spiritual health far more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionary recently explained, money can't really buy happiness.
The beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which was shined by interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent arms, moments of football watching in cosy chairs and the desire from Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to it at any time, even if they often stop to explore their feelings completely.
As an employee of the telephony care explained to me, "my listening role for people who feel depressed and are threatened with suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old speech application "I come along with it" has a huge effect, such as the feeling that it is seen as weakness when speaking openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that come in mind when I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective external status through the phone can help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the totally newly designed couples of the day, why not take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass by to Malmö.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held courses when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Debuuts as a PSG player who brought the French master to the road, but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before finally increasing her procurement, when Cavani reached a headballtor in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they are not only pursuing the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities before the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his home city team and the association with which he started his illustrated career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. Therefore it's a good start to win 2:0 to cause our opponents problems and to look relaxed back, even if there are certain things we still need to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not reached one or two more gates."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which could hold a 2:2 disadvantage in his own place against Bordeaux in the first league, but he was extruded in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine Wingstorm was called the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United, and he indicated why when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense, before he passed to Johan Wiland beautifully into the long corner of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, the Celtic hit in a play-off to reach this stage, arrived at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But with the exception of a shot of Nikola Djurdjic, who was far on Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute pre-cover, they offered little attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up himself, with some mistakes and bad closures, not least by Ibrahimovic, who was patched in the first half at least five trials alone and then surrendered after Cavani had restarted it.
Yet, he proved much more skillful when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a turning shot, which was overturned by Wiland in the 52th minute on the feet ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayian reached its sixth seasonator after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was known a gate at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class about his team, and the Norweger said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish Liga, which does not have the same level.
Qualification games are not enough."
Go ahead of Paris!
It was a great game of them!

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World and Europe Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was evident a few years ago, just before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona at that time.
Eight times Spanish Master, three times Pocal winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer, the 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already before the EM in 2008 before the Barcelona termination.
"There was told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we didn't win," he says.
And that also recorded the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was a offer of Bayern."
"Rommigge wanted me."
To remember: In summer 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change
But the change did not happen.
And the key man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça took Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the crew without me."
"That's what he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's game time 2008/2009 would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the Champions League's quarterly finalal against the Bayers over the entire distance on the race, turned the reds off (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrated the Kingly class triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in film creation down
Matt Damon confronted the afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a result of Sunday Night of HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actress Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected playbook of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then do it when you occupy the movie and not when putting the show," insured Damon.
Brown reacted shocked, with innocent disbelieving and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay" when the comments of the actress of The Martian were attached.
Damon and Brown joined the producers' colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show financialists.
"I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony," said Brown first.
The only black person, and she is a nut beaten by her white holder.
The producer of Dear White People set up for the Finalists Leo Angelos and Christian Brancaccio for the rulership rights in the film; Damon replied that their government could "in the end give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was launched, the social media exploded before disappointment about Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 Retweets and 4,000 Likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racism representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved a country-wide effect and urged lawyers and authorities to offer discriminatory practices against colorful stopping.
In February, the singer Prince made a play on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (Albums still have their significance) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their significance.
In recent times, leaders of the movement of Black Lives Matter have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News Personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The network Black Lives Matter is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Profi sports climbers and service aid Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete that won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big price of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just completed its seventh season, had never experienced a competitor who could complete all stages of his barrier park.
During the season, two men, Caldiero and Cameraman Geoff Britten, were created to the final.
The last task was to climb on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
British completed the task within the time with which he was the first athlete who completed the effortful phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero completed this challenge three seconds faster, making it a victory.
Caldiero spoke to E! messages after the hard fighting victory, still under the shock about the gain of the big price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about that I've never earned more than $10.000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his lot of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why British, although he first ended the parcours at all, did not receive any price money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much the money is a wonderful price and the life changes, it gets the great greeting.
I don't think he's having any wrath about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be struck by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the rolls.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth stake, the turning work will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers pass to Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-- The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Earlier they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the tigers are at the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers were reduced to their role as a spoiler, but on Tuesday this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the target field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters of F-word that was so difficult to grab over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories make fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support upright, when Detroit three times in the first two innings points, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit six times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to finish this year strongly," said Simon.
It is difficult to throw every game into the Bullpen, and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's swing the timber well," said Ausmus.
He looked well out at the (slagtraining), looked clearly better in the Bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs in the back meeting at the end of the seventh innings, the twins had their best chance to get back to the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunch, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before he was replaced by the left hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Mauer, the only man with whom he was confronted, before the designated smoker Miguel Sano, who entriss a two-run to the right hand Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of louds and the final run at the second, the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe brought to a double play.
It was the major League 27 times in this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth Innings, the wall created a RBI double against the closer of the Tiger Bruce Rondon and reached the stand of 5-4.
The right hand, however, stuck Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a Phil Hughes that was not yet moving.
The Tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right hand feteran, which had been removed from the injury list before the game after he had missed more than a month of backing.
"Certainly not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After they first received the Leadoff Battery, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the Scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with one single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, a one-out double from Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from the Center-Filder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big hit," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he took the right place.
Hughes was located in a Pitch count, did not achieve any points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reliever legal hand A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Notes: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez dismissed because of the injury of the choppers.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list because of a shoulder crushed, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is deleted from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July
He has been missing since August 20 because of a destruction in the right hip.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are supposed to be in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who are in this area will then be placed in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the town Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She calculated with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital have been prepared for this case in the past days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily seized there.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
Only in the past ten days, according to the government presidency responsible for the first take-up, Gießen had arrived 7500 people in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria
The leader of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria as an opportunity.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options should not take place without Germany," he said.
He foretold the European states "collective ways".
Four years ago, it was glad that the cherry had passed military participation in Germany.
"Now the conflict is landing in front of our door," he said in Germany's radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase in international assistance on site for refugees.
Austria controls at the southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian interior minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV broadcaster ORF, no one is now being sent back to Hungary.
Germany has also not sent refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
Michl-Leitner said that there have already been discussions on this matter between the Director-General for Public Security and the representatives of Germany, as regards an agreement which would allow Germany to take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day.
She did not call concrete figures and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria over the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Canzler Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other Heads of State and Government, asked for a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU Member States have not yet been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
The EU Ministers for Foreign Affairs want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of additional 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on the coming Tuesday (22 September).
In view of the strong refugee trend in Germany, the covenant wants to strengthen the support of the countries in the first take-up and distribution of people.
The covenant will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussion with the Ministers of the Canciliate Office in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those who need protection also receive this.
However, those who have no prospects of stay can not stay in Germany either.
This opinion was definitely divided into the round.
The mayor stressed that the State as a whole now has to deal with a "great force effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
In the night of Tuesday, Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia.
A few hours thereafter, the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania should also be locked down with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU, different from Serbia.
Hungary wanted to prevent Schlepper from seeking outlet routes over Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto about the planned new border zone.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, there were thousands of migrants who were on their way to the Greek border, according to eyewitness reports.
Spacesonde "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icespaner of the Saturnmond Enceladus, a global ocean swallows.
Close researchers from observations of the space zone "Cassini".
Therefore, the moon sways slightly on its track around the ring planet.
This dive movement is only small, but still too large for a continuously solid heaven body, says in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the Icarus section.
Once longer, it was known that there must be liquid water under the iceladus ceiling.
Thus, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the South Pole of the Saturn Moon, spearing water vapour and ice partikels and thus feeding the so-called e-ring of the Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be a underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must leave about a month of open-label Valdet Rama.
A study has resulted in an injury in the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Lions, the diagnosis means "foreseen four weeks of compulsory break".
"That hits us hard, Rama is a heroic loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Image" journal with a view to the possible commitment of a ununited professional.
However, as a training guest, the sixty first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the possibility to prove his ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to crew training next week after his brain shaking.
Even on Thursday, the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the course training.
Okotie had been hurt in the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a severe collision of the head.
In contrast to the first fears, however, he remained without a serious bless.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain lots of sugar
Mangos are exotic and safty-sweet.
But whosoever wants to pay attention to his slank line, it is often more advised by them.
Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: B-vitamins and the E and C vitamins are put in them. Above all, mangos contain much vitamin A and its pre-level beta-carotine.
Whoever eats the fruits, thus supports vision, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone doesn't matter how mature the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
You should be stored at room temperature and consumed within few days.
Of course, they taste pure or sweet food.
But a mango also gives heartfelt courts a special note.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salates such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well for fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The UPS US package service will restore up to 95000 aids for Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are searched for.
As early as last year, UPS had increased his staff for the holiday season by 95000 aids.
In view of the thriving online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have made precautions for the last year to be armed for Christmas business.
In 2013 late deliverys had brought harsh criticism to the package services.
First fencestorm, then marked cold front
In the next night, the valleys of the northern side of the feet break through, as Meteoswitzerland announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the feet blows partially with storm strength through the feet valleys.
After the spring on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, which brings strong rainfall, windbows and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep-pressure area across the British islands in a strong southwest stream.
On the northern side of the Alps breaks in the night to the Wednesday of the feet through the valleys.
As a result, the feet blows to Thursday morning in the feet valleys with bows from 60 to 100 km/h, individually and in particular in the Urnerland, partly with more than 100 km/h.
The fountain can go to the neighbouring Mediterranean, and on the mountains even orcan bows of more than 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy feet provides summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, moisture begins to stew on the Alps southern slope.
Sets the rains to hold until Thursday night.
In sums, in the next 48 hours, the Alps have to be estimated to be partially over 100 litres of rain per square meter, which has fallen large rains in the last few days.
On Thursday morning the foon goes out of the air, then a cold front rolls over Switzerland with strong, partially violent rain from West to East.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go significantly down.
The following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be sunnyer and warmer in the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
Nearly 500 years after the reformation there is now a Martin Luther site in Rome.
In the presence of City President Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday a nameless place was baptized in the park on the Uppio hill on the name of the German reformator.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now dignified as "German Theologian of Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
On Wednesday, Jens-Martin Kruse, priest of the Evangelical-Lutherian municipality in Rome, reminded that the Protestants in the city of the popes often could live as a minority only in hiding their faith over centuries.
With this place, it will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustiner monk around the 1510/11 season in Rome a few months.
He then felt the city as a profound sinful babel.
His negative impressions, according to historians, might have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then launched the division of the evening church with his theses against the sales trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) dorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bibel, which has now appeared with beautiful pictures.
At the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motives formulated its entire personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "speak" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has received the 75-year-old - but that is no matter what is equal to "joying" images.
On the contrary, adapting the respective topics can be quite dark.
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective artistic selection of the many topics of the "book of all books".
Circles are designed to devote to themes such as crossways, plagues, commandments, or our fathers.
So he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publisher with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who has been dealing with the respective Bible verses on the basis of painting.
He interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into today, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Biblical quote of Martin Luther and each of the artists who express their entire personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry tape has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old equally allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and grew up in Berlin, come from a family who belonged to the stringent Protestant Mr. Huter-order.
"Then the education was already done with the pipestock," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I've tried to work that up, perhaps to deal with me again with the Lord Father."
His second concern is to help the art again to more value in a fast lifetime: "The perception of picture worlds is now characterized by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolics are disappeared there.
Artists have a different desire and beauty to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Old wants the viewers to "invade" the pictures, let them act on themselves, discover and feel the strength they have: "The picture is looking for his counter."
Klaus Altepost said on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "very always" to be a lover of Otmar Old Art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Old did not take full account of the Bible but chose the important and mysterious topics for him.
"It wasn't a collaboration at the height of the eyes," says Oldepost, "This is about the pictures that the text explains only." It was a picture-biblical.
For Hans Möhler from the Luther publisher, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Olds pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and the of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX train nearby
Plans made, found place, company ordered, ground hills modeled for a round course: One year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX train, it was ended again.
Policies and administration failures provided for disruption, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So hills disappeared, searching for new place - now with formal planning and request for construction authorisation.
The authorization will take place in October, the first municipal council Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to inform in the Child and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year still happens visible," she said.
It was then to begin with the work at the former hall bath without a "more memorial break".
DFB intensifies commitment for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Federal Liga presents a clear sign in the weekend.
The football reacts to the state of interest in Germany and ensures its help in tackling the upcoming problems.
"I believe this is the biggest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"Nobody can in principle say that it doesn't matter to me, I don't have anything to do with it."
"That must be interesting for everyone to handle this topic," said DFB-Chef Wolfgang Niersbach.
At an annual meeting with Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to intensely discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I am next Wednesday in the office of office and meet the Minister of State Ms. Özoğuz and the Chancellor there."
"There will certainly play a central role in the topic," he announced.
The football can and wants to help.
The decisive softness, however, has to set the politics.
The German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.
"About the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019," explained Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Federal Ligists also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals put a clear sign when they will bear the print "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left tricot tarm instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo.
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusens Sportschef Rudi Völler of the "Image" newspaper (service day) and called the project "self-understanding".
"The refugee droma's going on everybody, nobody can see away."
"We can football alliesligists, no, we have to use our radiation power, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hopfenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
On Friday, the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Sale to the EM-qualification game against Hungary.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large Community work of German football".
That all 36 license associations in their places had started their own projects are great.
Similarly, smaller and smallest associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" we have published is lived in football.
"This is of great importance," he said.
In this and the next year, the Association together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees each.
"The associations have already picked up the total for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: Head of SAP loses an eye in the event of accidents
The CEO of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost the left eye by a crash at the beginning of July.
In the case of the accident on the stairs of his brother's house in the United States, he would have fallen after midnight on a glass of water that he had carried in the left hand, reports the "economic week" on Wednesday.
"He was almost bleeded, was insane, then pulled himself out on the street - that he told us so last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could do his work.
"Begin of October we meet before the Supervisory Council meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager is at the meeting and "full of work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "South German newspaper" (Thursday edition) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software groups.
"I'm full of SAP there, full of my job."
"I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the SZ.
McDermott usually penetrates between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP Central in Walldorf.
It is important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, said the manager of the "SZ": "Everyone can happen like that."
"It's important to get up again when you're falling."
McLaren-Replacement pilot Magnussen except fighting ...
Magnussen twittered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he crashed from the wheel.
Thus, he comes as little as a spare driver during the night race in Singapore in the weekend for the two pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the great price of Japan.
Football: BVB without reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus were definitively destroyed in the first group game of the Europe League.
The national player will miss the table leader of the football bundesliga also in the duell with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00/Sky).
"Unfortunately we can't react to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga Topspiel gegen Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB Coach left open: "We expect a return from him to his training on Friday."
In view of the high burden of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribe on the reus position.
So he announced a change in the gatekeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of tribekeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weed folds will be used in all Europe League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
With a high probability, he will also defend the second party.
The research statement by fellow player Reus that the final input for the BVB in Europe League must be the goal, Mediterranean player Julian Weigl considers it to prove that "Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Roboterautos: Government wants a ride role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be, according to the will of the Federal Government, in changing the car of technological pre-residents.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday in Frankfurt, Dobrindt spoke of a "new mobility age" at the edge of the auto fair IAA.
The automated and networked driving will increase transport security and provide less steady state, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, which also meet with representatives of the industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport underlines, inter alia, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and the rapid transition to digital hearing radio.
For the purpose of testing new techniques, there is currently a test line on the motorway 9 in Bayern.
In order for the driver to be "no additional liability risks" the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
Thus, Germany aims to make an international effort to raise the permissible maximum speed for self-running cars from 10 to 130 hours km.
The Federal Government also wants to take action to amend the Vienna Convention, which is currently merely intended for people as drivers.
When automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds fast.
Following a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automatised driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, rideless vehicles on public roads are "awaitable only far after 2020".
The value added in the field of driving resistance systems and high-automatised driving functions at the site of Germany estimates the authors of the study for 2025 to approximately EUR 8.4 billion.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic," said the SPD traffic policy officer Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly explained.
However, the German automobiles still see susceptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey of the Forsa Institute, submitted on Wednesday on the AA, on behalf of the Dekra Test Organization, results in the fact that only eight percent of the Germans believe that automobile cars will survive in the next ten years, 32 percent expect this only in 20 years, 31 percent do not at all believe in it.
In France, 21 percent of the respondents are expected to drive automobiles by 2025, 33 percent in the United States.
Without prejudice, the drivers in Germany are not yet willing to rely fully on a self-running vehicle.
After a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to give control over all roads during the entire journey.
On the motorway, this could possibly represent 15 percent in flowing traffic, 45 percent in the stack.
Well, every four would not let the car control under any circumstances.
Ball stops team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants only to look out in a separate way at the title fights from 25 September to 4 October after its current stand.
The final decision shall be taken at the latest on 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys learned it in the morning."
"We are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Rosßkopf during the EM-Learning in Düsseldorf.
Ball was at that time on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsoring date in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected to be back on Friday.
"Without Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favorite," explained individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamlener, who is leading the setlist in Jekaterinburg, also reminded of the EM in Switzerland in 2013.
"Then Timo also missed, and we became European champion."
"We should focus on this," explained the world's organizers' fifths.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has attracted a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defendant was struck in a tackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis suggested that the 20-year-old partner of Bastian Schweinsteiger would break a rail leg.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion views and a waxfigure barbecue cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: Show window poppings that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creatures of the French designer, which, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and thus he put men in cracks.
"I can't say today that I'm the Enfant terrible of the skin Couture because I have white hair."
"From the time it was bleeded, in the meantime it's real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Citizensteig on the walking step), which is seen in the art hall of the Hypo-cultural Foundation, it is a happiness that the fashion creator has changed his initial rejecting attitude to a view of his person.
Actually he had been against it, for, "For me an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
When you die, you're going to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the art hall, Roger Diederen.
It is tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exponents give an insight into the hardly overlooking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork for which much effort has been carried out: To freeze the pops, for example, a stylist was committed.
14 tons of material, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot carted to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was another special snatch: a leather pants outfit with corsett.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, sightful fashionable walking attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he dressed his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He taught himself later to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
But later I bought them, of course.
For his first own mode view, he has not been able to pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze als Mode-Nische
Earlier it went into and around the long sticking machines for making meters.
The coated fabrics and peaks developed in a large amount for customers, for example, to cover and gardins.
This alone does not work anymore today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the fashion peaks.
Instead, the fashion is important again.
The fashion played a bigger role in the early times of the Plauener Spitze, then dispersed by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a nose.
Reinhardt calls some examples: peak in jewelry, accessories such as pockets and regional struggles.
Overall, the so-called vintage mode, which is based on past style pochs, represents an increasing potential for jobs.
Those who do not operate in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us they already make half of all orders.
Modespite Plauen is a member of the Branchenverband Plauener Spitze und Stickereien.
Only they may bear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of turnover has been devastated.
Private businesses and the wholesale are almost no longer available.
Our products are hardly reaching the customer in this way.
The massware is produced much cheaper in the Asian space today and is almost exclusively distributed via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and to the USA.
So sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point out by environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "We have led a quality seal since this year, which shows that we produce ecological and socially tolerable production."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplomdesigner Ute Schmidt teaches at the Snowberger Outside of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and is specialized in Stickery and Peaks.
In order to counteract the competition from the Asian area, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of designers and the companies that have to think mainly economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only easily varied to hold a customer's stame.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter renewed the historic snowball peak.
At some places, the machine sticks small chickens.
The Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Kruuße was inspired of it: "I couldn't start with a traditional plowshot."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an exhaustive procedure, it marks the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region are identifying themselves with the topic of punishment - young and old," Reuter says.
It also delivers to the USA, to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in defects and surroundings and who want a memorial piece.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plant new "Mary Poppins" movie
You don't want to touch legends, but Disney still dares to a new film from his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to Entertainment Weekly, it is not about a new filming, but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl.
It is about the experiences of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economy crisis in England.
Those who play Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews are still unclear.
But the director already stands firm: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the movie.
Xi urges to open the economy wider to the world
The economy needs to open itself widely outside to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group responsible for the management of the reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business founding strategies," he said in a talk at the 16th meeting of the Central Leader Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new foundations and promoting reforms will lead to new diversity and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The Leader Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list for the regulation of market access, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of State Enterprises (SEO), the inclusion of private capital, and the overcoming of the inhabitants' reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up which identifies sectors and companies which are not in question for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important, as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal state of business and makes the market more open, said the Statement.
The government will also facilitate controls of the powers conferred on the companies and ensure that companies decide how they carry out their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In the context of an offer to open publicly controlled sectors, further areas for private investment are opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign funded companies and provide better services for them," said the Statement.
In addition, it is made it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activity and to take up professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also participated in the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
The EU wants to double the mercury limit in robbery
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large robbery fish and thus give consumers a significantly higher dose of nervous toxicity.
The Foodwatch Consumer Organisation, which has a relevant EU workpaper, criticized the plans sharply: "Risks and adverse effects of failures in industrial and environmental policy are being forwarded with full attention to pregnancy and young children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt von Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of nervous toxicity for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or sword fish for "economic policy reasons" are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large robbery fish have been so severely burdensome with mercury today that on the basis of the still existing limits, about 50 percent of the catches should not be sold.
After doubleing the limits, only 14,5 percent would be incapable.
In return for this enlightenment, according to foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limits for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, called this "Trick", because smaller petfish, such as carps, are mostly so low that they already comply with the planned maximum levels.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfide distraction maneuver that helps the economy alone", explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a high-toxic heavy metal for humans, which reaches the food chain strongly, especially in robbery.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "prepared small amounts can cause especially in the event of unborn injuries of the nervous system".
The Federal Environment Ministry, however, explains on its website with regard to the applicable maximum levels that a "health threat of the general population" is not expected.
Mercury comes into the environment mainly by the incineration of coal.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power plants run out to Annalena Baerbock’s Green Federation Day Member, more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, such as in Elbe, Rhine and Donau, was "continuous and surface-wide", quoted the "speak" from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
