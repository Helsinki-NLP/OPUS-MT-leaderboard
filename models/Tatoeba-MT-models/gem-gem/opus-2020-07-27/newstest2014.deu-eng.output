Gutach: More security for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33-foot pitch on the village parking lot has been operated in Gutach - in view of the older cottage.
Two installations that are close to each other: intentions or signs?
This question was answered clearly by Gutach's Mayor yesterday.
"The Councilhaustempel was installed at that time because it secures the school path," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampels secure both bike drivers and bus passengers and the mountains' inhabitants.
The installation that was officially operated yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub›.
"In the high rise of transport and pedestrians, another example was needed to ensure their safety," said Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"On current measurements, the municipality of Gutach, according to the B 33, is about 12 000 vehicles daily, of which about 10 percent are heavy-load transport", stresses Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another specimen is more than necessary: "Security is just going on here," says Arnold.
Overall, four traffic views were carried out, also a circuit traffic was thought, but again rejected because of the tightness in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
It was tested, according to Arnold, at the location selection of the Ampelmasters before: "The means of an extra for us with particularly long wooden strains loaded transporters, we have tested whether these vehicles can drive from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without turning the sulphurs."
The approximation of EUR 15 000 is the "modernest thing that is currently on the market", explained Arnold.
The installation is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights of the drivers are well recognized, for example, in deep sunshine.
And she is also sparing: the older lighting systems use about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
Per drive direction there are three lighting systems.
Arnold explained the technology of the new installation: this is equipped with two radar sensors.
Press the pedestrian button, the upper radar sensor tests the mode of transport.
If the road is free, then immediately green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people go across the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone is safely over the road," explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver has to think as a partner here and observe the bike.
This was not the case yesterday: Few showed the amp for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle came through - in light red.
Joseph Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the need for his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of its Catholic villagerhood - the languagelessness, the hang to raw violence and stumps sexuality, the tightness and the joylessness - have often described the corntn poet.
Known is the Bücher's prize carrier, especially as a prosa author, theater texts are rar in his work.
Collage from Prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher sets up a collage of prosatexts for his performance "weather lights on the tongue peak", which is now seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz.
The theater maker combines elements from the autobiographically marked novel "The Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminatures from "Leichnam, his family charming" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important requisite: a crucible sofa, on which it is copied and masturbated, the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Regisseur Fresacher seems to trust little in the text.
The 70-minute performance conveys the template with a lot of regiment cases, known from the stock post-dramatic game forms.
Especially the actresses come to the occasional somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, with the head swallowed under water, with their evening robes to the wall.
Involved in cellophane or leather, they stuck on dangerous high stalks through the inscentation, either monologize loudly or lie completely stumbled on the ground.
However, the text is hardly available in this strangered way.
The best moments have the evening when it is sung - the bandwidth is enough from Deep Purple to national songs.
First to the end, the overwhelmed performance gets something to rest, and Winkler's afterwards absurd humor flashes up.
A blackbox in the car?
US-American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declined highway system, and believe that the solution was found in a small black box that finds place in the armature board of each car.
The devices that record each travelled kilometre and report the information to the authorities are the core point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the state to review the obsolete system for the financing of US-American streets.
The generally more boring area of road planning has suddenly evolved an intensive debate with colourful allians.
Liberators have joined environmental groups and are presuming that the government can use the small boxes to record the travelled kilometres – and possibly where they have been driven – and then use the information for the calculation of tax statements.
The tea party is disgusting.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while you cannot agree on a procedure at the Congress, several states no longer wait.
They are currently exploring how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, paying for the driver per hardened miles.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing that we'll only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the traveled miles with all California car drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes, pays the US-American on the tax pillar.
But in America there is no longer as much to be done as before.
Cars use less petrol.
State oil taxes of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per litre) have not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to increase tax at high spray prices even for a cent.
Lee Munnich, an expert on transport law at the University of Minnesota, says: “The tax on petrol is simply not future.”
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with driving writers to test a miles-based payment system.
"This is the most meaningful alternative for the long term," he said.
Office crates call it a miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberal sounds, for example, the tax was able to use to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce stiffness and climate harmful exhaust gases.
Californic planners use the system for developing strategies to achieve the ambitionate, statutory objectives of the state for climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also explained that it is the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also incurred by the idea of allowing drivers to pay off the route.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Directives at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in a report in 2011 called on the Congress to move towards miles-based settlement.
Last year, the US Senat approved a 90 million dollars expensive pilot project, which would include 100,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the prosecution and thus responded to the concerns of members from rural areas representing people who often have to spend many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several state and large cities move on their own in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, who currently acquires 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, among which the transport ministers of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) are currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, car drivers were skeptical about thinking that the government could follow each of their movements.
"Anxiety against Big Brother and such things was a major problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Transport Ministry.
The people didn't want it.
When the test began, Nevada’s ACLU warned: “It would be relatively easy to convert the drivers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, blockable technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of state states that are now looking for affordable technology that the State can take up the travelled kilometres, but not exactly when and where.
That, according to Khan, would be more calm about the public.
The chase for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company has originally not arrived to help the state in the taxation of car drivers.
Instead, it was their goal to take foot in a emerging market for KFZ insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the travelled miles.
But the devices tested by them are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
“The people are rather willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," explained Ryan Morrison, Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive possibilities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment to give car drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a fixed fee based on the average miles travelled by all inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrustful public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, transport officers want to develop an equipment for taxation, with which parking fees can also be paid, insurance must be paid only for travelled kilometres and speed data are collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which car drivers can avoid Staus.
"Automobile drivers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits that the system offers to participate," says a city’s planning document.
However, some transport planners wonder whether all the talk about payment per mile is not just a huge deduction manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials declared that the Congress could solve the problem of the Highway Trust Fund bankrupt simply by increasing fuel tax.
A supplementary single fee or an annual charge could be charged to drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient,” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s Head of Legislative and Public Affairs.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of car drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Kingsfeld: Little crew strikes awake
The voluntary fire force handled her autumn head test despite lack of staff with bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
In his exercise, commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in the Burgberger Straße.
There's supposed to have been a short closure at the time of sailing.
Two people were injured by the burning and smoking development, but one of them could send another emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respiratory agents of the war prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead to the free.
The second person had to be weared.
This was not so easy, as a tight staircase was also to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stalling for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
There were also electrical machinery for wood processing.
The first removal attack took place through the tank in the vehicle.
Another line took place through a overflow hydrant in about 100 meters distance.
Now, three eradication attacks could be designed.
A hole beam was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what is to be done with little staff available.
In the serious case, there is a support for the Kingsfeld Day Action Group.
The commander was satisfied with the end of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
At his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzzwald, the country-day president Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt of where the work forces came from tomorrow.
In the High-Schwarz Fonds Centre, he went to this important question together with the executive school leaders of the vocational schools, as well as the circuit gymnasium and the parent consultants.
"Education is an important factor in location," stressed Claudia Stehle, director of Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre High-Blackzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the training model projects.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation in the forest city between the funding centre, the circuit gymnasium and the vocational education centre.
He also praised family kindness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a look at the family phase but also the phase for the care of family members because of demographic change," Wolf explained.
In addition, he suggested that more and more employees cared for and cared for their families.
"Without the support of employers, the burden resulting from the burden of employees can lead to a discontinuation of the working relationship," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For whoever has learned the benefits of the region during his study, with his acquired knowledge and skills is often receiving the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the country-day president was convinced.
Because only if sufficient training spaces were offered, the needs of professionals could also be covered.
In his opinion, the advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already undertaken to develop public passenger traffic on his train trip from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Continue being thorough and make sure that public transport improves," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
With music a entertaining afternoon
Already for 15 years, Kaul's family invites Dietinger's seniors to coffee, cake and then to a vesper.
Earlier, the older fellows were admitted to the barbecue.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place in St. Josef's nursing home.
The inhabitants looked forward to the delicious cakes and towers.
Later there was worst salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich talked with common melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old schoolyard before the renovation to the Kirchstraße is to be set again with the renovation cost plan of the city of Brianlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was built in the first work of the restructuring of the front schoolyard, to stabilize and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further approach is intended to include Alexander Misok from the Braunlinger City Engineering Office in the plannings and to establish a restructuring concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be made by experts, which will then be placed on the Board of Municipalities on the table for the decision and determining the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to fall already in the coming year.
After the renovation, patching and tree planting of the old school farm within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary to set the reconstruction of the restructuring necessary limitation walls from the ground to the refined and for new underbuilding.
The historical, a hundred years old delimitation wall of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since no drainage is available, need to be cleaned and has a boiling forward.
Deep rices in individual stones prove to weather damage, but the wall is currently not in danger.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use a school courtyard, which has been done by the current fixing work.
Originally, the school court sanitation was planned even in the years 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure led to a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall sanation, which has already been used for filming, will be spoken with the National Memorial Office.
If standards come from this page, then the city hopes bridges for grants from the monumental protectors.
The students of Bruunlinger's primary school, who are now instructed again in a well-resolved old school building with new aula, can soon use the old school courtyard.
Özdemir wants Jazzausbildung in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has now started.
"I think it's wrong to give up the entire education at the Stuttgart University of Music," said Özdemir the "Stuttgarter News".
Jazz and Classics are located at the Jazz location of Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, who is considered a favourite for a direct mandate at the Bundestagswahl on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Rote State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this requires a re-order of five music high schools in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, Jazz and Pop are to be transferred from the Stuttgart Music University School to Mannheim.
US border: "Super tunnel" for drug smuggling discovered
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and stopped a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities reported, the more than 500 metres long tubes between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity, rail glasses and ventilation facilities.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could go through under the radar," said the U.S. State Attorney of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in San Diego, where the end of the tunnel was discovered.
Duffy assured the drug bands: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartel.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the exhaustive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that he was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about a year.
The rail system was so equipped that there could be used electric motor vehicles.
On the Mexican side, the access is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel line.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1,20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was caught because of the marijuana seized.
All three threaten as the highest punishment of lifelong liberty withdrawal, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities and not in tunnels.
This shows the "desperacy" of the drug bands whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug flag in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the US.
No details were given to the arrested, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
You have to expect penalties up to ten years.
2014 will become Geisinger Festival Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen at the time of 1250.
Repeat the first urgency narrative is increasingly closer.
When the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary is on.
Geisingen and church houses were mentioned 794 for the first time.
In churches, a certificate was made in which both places were mentioned.
On March 15, there is an official entrance for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this entrance event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
During the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be in July at a festival end from 18 to 20 July 1250.
Repeat celebrating.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall.
At the end of this week, the church house is still a church festival.
City music director Rudolf Barth has written a composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed at three dates.
On June 21, together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed in the anniversary year, the official date is the last September week end, on 27 and 28 September.
At the Geisinger City Anniversary, a new Chronicle is also brought out.
"It is to be a chronic not only by Geisingen itself, but a printed work on the geising of today, which consists of Geisingen, church houses, leipferdingen, Aulfingen and goodmadings," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the Geisingen of today also celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was executed with the memories.
The new Chronicle will then be presented on November 21 or 22 in the new Festival Hall in Geisingen.
However, 2014 is another year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on February 8, with a breadsome evening at the time of its 60-year-old existence, the harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the festival bankett on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1st to 4th.
The Oldenwerk Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the music club Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the spring festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The magazine was made in churches (houses), which were then courtyard.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason for 2014 to celebrate this 1250 year accordingly, the municipal reform is also 40 years behind.
The Council takes tracks into view
Should the train transition "Am Hirschen" be reconstructed to increase the safety of transport?
Yes, the municipal councils decided.
Schildach must take 220 000 euros into account for this purpose.
The German Railway will improve the Kinzigtal railway in the coming year.
In particular, it aims to increase the safety of railway crossings - regularly there are confusions between trains with other vehicles.
If the municipalities agree with the reconstruction measures, they must participate with one third in the costs, the rest share rail and covenant.
Schiltach's city tree champion Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality the specialities of the "Am Hirschen" train transition.
There, the city plans to build a booking at the height of the tunnel wall west of the railgleise.
There may also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, in the case of counter-commerce without having to block the glasses.
Consequently, greeter proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the following road at the given time in order to ensure a smooth flow of transport.
This was discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for road spread: Thomas Kipp, with his comment, put the critics at the point: "Do we have to take so much money in hand for so few vehicles?"
Bürgermeister Thomas Haas contradicted: The train transition "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route, because the 20-meter-long vehicles could not use the route on the Haberles bridge because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirect for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, argued Haas.
Since Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels must be reconstructed and reconstructed, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the train transition "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important transport dimension for a longer period.
The councils agreed to examine the costs that would cause the intended spread of the road.
Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the railway transition was largely agreed with the measure that the necessary support walls are built in such a way as to allow the city to expand the following road towards "roadway" for meeting transport to approximately 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the railway transition at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a very different problem that concerns access to the strongly rising "Rollets Road".
The management had led to the restructuring plans of the railways by the Brainlinger Engineering Office, as it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Gerolltzhaus Weg was still possible.
The investigation concluded that there was no exclusion that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting.
The responsibility for this is to take the city as a road-building carrier.
Consequently, the reconstruction could lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood departure and the deflection were working in the current expansion state, it was not supposed to agree to the reconstruction of the train transition, Haas argued.
Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition should be significantly lower than the other crossways because it is directly above the stop point in the centre where a good vision is connected.
Even trains from the main station would have to be braked down at this point so that no collision threatens.
Most were refused to reconstruction of this railway transition, as the city of Schiltach had to "bath the problem with seating vehicles", so the councils, as the trains could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work has been completed.
The body considers the restructuring of the gates "Before Heubach" and "Before Kuhbach" for which crossing agreements have already been met with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Remote planets, gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were selected, five are still in the race.
Remote worlds.
More than 1,000 planets with other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are at least some of these lives, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Do you want to search for gravity waves?
Or would you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or are earthly planets facing and thereby perhaps discovering outer earthly life?
These questions are just asking the responsibility of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make research decisive.
The unit for such "L" missions is approximately a billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, Paris met the elite of European space research to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of them have now come to the closer choice.
A number of bodies reviewed the proposals, climbing with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
Totally four major questions have been selected by the Esa to find answers to the 2007 launched missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The precise operations in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the creation of planets that surround these stars - are still in verbal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in the world could pass through this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to examine this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will start in 2017, with a more detailed examination of 500 already known planet systems in our nearby environment.
The possibilities are limited, but Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could represent earth-like planets and even analyse the composition of their atmosphere, so as to look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered as indicative for biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to provide ultimate information on the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particulate radiation from it to the planet system.
In our solar system, these operations can be examined in an exemplary way.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-class (the budget is about a half billion euros) for this question.
The Sun will start 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
They want to figure out the role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system.
The Esa provides for the first of the three total L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The Sunde "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start their journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and will examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the ice moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The world room offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and so to examine whether the known laws of nature are still valid there.
There may also be differences that could show the physics the way to a new theory, under which all the known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe originate and what is it from?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos came through the Urknall.
Besides the common matter, from the stars, planets and living creatures as we exist, there are dark matters whose gravity consists of galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy that accelerates the expansion of the universe.
Until now, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first second breakthrough of the urknall, nor do dark matter and dark energy exist.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved an M mission, whose start is intended for 2020.
With a special telescope, the Sond will first examine the distribution of matters in the universe throughout the sky and thus allow conclusions on the creation of dark material and darker energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best possibilities for a L mission are, according to many experts "E-Lisa", a demanding concept for the detection of gravity waves.
This includes physical changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein foretold almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven until today.
Elisa could create this, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides for one of two or three prolonged detectors that are stationed in all.
In contrast to plants on the earth, he could also demonstrate gravity waves that have emerged in the Urknall and thus provide new knowledge of the origin of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", to explore and explore earth-like planets.
Already separated are proposals for the Mars sample back transport, for the research of moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for sun physics.
Snowden will be prepared to cooperate with Germany in terms of U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US Secret Service, declared that he was ready to travel to Berlin before the German Federal Day, if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander do not answer their activities.
The German parliamentary Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum was given to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday of Ströbele, it writes: “Even if the result of my efforts proved positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a fraud of loyalty and attempts to criminalize political opinions with a threat of criminality, where no defense is possible.”
But saying the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to let the charge fall against him.
The charge raised by the US Ministry of Justice includes spionage and theft of state property.
The German interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to time online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to allow that."
The relationships between the United States and Germany are burdensome by claims that the NSA has heard the phone of Kanzler Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who is chairing the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the Secret Service, declared that the opportunity should be given to listen to snow as a witness if this could be "without threatening him and ruining the relationships with the United States".
Strobele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of itself and snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists when he visited Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, he needs a assurance that he is there "safe", then the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he is exposed to a “reasonable and continuous” persecution campaign that disappeared him from his home.
However, it is affected by the global response to "my act of political opinion".
Citizens around the world as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have called the disclosures through an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit of the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities a offer of cooperation “when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been solved”.
Frontier Airlines charges fees for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to hide handbags on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $100 for a piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or limonade, even if in the announcement it was read that passengers should keep the whole dose.
The new fee applies to handbags in the baggage over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars were calculated when the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who only paid at the flight climb.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 is aimed at moving travelers, taking care of the payment in advance.
“We do not want to calculate that sum," she explained.
Airlines started in 2008 to request fees for the first and second surrendered baggage.
Passengers who tried to cope with them have therefore stopped as much as possible in the handbag, resulting in the frequently filled bags above the seat.
Fees are one way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about the most faithful customers of frontiers who would have clearly expressed that it becomes more and more difficult to find place in the field above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may take a baggage free of charge at the frontier flight trail, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar baggage.
O'Malley declared that the frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed about the fee before they came to the flight climb.
The new frontier hand baggage fee will enter into force only in summer, there is no precise date yet.
Passengers often shrink through baggage supplements and other fees, but airlines are pleased to react to it.
They argue that the carriage of the baggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish it.
Many at Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as signs that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of loss.
However, most people have left the fingers of fees for handbags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded first fees for handbags three years ago and later allgiant Air, also a cheap flyer, followed.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully pursues the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand baggage fee of Spirit would bring 50 million US dollars annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, was recently flying with spirit and was curious about what would expect him at the flightsteig if passengers were faced with the unusual handbag fee of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the most smoothly experienced in my course in aviation," he said.
I expected to see dentists and handsome discussions at the flight gate.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding ran as smeered.”
Frontier also follows Spirit at the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice would be expected to keep the whole dose and be filled with coffee for free.
Water continues to be free.
U.S. Airways had tried for a short time in 2008 to demand money for refresh drinks, but this returned seven months later after the passengers had complained and no other large company had been pursued.
Frontier's step to raise fees for the handbag if passengers are not buying directly from the airline is the latest initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per sold ticket.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers for direct purchase with them instead of via an online travel agency.
However, frontiers have gone the largest in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half so many miles of livestock flying when booking over an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route.
Therefore, a flight booked by a third-party provider with a frontier of more than 1000 miles will only bring customers in another 250 miles.
Passengers can book only for direct purchase on the website of Frontier places.
Frontier has a faithful customer stam at its seat in Denver, but the business is diminishing and the company loses money.
The redemption decreased by 9 per cent and the flight capacity decreased almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, as shown in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Mother Group, the Republic Airways Holdings Inc...
Republic has tried to manage the finances of frontiers in the context of the sale of the company.
Proverbs From the Bible
Well 40 women visited the last female breakfast this year in the evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipality house was "Speakwords from the Bible" and "Treatment from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, Chairman of the Church Council, entered the Bible’s vocabulary after breakfast.
"Speakwords contain life wisdoms, regulations or warnings," she explained.
It compared several proverbs with the appropriate scriptures and explained the significance.
She called proverbs such as: "Wait the eye of wood, as sheep fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone, the Lord gives it in sleep, wash his hands in innocentness."
Multiple times, the referent also gave advice to her listeners, which proverb it was.
The Middle Ages languages adopted the church monastery Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue make, something devastated.
It explained the significance and origin of the speech applications she called "bridges in the past".
To conclude, a Tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were surrounded with humor before they were delivered to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, the Mayor's candidate Roman Waizenegger was also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for untrained tourism
On the Mecklenburg lake plate, they launch a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already untrained in the industry are to be qualified to professionals for hotels and guests over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert by the work agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained professionals who were increasingly missing in hotels and hostages, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The industrial and commercial chambers in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA explains that a “internal error” and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the website
The tremendous National Security Agency declared late Friday, a mistake has lamed its public website a few hours and not hacker as it was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable tonight for a few hours because during a planned update a internal error occurred”, the spy agency explained in an email message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure had been caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours, and this is still not available for some users.
In the past, a NSA speaker had explained to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, so the speaker.
At least a group of hacktivists used to lamb the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website will be overflowed with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site is collapsed.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to enter the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (No such authority), is now found in the light of the public and is experiencing the discoveries known in recent months about its extensive monitoring programme in the domestic and abroad, a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service fired initial speculations about the incident today is the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without jobs was slightly lowered by 22 to 1.307 in October.
Although the quota was 3.1 per cent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, vice-president of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far responded to settings.
One reason for this is, according to fielder builder, "We have hardly professionals in craft, health and old care".
Annual terms and conditions have also been available for staff in the hotel and hostage business since September.
In the middle of December, the winter season begins there.
The whole background report is available in the Allauer advertisement sheet of 31 October 2013 (page 33).
Winses in Bombardiers after decline in delivery numbers and contracts
On Thursday, the Canadian Aircraft and Railway Manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decrease in net gain after being under pressure by declined orders and deliverys in the third quarter of aircraft and contract problems in the railway team.
Bombardiers with seat in Montreal also did not publish flight test data for his brand new plane of CSeries and did not provide new information on whether the plane could be commercially used in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
At the virgin flight of the test plane one and a half months ago, only three additional starts followed so far, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is running as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course crash of more than eight percent on the stock exchange of Toronto.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, analyzed at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of "outperform" to "sector perform" in order to ensure that the share has a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
“We were expected to have weaker delivery rates in airplanes most widely, but we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer's letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program advances for the aircraft.
However, if no new orders are made available in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can cater the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was presented in March of the public and fled for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, so far, binding orders for CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new airline are applicable.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 mandatory orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management insured analysts and media that the programme was in the agenda.
“The test plane has not remained on the ground any longer than expected,” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the standing time of the plane, ground tests and software updates were set up.
Each manufacturer plants differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, as we have done.
This happens during the entire flight program.
The second of five test planes is expected to start in the next weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was called the company side.
However, analyzers remain skeptical whether twelve months after the virgin flight of the first customer can operate a plane of the CSeries.
Bombardier explained that it verified the plan for entry into service (EIS) and will update it in the next months.
“The slow advances of the flight test – even if they are obviously consistent with the internal Bombardier’s internal planning – strengthens our view that the entry into service is moving to the first quarter of 2015”, said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30 Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share a year before.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
The turnover declined slightly and declined from 4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a fall of 57 last year.
The net positions fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The contracting stock in the air and space partners was $32.9 billion on 30 September and was thus unchanged against 31 December.
"In the area of aviation and space, the results were within the framework of our requirements, but the low intake of contracts and market conditions as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
The turnover in the air and space partners fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway producer, announced that the turnover in this sphere has increased by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The contract stock in the transport team was $32.6 billion on 30 September and was slightly increased compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the field of transport was affected by the problems of settlement in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier shared 8.5 percent and was 4.83 Canadian dollars, after also announced that the Google Finance Board Patrick Pichette will change to the board.
The Brazilian embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10% decrease in quarterly profit on Thursday.

Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must be in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, forwarded information on subworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by Liverpooler Crown Court to three years in prison
A known criminal defense who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be detected, was sentenced to three years of prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about research on its activities in drug trafficking after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer praised by criminals with the nickname “Bash” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug procedure.
Officers observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a food of the lawyer's chamber.
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed drugs of class A after tests had found trails of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the context of a major investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were arrested later after the police secured a number of home searches of heroin and cocaine at the value of 1.5 million pounds and 200 000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, transmitted information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors Office in Blackburn, was found guilty and condemned at Liverpooler Crown Court in two points of charge, following a three-week procedure.
He admitted the cocaine possession in a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage tone.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned with Ditta, who was at the dinner at the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
It was known before the court that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after testing drugs of class A had been discovered in his hair, his wallet and on his credit cards.
Itta was later arrested, but he refused to take cocaine and said that he spoke to the contemptful dealer because he was his client, and claimed that their discussion was subject to the lawyer's secret.
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and he was taken a hair sample.
In the case of police interrogation, he claimed to operate both under his private address and at the workplace a office and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It was known before the court that he had called on important actors of drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, for significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Staatsanwalt Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than all others that you do not break the law."
Itta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defense, as he has been excessively committed to certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just one of the drug dealers, but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He counteracted police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus brought his professional status into appeal.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta revealed any misbehavior and claimed: “If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to give information to Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but do so immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said of the police in Lancashire: “Lord Ditta has made the step from a criminal defense to a criminal at the moment when he began to purchase drugs from organised criminals.”
His independence of cocaine led to a hopeless compromise and made it susceptible to the motives of leading members of the organised crime, who ordered him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has declined this trust and is trying to go behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a condemn in three cases due to the possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals before court.
This case should be a warning for criminals and show that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years of prison after he declared the conspiracy guilty of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Fifty and thirty others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total punishments of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published a range of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and inequality is the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
To conclude the celebrations of its 160-year-old existence, the Dunningen song kranz will embrace two services with the "German Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which the audiences enthusiasmed this spring this year, the song crown at the end of the anniversary year will enrich two services with the performance of the German Messe by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday 26 October, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 on the evening fair in St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10:15 p.m. at St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Messe with the original title "Songs for the celebration of the sacred sacrifice of the fair", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of the creation.
The fair is listed within the framework of the service, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the blowing group of the music club Frohsinn teethbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis weakens seen confidence
For example, with the elections to the parishmenat in 2015, Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally in the soul care unit.
There is then only one common parrot for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because the essential decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is necessary for the parishes to implement them as satisfactory as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepsis to the new one turns thoroughly, but it seems to be a suspicion.
From the ideas and expectations to the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the priesthood, the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the soul care team were sufficient.
On the basis of a presentation, the Regional Dekan Georg Schmitt explained the newest directives for seal care units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg.
Afterwards, the SE Haslach forms as a church community a body of public law which enters into the rights and obligations of six individual church communities so far.
There will only be a joint parish ment and a foundation council in which the priest's power office is represented.
Each parish shall represent at least two selected members, in which six parishes are formed on site so-called community teams.
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future.
There was a significant need for discussion in the question of the finances of the individual parishes.
The renewals provide that collected funds are maintained in the parishes.
On the other hand, the commitments are transferred to the general community.
Just with regard to the large investments planned, whose commitment then meets all the parishes, there were great concerns.
"In the past, only projects that could be managed by individual priests alone have been invested," Haslachs President Bruno Prinzbach relatively said.
Practical experience with a joint body for five priests, Barbar Ritter, chairman of the body in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made themselves a task in 2006, "Become one, stay five," and they had to find that this is not so easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslacher's Seal Care Unit then took to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish and the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concrete at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the next spring.
At the end, priest Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was agreed with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As confirmed by the manager of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, compared with the SÜDKURIER, a four-headed Pfullendorfer family 70 to 90 Euro additional costs per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC environment from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This conversion is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the large power trails.
These include the additional costs arising from the energy change which they can raise through a circulation above the electricity price.
The city works of Pfullendorf form the last part of this chain.
As Jörg-Arne Bias reports, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher circulation in its forecasts.
Now the concrete payments should be calculated before the city works could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We're going from an increase of 1 cent plus x," said Bias, where the number is going to be rather close to the 2 cents.
Aim of permanent red: Watch waiting time
Sometimes an ankle just doesn't get green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What then do you do - ride at red?
If a person concerned waited long enough for a red amp and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgarter lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before a disturbance of the amp.
However, whoever continues to drive despite red light, must be aware that he is blamed for an accident caused by it.
If you are tolerating less than five minutes, Becker may not wait long enough, warns and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes, a driver had ignored the amp and had to be responsible for a negligible red light violation.
Indeed, the amp was not defective, but just a little later, then, on green.
A driving ban remained sparing him because of the special situation - but not the penalty.
The municipality's council is pleased with solid budgets
Whenever it is about the budget at municipal meetings, mayor Ralph Gerster is laughing well.
The communal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts have been no longer known to the administration since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be booked as a full success.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 financial statements.
Andrea Rothmund explained that the administrative budget, with some EUR 7.6 million, was over a million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget also amounts to around EUR 1.8 million over the approach.
The surplus is mainly higher in profit and losses and the municipality's share of income tax.
The asset budget was also significantly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially the higher inclusion from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
As investments were less than planned in the 2012 financial year, the surplus was also higher.
Totally, the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to total EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothund and her team for the good work.
"So a work isn't just shaking out of the herb," Gerster praised with a view to the annual account.
He and the municipal councils were clearly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradox, but precisely these good figures could soon be expensive for citizens.
Through the good financial situation, the municipality in the past was able to refrain from high rates of lifting.
However, according to Gerster, the country has often reduced subsidies.
For these grants from various compensatory stacks there are conditions.
Among other things, the cities and communities applying for grants must provide certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of raises, since in the coming years, investments we would like to have grants for," announced Gerster in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years of singer, Hubert Wermter's history is at the men's singer club Cäcilia almost twice as long as the herbsfest, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his men's singing union on the stage.
Even after 60 years, his singing with the now probably more than lovely choir is still making great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Referent on behalf of the Cecilia Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, gave him - since the choir is also a church chord - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues gave him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a graved tenteller.
In addition to honor, the 31th autumn festival was in common railways: With the MGV Betra, the Song kranz Salzstetten, the Baisingen singer department and the local music association, the Fullmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different chörs and song styles, which the approximately 400 visitors interviewed.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with voting songs such as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Lusty, your brothers".
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared them to honor a little bitch - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts 'Bundeslied'.
The men's singer Betra also sang classic choir songs like "Jägerwerbung" by Julius Wangert, "wide, far away" from Hubert Goisern and the people's song "When you go through the valley".
The Song Crown Salzstetten, with his mixed choir and his female group - the "Impulschor" -, provided for the female rate of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulsor" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sports Association came back with "What is the Swib?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Paperts "Bierlied" in the home, where the Fullmaringer Musical Association offered the crowning musical graduation.
For the kids there was a small adjacent program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore stollsteim led up a casperl theatre and read a few stories that the kids were busy about lunch.

Kenian press disturbs the controversial media law
"We are in a distressing situation, and we may ask ourselves: What does Parliament reject to simply eliminate judicial independence tomorrow?" was to read in the newspaper which considers the draft law not constitutionally.
“The law is draconic and very punishing and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Chamber of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites of Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be set up, because it is an extended arm of government” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us and we call on him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government would have suffered “a heavy stroke” by the new law,“the media effectively into a cube.” However, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speaking in Kenya, describes the draft as“draconic”.
The adoption of the law is part of a number of measures to strengthen national security in the post-ahead of the attacks by armed Islamists on the West Gate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenian media raised the anger of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which it was seen as the units sent to the Tatort claimed to rob the luxurious shopping centre.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded to the submission of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the preliminary request was withdrawn after a call of the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million Chinese shilling and individual journalists with up to a million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or excluded from an official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to capture the possession of those concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “a single punishment can push most radio channels into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on those described by the "lively blogosphere" of Kenya.
If they need the media to quiet, politicians could do unpunished whatever they want.
“No one will ever experience it,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at the nation, who calls the Chinese media for a decisive control factor in public life.
"If one leaves politicians himself, they lead the country into the bankrupt and us back to the time of the hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already raised public harassment in the past.
In May, they agreed to reverse the reductions ordered by the national remuneration Commission and to re-establish their due wages of about 532,000 shilling free of tax per month – they are among the world's highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
Despite the cold weather and rain, the official dedication celebration for the artificial breed sports area was nothing to do with the importance of the city and the football club.
It seems that a more pleasant celebration was the last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play.
So all those who came without a rainscreen or couldn't hold one for any reason.
The musicians who embraced the festival, as did some speakers.
Nass also became the FC Chairman of Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks was to all former Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, to the Municipal Council, the participating companies and association members.
Especially here Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty pensioners moved 400 square meters of patch stones for the new roads.
This remarkable honorable commitment also appreciated the country-day member Karl Rombach.
Other greetings spoke for the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South-Badian Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, announced a donation for the Youth Department of the Club.
Mayor Klump reminded that in spring and autumn, the recurring white-related influences were added to the original racing site so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem when the construction of a third place at the ground of the football club or at the real school at Salinensee was imagined.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago there were thoughts about the construction of a artificial race sports area, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were launched two years ago when the FC took over the Erbpacht studio, awarded a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and approved the land funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000, summed together.
The construction of the 68 times 108 metres large artificial grass area took place on 4 June.
During the continuous construction phase over three months, 3000 cubic meters of Earth was deducted, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike stroke.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with internal and justice issues.
To this end, the responsible working group gathered in Berlin in the morning.
These include direct democracy, parliamentary control and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions on migration and integration.
The issue of double citizenship is likely to be, among other things, in which both sides have contradictions.
The SPD wants the force for immigrant children born in Germany to cease to decide for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
In the field of transport, which is not on the agenda on Friday, the SPD supported its no to a car wall requested by the CSU.
A vignette was a "flate for multi-running and thus ecologically contraproductive", explained the SPD negotiating leader for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat to interference on rural roads, which are already the main points of accident.
In addition, the introduction of a wall for all cars would only be a first step from view of Pronolds.
"The risk is that at a later time the compensation for Germans will be deleted," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing feather wave on the light scene
Stuttgart - "When is it going to be the right summer again?" wasn't actually the question on the Killesberg freelight stage on Friday evening.

Vienna Airport receives passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Surrender like this will no longer exist at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in future.
Most of the loudspeakers are dropped away - the noise level is to be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As the airport speaker Peter Kleemann announced against Radio Vienna, the airport Vienna follows an international trend with the setting up of permissions relating to individuals.
So, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already dismissed from the narrowing calls.
By the disappearance of these insistences - averagely 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - it will go quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual passions have been observed relatively little, but at the same time all other information about altered flights or departure times here a little bit below," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio broadcaster.

Overview of milk and egg alternates
Vegane diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Purified tofu with plant sauce is, for example, a quarker rate.
Other names the Vegetarian Federation for the World Vegetary Day on 1 November.
The Vegetarian Federation Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives at the time of the World Vegetary Day on 1 November:
Pure plant margins are a good alternative to butter, yoghurt let replace with sojajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soja, harvest, mantle or rice milk can be used.
Remarkable plant sours replace conventional strokes.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
A half broken, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or an apple of lean seeds painted plus three dining lemons of water are suitable for this.
Locker will be teyer instead of eggs, for example, with a mixture of a target leaflet of back powder, an apple of food strength and three edible mineral waters.
But also 50 grams of sojajoghurt or silidentofu can meet this purpose.

Sleepless in New York
On the way to their guest families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest gymnasium met the American major city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached to walk.
Here was already a fascinating look at the world-known Skyline, which is a special irritation in the evening light.
Through the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but trust the motto "The city is not sleeping" was decided on the day at the Times Square.
Despite shutdown, the statue of freedom could be reached on the second day with a ferry and climbed to foot.
Afterwards it went through the financial centre around the Wall Street to the Memorial of September 11th.
On the third day, the students were able to win an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373 metres high view platform of the Empire State Building.
Afterwards, the hectic drive of the New York streets went across the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to stay shortly in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have arrived in their guest families and experienced the school everyday at the Weymouth High School.
This year also a Hubertus fair is celebrated on the name of the Holy Hubertus in the church of St. Marien at the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the story after a rather unreasonable hunter, which was converted by a vision and later appointed as a bishop of Kleinich.
The Hunting Horn Blasers Group of the Jagdreter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musics on Parforce Horns (Natur Horns in the mood Es) after old, originally French melodies.
The leaves wear riding clothes because they mostly accompany horses, horses and dogs on mud hunting musically.
The festival fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 p.m.
The newly designed cover shines with a new cafe.
One that invites to stay and come back.
One thing that wants to make the name a program.
According to Lexikon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of visiting the same named café at the opslag in the district town of Kleve in the vicinity of the Rhein-Waal University, it does not have to stay at the clean Déjà Vu-Feel.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has just the aim of making a real stay not only convinced but manually repeatablely experienceable.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into inner life at the opslag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The high-modern but not cool cafe ambient looks like a place to feel well.
Here, the team ventures the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name before opening the delicious café at the lookup as a gastronomen: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the opslag, the sympathic cafe lovers hope to be more audiences.
Not least also through the university.
"Where we have no specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Instead, the two young students here want to respond as well as the elderly and all age classes.
Apropos Café lover.
The sympathetic owner's couple is behind the coffee genus.
Enjoys the smelling hot bridge in the various variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more the Expresso-Fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker.
"There's a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," found the two 33-year-olds.
But not everybody's thing.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is also not a prominent fan of event evening: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event, I always talk to those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be more the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the entirely normal operation as little as possible."
To be said: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful environment at the lookup in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomy miles.
To the joy of many clevers, the guests from close and remote and the students who discover the gastromeiles and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A Day of Thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were pleased to come.
In the association room of the "Witteborg" guesthouse in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious relationship in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the appropriate solidarity to take honor.
The special award "Singers of the Year" was now delighted by the writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not just written much for us, but have also turned some round for us, for our heartfelt thanks," said the Chairman of the Chores Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the appearances and choir samples by actuaries went to the Chorchef Dieter Schulze this year with 44 participants, followed by the honorary president Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
Place five occupied notekeeper Artur Brückner.
In particular, the board addressed the team of Vereinswirt Ange Pier-Ribbert, which once more had taught a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" always meets his regular choir samples on Tuesday at 19.45 a.m. in the club room.
"New song-joyed voices are welcome at any time," said Schlotmann.
The UN announces new targets in the fight against poverty
The United Nations are starting to draw up a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals for Poverty, which were announced 12 years ago.
In front of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of sustainable development targets, which are to replace the Millennium targets that run out in 2015.
You were included in the final draft document adopted by world policy leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
In the evening, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to adopt a process to be agreed with the universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the 2015 Framework for Development.
I will not shout the efforts of implementing this mandate that the Member States have given me to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the Millennium targets."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball superligists continue to have a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Yet, I hope we'll finally win again.
"For I don't even know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-party reserve from Fredenbeck hasn't yet screwed out trees, Malmon is warning the showing finger in front of the field.
Many players have been trained by myself in the A youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is possible to wait for then to be reinforced from the first," explains the SG Coach.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team must in any case increase compared to the previous appearances.
In front of all things in the covering work and in the shift game, it was last huge.
The use of opportunities must also be definitely improved.
So I hope my players have finally got the head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of conflicts between influenceous individuals
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the guardful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique to vote for peace calls in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, manager of an investment company.
In fear of the country's future, she has exchanged her business clothing against a T-shirt with the label "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the number on Thursday at the independence site of the capital.
For almost two weeks there have been reports on conflicts between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst fights since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, which was initially supported by the White Rhodesia and later the South African government in order to destabilise the independent government of the country.
According to the 1992 peace agreement, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a grown conflict, but the recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
For the rapidly growing economy, a lot is at stake because the discovery of huge gas incidents before the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the next few years.
The governing Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blames each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent conflicts by attacking its members in the Province of Sofala, a traditional Highburg Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos Speaker to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the conflicts and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama viewed himself as a loser who “will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force the government to make his decisions”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement.
Against the FT, he explained that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to reopen negotiations and seriously," said Mazanga.
Earlier discussions between the parties have helped little to eliminate the tensions fired by a number of conflicts this year.
“We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide with the heads”, says Joseph Hanlon, teacher at the Open University and Mozambique experts.
None of them are good in negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing on election reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a violent movement to achieve concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral success has shrinked since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM) founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza, whose departure occurs when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He wants no multi-party democracy, he wants no transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the President's office," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacities Renamo has, but it has undertaken unresting attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most fights took place in the Province of Sofala, a few hundred miles north of Maputo, whereby Beira is located, using the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things were not good in Mozambique,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, the dramatic progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave.
"The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrant, said that people just wanted stability.
“No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to get back peace and useable streets," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “examples for life”, one author says.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal power has no chance to resist smart tricks” and the Artus-Ling shows how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths are, however, “to far too wild, too stumbling and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools”, why Crossley-Holland was concerned with a “careful selection” of old-right works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this for twenty years as a plan.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who are “excessively didactic” children would“ turn off complete” because in entertaining stories the messages would be“ subtle”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Angelsaxian and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: “You can pursue certain purposes, but you should keep them in the background as possible.”
The greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and a writer for children is the need to communicate hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the Happy End, but there is an imminent sense of good and evil.
This must be subtle, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob took his age rest in Haslach, and his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many audiences were enthusiastic about the very short-term scene game.
From the arrival of the granting of the honorary citizenship to his death, Wringbook Author and Hansjakobmaker Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which received a lot of appreciation under the regime of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained associations and overwhelmed times from youth to nearing retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, to his courtyard.
And then the scene game, in which Alois Krafczyk once more glanced in his parade role than the great son of the city.
Stilecht went on with the two-stone and "Black forests of foxes" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received from the audience with a lot of applause, but also his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put himself in the role of the sister and gave her unhearted life in Mimik and Gestik.
Between each play scene, Mühlenbach's farmer chapel played suitablely selected music pieces and rounded the performance off.
For the award of the honourable citizens' dignity, then Haslach's Mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor that, in the representation of the then official owner Hättich, together with a part of the city council, made his awake.
Their waiting then made the three kings singers who led Hansjakob to the exclaim: "Ah, as beautiful, there will again be youth memories at my own three-quarter time alive."
With their song "O Jesulein" they rejoiced the audience in the courtyard as well as the kids of the shower day with their loud "Out, out."
His criticism on the official church at that time had expressed the same concern as his concerns about developments in agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war.
In the homehouse, behind his grave chapel on the fire at the courtplace, he found his resting place.
"A distressed spirit had finally found his peace and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene game.
Many applause and many praiseful words were found by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Riesen grows
The possibilities for the liga remaining of the sporty declined Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballers have increased.
Because there should be a wildcard procedure, then there is a less competitor for the Neckar Riesen now.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball project refrains from applying for a possible rear rear space.
"We will not participate in Wildcard procedures," said Ex-National player Pascal Rolr, who has been setting up the concept of a professional in the Hanse city since 2012.
However, a first respiratory was not to learn from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure, so long as it is not established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, Upwards Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the arrival court and prove its economic federality.
However, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The arrival court is the last instance.

Snowden could also say in Russia
The former US Secret Service Expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in its Russian asylum in the US-Peaport Fair.
Representatives of the Federal General Advocate General could either ask questions in writing or personally meet the 30-year-old in Russia.
This was noted by the Interfax Agency by calling on unauthorised circles familiar with the situation.
A question like this could be resolved between the Member States, it was said.
A trip to Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is allies of the United States, Snowdogs threaten the delivery there, it continued

Schrill pepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested strongly in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hold.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard uses, among other things, wind plant logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the camping lot in front of the deck.
Distribute or reload the coal here, as necessary, by two huge blue hoods and recharge devices.
Whenever the envelope moves, a sharp alarm sounds over the ground.
"The signals serve security and are legally required," says Matthias Schrell, director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of unfavourable winds, this is much to hear - and there were already some complaints from the city's array.
He takes the complaints very seriously and therefore has contacted the concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close agreement with the authorities, we are now keeping the warning signals with technical measures.
He will also set up open dialogue with the neighbours in the future.
Because Matthias Schrell has some more in front of the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to import coal for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe.
Thanks to the 18,5 metres deepened form of terminal, capesize bulk career can be completed here forever.
"This year we want to hit the 3-million tonnes mark on the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, the importation of coal goes to inland power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still going to the network, there are some 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year realistic.
The three ship-loaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketballer despite the first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not decay huge optimism in the basketballers of FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can forbid us to win against the best team of Europe in the last two years," the Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic accounted for after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the title-defense of Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
During their first third appearance in the European kingly class, the coins sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
First, the guests created the piece of art to convert a 15-point back to a guide 13 minutes before the end, before pirous gave again a turn to the game.
"We have been fighting back incredibly against the two-fold Euroleague champion, but then made lightweight mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful advertisers of the Municipals who had celebrated significant victory in the first two parties against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish tracker Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago, the variete artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre at the Broadway, began to tell the amount of jokes in the form of a conversation.
During the years Fays innovation was developed, as last on the New York Comedy Festival.
This year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headlines started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were sometime too well known to appear in a club," said Hirsch.
We designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year, there are events of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as of "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual musical and comedy beneficiary event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby occurs.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has grown.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known through more unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a sitcom in the cable TV (the ironically-sleeping fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has its own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation both at “Saturday Night Live” and at “Parks and Recreation”, although she was the most famous for her viral video series “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young Comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, concentrated W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American Comedy.
One of the largest visitors' magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but developed as an audienced TV and film director as well as an inofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television broadcast with the title “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV country.
The meeting takes place in the city hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me, when he's here, he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfies with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is pleased with the negotiating process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN territories and Germany.
"Now after years you have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences of the last years," wrote Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way, but the nuclear manager is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end both sides come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Kids kill game chambers with makeete
Two children have admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 - year - old boys had invited their victims to go on bird hunting with them.
With Macheden and knives, they armed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in a worker's district before their apartments.
The body was found next night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive beach town Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five - year - old half sister of the younger one who had taken her should say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl before the police described the tathergang without mention of an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder named, among other things, a rivalry in football game.
He was provisionally admitted to a psychiatric youth institute.
Holder must go to prison
Due to exploiting human trafficking, holding, threat, insult and dangerous injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years' prison.
The former Federal Army soldier, who worked as a door manager after two operations in Afghanistan, gave a confession in the context of a process agreement.
Therefore, in five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts that he sent to the strike after a few weeks against their will.
He maintained opposition with violence and threats.
The income of women purchased for him for some years retained him.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he interrupted contacts of women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who communicated the women, he brought them into different board cells in the southwest.
There he let them partially monitor to control their revenues.
In front of the court, the accused first claimed that he suffered a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died at an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychic restriction and thus a limited debt capability, the 33-year-old gave a comprehensive confession.
The court had no more to know the damaged women.
As a Kripo official reported, after an initial advertisement, at least four additional cases of human trafficking could be determined by telephone monitoring measures.
The interviews had been marked by high aggression.
In later announcements, the damaged would have confirmed their martyrium.
Another witness, one of the women had discovered blue spots on the whole body, has not made any statement until today.
It is "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this meteor as normal.
The defendant regreted his behavior yesterday.
"He dissolved himself from these circles and wanted to live a very normal life after prison," he said.
Oil price continues up to USD 96 per barrel
The oil price has also continued to fall on Friday after concerns about a high offer overestimated a report from China's energy-hungerous production sector.
In the late morning in Europe, the reference raw oil varieties for deliveries in December fell in electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large raw oil offer has loaded prices in recent weeks.
On Wednesday, the US Energy Ministry declared that the US offer increased by 4.1 million Barrel last week.
Over five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million Barrel.
On Friday, however, there were indications of greater demand by two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the variety of Brent, a reference value for international raw oil, also used by US raffinadery, fell at ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision to stop and freeze Directive of the NYPD
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had requested the changes to the Stop-and-Frish program (‘Stop and Browse’) of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a call of the city was decided.
In August, the judge sentenced that the city infringed the constitution with the way the program for the stopping and questioning of persons is implemented.
The city initiated a call against its assessment and the ordered remedies, including the decision to establish a monitoring body to assist the police in the amendment of their Directive and the appropriate training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments concerning the required suspension.
The appeal report explained that the judge must be dissociated from the case because she infringed the Code of Conduct for American Judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the Court.
The judge had judged, police officers injured the citizens' rights of tens of thousands of people, because they in an inappropriate way aimed at black and Latin American men with the stop-and-Frish program.
It appointed an external body for monitoring the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme with cameras carried on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared ready to stop the practice of storage of names and addresses of persons who were released after a police control.
An oral negotiation for calling the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-fric-tact has been criticised by a number of civil rights prosecutors.
Controls of this kind have been in different forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded increased during the term of the parteilosian mayor Michael Bloomberg to a constant height of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities were complaints that developed as a collective complaint.
Advocates of changes to the stop-and-free program of the NYPD say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and more effective police and influence the way other police authorities use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen police morality, but not crime; and would also waste money and do not solve the broader problem of a police who is under pressure after the departure of thousands of posts over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-fric praxis that is constitutional, but only reforming the type of implementation of the controls by the NYPD.
From the Happy of the Dreaming Cameles
Happiness is an oase that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this proof, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "helping hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott in 2004.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the site on several trips.
During the talks, pictures of the bets on a large canvas were shown, so the guests of the anniversary event could make an image of the actions mentioned.
The desert vehicle of the association has also been shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prevo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to provide this vehicle with a photovoltaic location and now, according to Henne, plans to operate in advisory function at the association.
In 2008, the roomei Schleh from Baiersbronn created the hospital station in Socogim, an elusive district at the edge of the capital, in the record period of nearly a week.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times in which the birth clinic is to be rationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medical doctor, such as her, for example, disappearance against burn-out.
Due to the political disturbances in the country, it was not possible to make as many travels as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to visit here in various areas.
In addition, containers are regularly sent to Africa with material, so in March this year medical equipment, medicines, bonds, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered abundantly local colorite by telling from Mauritania from Mercedes-Turnel converted to its mobile goat, and depicting the experiences of the family home musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, moisture stressed that the global economy also demands global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria it's not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking for checking a hint
The former news of the Word Publisher Andy Coulson claimed "telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" to try to confirm a wrong tip about an affair of the indoor minister Charles Clarke at that time.
In May 2005, State Attorney Andrew Edis QC explained to the Old Bailey Court that News of the World heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and followed them, but Coulson also called her and left news as the court learned.
“In the opinion of the lawyer, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, is no one who is standing in front of the apartment of people and hoping to capture them on fresh deeds, but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said, NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories researchively: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently he knows of the second, the monitoring, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He dismisses this, but we say, "And if he knew of it."
Announcements about an affair Clarkes were first taken up by the feature editorial of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found records on the computer of the detective, where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time of the research, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls when they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
In the meantime, the former Chefreporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup monitored Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as former minister David Blunkett.
On Thursday, the sworns heard that Coulson Blunkett had faced with a married woman because of an affair when he had lived with Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks are struggling to have sworn with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned rich tax, the French football will actually pass the first strike since 1972.
A settlement meeting ends without results.
In the conflict about the rich taxes, the government and the professional fussball in France have manoeuvred into a sackgasse after a failure to settle a meeting.
President François Hollande received on Thursday in the Pariser Élysée Palast of Association and Association representatives and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to remedy the football from the planned 75-percent levy on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hard.
The Streik announced by the end of November will now also be carried out, the Head of the Association of Proficlubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The play days in the ligue 1 and the Ligue 2 are thus in place between November 29 and December 2.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to integrate the inhabitants early in the planning," mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
Approximately 80 participants had arrived in the municipality hall in order to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and bring ideas.
Huußler made it clear: "The final decisions are taken by the members of the municipality council."
The high water, which was unprepared on 15 May 2009, had been an important event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, says Häußler.
A river area study had been carried out with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many farmed lands as possible is the goal," said Huußler.
The planning of protection against a German weather service is based on statistically every 100 years to expect high water.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent grant.
This is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masss that led to significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 represented a 1000-year high water.
"There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement we can achieve," said Huußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClima, approximately four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality of State grants of approximately 70 percent.
Häusler, however, pointed out that there is only the promotion if a general concept is implemented.
The municipality is relying on the involvement of the citizens.
A planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, the implementation can be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept that has been presented in the municipality Council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the flush of Irm from the Stammheimer Tal.
Following the presentation of the high water protection concept, participants used the opportunity to submit their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and restraint pools were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kohn, expert planner of the commanded Engineer Office of Forest and Corbe from Hillsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needs the interaction of all presented measures to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, one was held to find the most economic solution, says Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
In the case of ancient people who suffered from overload of the channel network, even during normal weather rains, was discouraged.
The problem is familiar with administration and the first measures have already been taken.
Häusler, however, pointed out that the directives for channel systems are different from those for high-water protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two- to three-year rain events could be undertaken.
To dimensionate the wastewater channels more, millions would be swallowed.
Heavy injury after collapse
On the early Friday afternoon, on the country road 44 near Revensdorf, two drivers were severely injured during a frontal collapse.
The police immediately locked the road completely, but could only say little about the accident.
However, there are various witness statements that should be evaluated first.
It is firm that the 19-year-old linkrin of a VW golf went towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles broke together, whereas the woman was so toughly sticked that the firearm needed almost half an hour to release her from the vehicle wreck.
First, the actual cause of accident remained unclear.
Both accidents arrived in nearby hospitals.
The route was locked up about two hours.
You could call him the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazing the relativeship in the outside: the squeezing eyes, the bart, the high forehead.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski can understand with his massive Oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is quite alike in his own country.
Some tracks appeared in the Heyne publisher, the Haffmans-Kassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand ones.
Dick explains America - the empire of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security disgusting and faith, being chosen.
Dick had godly experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, he had put drugs on his brain.
He realized early that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person distinguishes from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the "Blad Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is very important now.
The "minorities report" came from the year 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
It is developed here the principle of "pre-crime", "pre-crime", that is what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In the Dicks world, which is like our horrible, mutants look forward to the future - and the police attack.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the Head of the Authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And, "In our society there are no grave criminals, for that we have a prison camp full of pessubreakers." They read time streams.
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal idea from being transposed in fact.
Thick story works like the blue break for the anti-terror laws and the hearing noise of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: Obamas Drohnen philosophy and praxis also works.
But Dicks Story's not finished yet.
The Chief of Police complains that there is no more division of violence, the military controls everyday life - and what's left of the state.
Then the guardian himself is supervised and transferred to a future crime.
The system turns through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It finds out its own conditions.
Take wrongdoers and victims not only in purchase, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick's reading means always to get closer to the truth.
Seafare about Merkel in Russia
The former US Secret Service Expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US-Peaphor fee about Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Advocate Authority could either ask questions in writing or personally meet the 30-year-old in Russia, the Agency reported Interfax.
Before yesterday, the Green-Bundesday member Hans-Christian Stöbele had hit Snowden in Moscow as the first German politician to talk to him about the affair.
Increase NSA disclosures Corporate Paranoia for State Monitoring
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deeply over the US Consulat in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's capital.
Instructed by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Federation (BVT), the German Home Service, he should photograph the U.S. extra post roof, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of monitoring antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the USA and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again claimed in September that the United States did not use the possibilities of abroad spying, “to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US-American companies in order to improve their international competitiveness or profits.”
However, since Edward Snowden, who became the Whistleblower's only employee, with the publication of his filling horn to US-American surveillance secrets, is no longer sure whether they can speak to the director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spioned the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the companies have brought paranoia to a new peak for State surveillance.
The fashion of overrun brought the disclosure that the office of Angela Merkels phone had been cursed, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can show, business management will certainly also be potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States now represented almost the same risk as China when it comes to industrial spionage and data stealing, such an survey published by the consultant company EY in July.
However, in the documents submitted by Snowden, there has not been any evidence that the United States has transmitted the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concerns about the lack of certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce their dependency on the United States.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
In the Federal Day, we were proposed to build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"This is not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal through cars to agriculture.
Everything to the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical refinance of the US spy authorities discovered by the Snowden discoveries shocked companies who had previously seen the largest spy risk in China.
Cloud Computing is a major change because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the United States are subject to the law and are therefore potentially endangered.
According to an investigation conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, rejected the disclosures of the US data mining activities with a price of about ten percent of the members not resident in the US plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Vice-President of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers who weren't there a year ago – she says: Where will my data be stored and you can guarantee that these are physically in this judicial area?”
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they knew anyway, namely that mighty states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at any price.
The fact that economic spy is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
“It was a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Chemical Company BASF.
The Americans spionate us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
The management of companies usually does not praise about the countermeasures that have been taken, as this gives attackers benefits.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick on a trade fair or unwaited leave of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackberk, member of the Executive Board of Auto Manufacturers Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing devices.
The German BVT advises leaders to use simple prepaid phones when going on foreign trips because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain attackable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective Nisches.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources in order to protect business secrets effectively from unauthorised access”, the BAT warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic spying by other countries.
According to Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel were ranked behind China in two of the countries used to purchase economic data from the hacking.
A member of the Board of Directors of a German Blue Chip Company agreed when it was about economic spying, then “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former leader of the French Home Secret Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The Secret Services know very precisely that, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, all countries spionate their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe gives answers to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery that man can do," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
One trend: The Retro look has retained.
This starts at the wedding clothes.
White is Must, best covered or in cream.
Forewards, the often rusty and sticky clothes are closed, often with a leather, but backwards they go down the back and often end in a trap.
However, the spirits differ, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house of clothes.
In men the suit dominates with West and Plastron, but it can also be chosen cream-coloured or brown combinations.
Important is the selection of the local, has been explained.
Jewelless adjacent rooms are not optimal, the ambient should be special.
Here the domain made attention to their own offer in the Remise.
Then whoever wants to walk with the cabinet, your link has an offer for him.
"But kids are also popular for boy cells' birthdays," he says.
Romantics are also asked for invitation cards, flower events and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion the "After Wedding Photo" - so recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flowers arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
To not forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successful
For the repeated time, the athletes of the dog's friend Bitz were successful on a Rally-Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in candle with two dogs; with his herd Sandy, he reached 94 points in the class beginner and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month Marley he brought it up with 87 points.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody, in class 1, set the critical views of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a collapsed ringermatte in the turn hall of his high school are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the United States of Georgia was found on 11 January in a upright mathematics that was behind the Tribüne in the school tournament hall.
The research officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which questioned the family of the 17-year-old.
“You are convinced that their son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
You never believed he died as the sheriff concluded.
“They believe that any logic does not violate the laws of physics as well as the healthy human understanding”, Crump says.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is confused to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school and came back in the body bag,” he commented.
On Thursday, U.S. lawyer Michael Moore said there will be a formal investigation to Johnson's death because a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained that at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is an adequate basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson died from the consequences of a "positional incense".
A second autopsy, however, has resulted in another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added, if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation to kill Johnson, he will order the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in southern Georgia ordered that the authorities should release all the surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of how he died.
CDC Publish allergic guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for handling food allergies from children at school.
These are the first directives that have been published by the U.S. government, as the number of school-related children with food allergies increases.
One of 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The Guidelines include information for schools that are intended to raise awareness of food allergy in the educational body and employees and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin in stock – the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most frequently used – to meet a potential fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The lawyers in the state have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something pushes on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it" or "My tongue crushed."
Parents of intersexual children can choose “Gender Uncertain”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with non-clear genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned to stare male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex to such children, but can indicate “undefined” or “not defined” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the Law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make overhaul decisions in relation to operations for a sexual assignment of newborns, and to combat discrimination of intersexual people.
An intersexual person said, according to BBC years later, "I am neither man nor woman."
I'll keep the flickpiece created by doctors stumbled and full of herbs.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children each year will not come to life as a boy or as a girl.
They belong to the intersexual, a group falling under the diagnosis of ‘sexual diversification disorder’ (DSD), a collection concept for people with atypical chromosomes, chemistry (eggs or fevers) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States recommend that you use the best available information on gender assignment if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the child’s psychological and physical development before you decide – if any – for a surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “applies to a good thing”.
Intersexual children represent a ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not,” he said.
You can make a sexual assignment without surgery and then wait for the development of identity.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersexuals are different from transsexuals or transgeners, because their status is not sexual, but is subject to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in successive sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breast and stature, priorities of sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that is exposed to intersexual and transgeneral persons in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Inconsistent with the gender image, boys now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, in Australia and Nepal, it is possible for adults to specify male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australier Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "generalless" person after a court had granted the lifelong maintenance of a "undefined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German certificates will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, as the Ministry of Interior.
In nearby France, sexes are still controversial, according to a news message to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the Strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "Gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The US-American website Catholic Online has also argued against the German law: “If the world is distorted into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two other pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she might feel better when babies are assigned a sex at birth.
“The parent is already stressful enough, especially if you don’t know the sex of your own child,” she said the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female gender parts were called heraphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine viewed the sex as something that could be eliminated and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical bases of a surgery are doubted, after now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a “psychiatric emergency”, said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The dominant theory of the treatment of children with unclear genitals is based on Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the sex was formed.
He characterized the term “sexual identity” and argued, social and environmental contradictions – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized whether a person viewed himself as male or female.
But in a case known under the title “John/Joan” from 1966, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated at a disgusting circumcision to cast the child completely and also to remove his shots and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not”, said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he went back to the male sex and married a woman.
When he was 38 years old, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with Internet access, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public, which are “not happy with the result”.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, born with XY male chromosomes, but two-defined genitals.
The doctors were not aware whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never live a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and the Hoden were removed in surgery shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“I knew I was not a girl”, he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unfortunate, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But as he was depressive and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical documents.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosteron injections and left his breasts to be removed.
Through the surgery, he has become infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organisation called Interface Project for intersexual people to be considered normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, CEO of the lawyers for Informed Choice in California, is concerned that the German law can ‘stimulate and encourage stigmatisation’.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make fast decisions and to give the child a ‘not defined’,” she explained.
We're afraid that's favourable to interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian Law, because “who enables adults to recognize as third sex”.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex," she explained.
The German law concerns the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force young children at that time.
When they are grown up, they can decide on their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-assistration group, says that the German law “powered” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD named complete drug resistance.
Due to the recipe order effect of target cells for testosteron, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no eggs.
Today, Katie 29 is married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the child psychiatrie.
Although she is infertile, however, hopes to be able to get a child by adopting or by a parent.
“The law gives parents space, which does not have to make decisions that are overcome,” Baratz said.
It gives them the time to make different tests and to settle things and give them time before they write “manly” or “girlfriend”.
In this way it's all right – you take the child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent's happiness.
And you don't have to do a surgery that can't be undone anymore.
“That includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents embrace, because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision itself.
Unknown injured girl by shot from car
Unknowns have injured a 12-year-old in Sachsen-Anhalt at shots from a car.
On Thursday night in Genthin, the actors probably fired with an air pressure gun to a group of children.
That's what the police shared in Castle.
The girl had easily been hurt on the left Wade.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car who had gone in front of a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The actors also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
They then took away.
The police detected it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only two times for egg-casting children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the home owners recognized this in time and the egg residues immediately removed, there should also have been no damage.
Furthermore, some Sylvester balls were probably ignitioned in the city area, but there was no damage here.
A resident at the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was incorporated with clone paper and his bicycles were disposed of.
However, until the police arrived, the man found out his radiation fences in the immediate vicinity of all, so the police had not to continue to work.
Living with a future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives dreamy.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes of public transport.
"You are hopefully not afraid of spinning?" asked Waltraud Ries and pointed to a fat spin at the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spine phobia, but the concern of not being able to deal with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment at the age, she explains.
In addition: Since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifty girl has had to learn on his own body, what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Recently, a book of her appeared on the subject 'Happy living in the age - What is the best way to live?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on in age', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today with mid-fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that it belongs to the few people who are at all dealing with the topic of 'residents of age'.
Most people are disappearing it as long as it goes.
Ancient people are always becoming the other ones," she says splendid.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really high, you think.
"Then it can be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior architectin presents 17 living models for a self-defined living in the age.
'What form of living you choose is always an individual decision,' she explains.
D ie solution does not give it for age.
Even those who could afford the age rest in the Tuscany or Bretagne should always think that he could become sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country, you can also unite in Dolce Vita,' the professional author gives you to recall excellence willingly.
Their models include classical care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted pensioner-WG.
In the age, everybody has his tickets and Mackens
'For me, a living community would be nothing,' she meant with an eyepiece.
Not even as in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
'If you're old, you just need your withdrawal rooms,' says Ries.
However, the book author does not want to exclude the functioning of an elderly community.
But then this must happen differently than in the classical students WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest," she believes.
In this regard, at least in the capital of the country is it not alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it goes in their own apartment' is also the experience of Theresa Roots, the leader of civil service life in the age of the capital of the country.
Your service advises people around the theme 'Become older'.
Therefore, just older people would often also take inconveniences and restrictions to buy only to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the foundation product testing.
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends all those who are dealing with the older-right rebuilding of their house or apartment to inform themselves thoroughly and not commissioning the best craftsmen.
Today there are also specialists for the age-right reconstruction.
Even in the rental apartment, it is somehow realized, and if it is only the toilet seat elevation, the inner architectine is clearing up.
But not always, the existing apartment can be redesigned olderly and thus accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to do Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the stairway that was also paved with stairs to the door of the apartment would be the much bigger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move it greys her more than before the spine at her door.
The United States wants Snowden to continue to pursue criminal law
The United States has not changed their attitude to the former US Secret Service employee Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be conceived to have transmitted insecret information.
Therefore, he had to make a criminal procedure in the United States, said the speaker of the US Foreign Ministry, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent comments of Snowden would not change anything.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had called on the USA not to threaten him further with punishment.
Psaki emphasized that in Stöbel's statements it was a parliamentary and not a German government member.
Secret ServicesHüller Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This has clarified the former NSA employee sought by the United States in an unadressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Stöbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to federal government, federal day and general lawyer.
The letter contains the following words:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your investigation for mass monitoring.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contractual or a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
During my employment in these institutions, I was witnessed to systematic law breach of my government, which caused me to act on a moral basis.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw a serious and persistent hette that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently alive in exile and enjoy a temporary asylum which the Russian Federation grants me in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged from the resonance on my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have assessed the disclosures of a system of overall monitoring, which no one is responsible for, as a public service.
These spionage disclosures brought many proposals to new laws and directives, which aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust.
The benefits of the society from these findings are increasingly clear and the risks taken in purchases have been significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts proved positive, my government Dissens continues to treat as a fraud of loyalty and seeks to criminalize political opinions and prosecute them.
Yet, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will decline this absurd attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties are attached to this humanitarian situation, I will be able to take part in the responsible disclosure of the facts relating to the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and legally.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared and thank you for their efforts to safeguard the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden witnessed by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Children's garden has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterling's mayor Michael Maier.
The former children's garden in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
At its recent meeting in the non-public part, the Municipal Council agreed to sell.
The building changed its owners at a "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied," stresses Maier.
In the budget, EUR 100 000 was set up.
Still, it is not clear how the new owner wants to use the former children's garden.
The mayor is right that wintermen have given the responsibility for the building before the winter and therefore no longer have to come up for the entertainment of the house, such as warming, looking for the garden and riding the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The music club Hammereisenbach offers a place concert on the terrace of the host house Hammer.
When Dirigent Bianca Willmann lifts the tactstock at 19.30 a.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
President Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
Honeck thanked all those who helped to manage the first musician hock successfully in this framework.
Report: Obama campaign planned to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest consultants of President Barack Obama have in secret considered to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election battle with Hillary Clinton, says the New York Times.
The discovery is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is a copy of the book that will appear next and she reported on Thursday evening that the President's top consultants had carried out “great group sessions and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out whether Obama's hope of re-electives would look better when he let Biden fall.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leaders of the campaign and of the White House, namely to measure the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, the effect it has on the survey values to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the nearest consultants of the President – including Daley, the former campaign leader of Obama, Jim Messina, and the former leader of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
In “Double Down” it is claimed that Daley was at the top of the efforts to exchange Bid despite its “severe, personal relationship” before one finally decided against such a chess train after the data showed that the Candidatur Clintons would “not significantly improve the chances of Obamas”.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government really thought to replace Biden with Clinton.
“I expressed a number of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley explained to the magazine.
We have to remember that the President at that time had terrible survey values, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley described the investigations as "required care", Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the re-elective campaign, considerable efforts have been taken to find out whether such a train is payable in terms of the election tours.
"In campaigns, if you don't seriously think about something, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about a exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his dawn boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley declared that he did not believe that the President was "conscious of the possible change," the former Staff Chief admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew of it.
Martin added that "Double Down" does not give a definitive answer to the question whether the political explanations had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama didn't know anything of the investigations about whether to let bids fall in the elections.
“ Possibly,” said Martin.
What happens with my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Were the letter secret technically transposed in drafting the Internet service, similar to the conventional post?
The conception of early Internet services was in the forefront of making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account the creation of a stable foundation for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postal card rather than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", then the computers are directly connected?
Anna's e-mail client or browser sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step.
For example, if she had a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider used by Benni.
On the route, the mail can run across several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will conventional emails be read on their way through the network?
Most mails are read multiple times by software robots on the road.
The provider of the sender will normally check whether the mail leads to a damage program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an unhappy and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted away in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail on their coming holiday trip, Google can provide appropriate links to vacation offers.
Reading the emails with unknown people?
The probability of unauthorized persons to read a mail is very low.
Theoretical, however, is this possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The criminal persecution authorities and secret services also have legal possibilities to capture or notify emails.
There are possible illegal outlet actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
Encryption according to the OpenPGP standard allows an email to be encrypted effectively against completion.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to diminish the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize the person who has communicated with.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
In the mainly privately used mailboxes Yahoo and Google, according to an investigation by Convios Consulting in August 2013, only play a subordinate role.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had last fallen, GMail of Google was able to make it clear.
Mother in the forest worsened and retired
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg smote a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest and continued to cash their pensions and care money.
In order to get further pensions and care money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigating the police in the forest.
First he devoured the death of the 89-year-olds, then he took the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
Hence, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time it was noted that the careful mother was no longer required medicines.
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because the officials made this strange, they continued to determine.
It found out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally granted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy did not suggest a capital crime.
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first lighting ice in the dark – using quallen.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a bright leakage from them.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on Quallen and was able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the bright protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when consuming with the tongue, which raises the pH value in the protein and triggers the light.
Chris explains that the food is reacting to the heat in the mouth and lighting – the more you leak, the better it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and then you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH value increases and the ice lights.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it on the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the vault fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet cost me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leave gold.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is incredibly impossible for itself due to the fraction of light caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream consists; but I suppose we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a qualde produced artificially by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball Verbandsliga after six play days.
It is now calculated for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated the last weekend of his first victory.
With this game the season begins new for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," gives Ehlers a optimistic behavior.
Finally, with the exception of the long-term injured Hendrik Bloome, he has his entire frame available.
Daverden also puts us on pace.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
Firstly, however, there is an increase in the coverage, which has left everything other than a safe impression.
The Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is clearly relaxed after the first seasonal victory against North Horn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because everything can always happen in Derby.
Still, Panitz now wants to post in Morsum to start a series.
Missing will be Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Young Joost Windsuit, who is active with double play law at the A-Young Federation League HC Bremen, celebrates his seasonal debut.
Whoever isn't hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: in figures
When I was young, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweetness, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today, I've become a Halloween-muffle.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself ready to distribute my apartment from sweetness, and I think it will not do this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep with respect to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion for sweetness, costumes and decorations, according to the United States Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween again is the trend values.
The costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the US dollars spent on 6,9 billion, according to the NRF.
This year's exciting unleavened objects of the last cry.
Women don't have to put themselves in sexy clothes anymore, they can now also embrace lucrative food such as pizza, Hamburger or carrots.
As regards men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that the daft-punk world-room men will make it in the Instagram Feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are Zombies, Batman, Pirates and Hexes.
I suppose it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not to my surprise alone.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As regards sweetness, we are not perfect.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year for it, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate gels, lutschers, bonuses and rubber bears.
So good news for the U.S. trade Ministry 41 million people who go through the quarters with the saying "Süßes or Saures".
Actually, we will buy over 40 million kilos of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't make anything – eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold to Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweetween Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corns.
It's a puzzle I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses in which it spooks.
They have great names such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which remains in a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized spookhouses in the United States, who achieve 500 million dollars of redemption, America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pink into your pants and then put the friends on Facebook, where you won't get rid of them, and then one of the guys on which you stand, leaves a comment as "non-faced expression".
But finally, let's get to the pisses.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Kürbis when we were kids, and the cutting of a cube is like the jewelry of the Christmas tree – something we made from the small.
Fortunately, the “Baby in the Kürbis” run started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up by cropping the Kürbis and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend approximately $106 million for cutting bites, according to the US Census Bureau.
The cherries, slowly rotted in the front garden, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of cherries were harvested this year.
If you want to do the right points, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something nice from their 921 kilos of heavy cherries.
Apartment fire in Helmrecht: Rescue forces mountains cold body
The firearm had to go out in the helm right late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches on Friday fire in the night.
The rescue forces store a cold body from the house.
Rescue forces have found a cold body in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it's a resident, it's still unclear, as a speaker of the police in Bayreuth said.
The late Thursday evening it had burned at the ground floor of the house.
When the firearms arrived, the flames were already hitting out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The whole ground floor was damaged.
All other inhabitants had not been at home during the fire, the police speaker continued.
The building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause for the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest country church has launched an open-label to advertise for the occupation of the priest.
Background is a possible lack of priests: The Evangelical Lutheran National Church Hannover expects that the number of its currently approximately 1,800 pastors will half up to 2030 after the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily course itself.
With Burfien, the National Church has for the first time ordered a pastor in full place to enthusiasm young people for theology study.
At present, fewer young people decide to study theology after the abitur.
Burfien leads this back to the process of degradation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the lord of my appointment calendar and can put my focus there, where it is important to me.
Pastors could be close to people as a soul career.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
Surely the free economy will pay more, but theologians would have a safe employer for this.
This comes to the young people of today, who are not just career, but a sensible work.
According to the National Church, which includes three quarters of Niedersachsens, about 60 pastors are currently retired per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their Vicariat.
In thin border areas such as the harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy positions in the future.
Burfien wants to arrange for young people and also invite prominents who have studied theology.
The theology study offered a wide range of training.

Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior you will find Rennsitze and Six Point Gurte as well as a free-speaking facility.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with the care of Bowler Works mechanics and logistics support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for a reachable way to world class events.
We are pleased to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format creates new possibilities to experience the various Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare new ones for the straps and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Ways – this will be an entertaining mastership.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firewear called for salvation of a cabbage that sat 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock spring in a rock break
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had escaped after a small transport accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in a rock break in her malicious situation
Firefighters sailed down to the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The firearm managed to put a cave in security, which was trapped on a 15 meters high front in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a rock break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the rock break of Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to take Ruby back to reception and thank you for the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and published help calls in social networks when she ran out of the small traffic accident into the rock breakdown.
About 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker, who carried out his dog, saw the run Ruby on the 15 meters high piece in the rock break.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the place and drove off to the rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “It was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn't move any muscle during her salvation – she was frozen as steep.
But now she's okay.
She then eated a few dog cooks.
That was a pretty unusual effort.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a great luck."
It was the possibility that she was very severely injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian, but nothing except exhaustion and dehydration was detected.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “It was terrible to see rescue.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the poor.
The veterinarian explained that if the fatigue had become too large and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The fire Forces have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed above.”
The firewearmen were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
At an interview with an Australian radio broadcaster this week, the Pop Star said that she worked as a background singer at Jagger's song “Old Habits The Hard” from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the old rocker in the evening, and that “he had snatched me when I was 18 years old.”
She added: "It's been a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In an explanation, a representative of Jagger, 70, on Thursday, said that he “catically denied that he has ever made approach trials at Katy Perry”.
The representative added: "It may have confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest trip this year at the Rolling Stones tour.

George Kerevan: European disfellowshipping gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about pass controls in Berwick and a border secured with stacked wire along the Hadrian wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed out the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this – as expected – did not matter in the tables.
No one has also mentioned that the EU Member States often turn to their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-respect for Brussels would only be a little consent against what you really want from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one who has come so in the years that it is already like a fossil: for the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" ends at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point of repeating this old history is lost.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pipe?
Why is the London yoke exchanged against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the big plan for the union of Europe, which has been established after the war, has been put to the stake.
With the Euro-crisis, Europe's project has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties who are enemy of the EU or wish to throw the euro as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Euro-Skeptic Party has been able to launch an alternative for Germany – only this year – almost five million votes at the Federal Day election in September and thus effectively dismiss the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the strict savings policy that Berlin and the European Central Bank have committed in conjunction with the forced jacket to which the national economy is required by holding the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the cause of excessive budget deficiencies by national governments – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has established its members on exchange rates that are advantageous to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devaluating the local currency, South Europe will find a built-in productivity disadvantage to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deep European productivity problem behind the current ethics and monetary problems.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays the double for electricity and the fourfold for gas compared to the United States.
This is a damaging cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage statements do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner from cheap American skiing gas.
As a result, a revolt rises, especially in France, the first cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France viewed the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be kept in chess and Paris lifted with Washington.
But Berlin does not need Paris more than the gateway to political legitimation and has stressed Europe's own economic policy, with which the attacked French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pens judicial, EU enemy Front National has just won a decisive call and thus referred to the governing socialists to place three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voters – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to embark on an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well cutting out at these elections – and that is very good possible – then the European Parliament could first dominate such a block.
This is the point I want to go beyond: in the not too far future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the 'Europe of the Suvenant Nations' which favoured General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distinguish from this project in the hope of flirting with the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific area points to the fact that the United Kingdom will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland staying with all of them?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including to tell Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suppose Scotland could go well in a more relaxed European union if we maintain our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federed Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing it equally to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against the savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) reductions responsible for the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Life Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for an independence, only to then force a saving policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: grow faster
Afro-American and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white agemates, as studies show.
Body changes do not mean the puberty directly yet
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic fattyness is a trigger of early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less marked in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who has specialized in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time on calming parents – usually this is not a sign of the rapid entry of the puberty," explained Kaplowitz.
Clear ads of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axle hair, as well as body smell, appear in girls earlier.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of menarch (incidence of first rule bleeding) in the past 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12,5 years, something less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years to the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Frühe Pubertät in Girls: The Essential Advisor to deal with this frequently occurring problem".
Time is the most accurate test as the puberty advances.
It is controversial, which actually represents the beginning of the puberty, but it is true that the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth rate before eight years of age.
In most cases, the process is slowing down or stagnating – something that a child doctor can closely monitor.
In the case of faster advances, tests may be shown by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and the defence of another consequence: premature ageing of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is reluctant on medicines, but he admits: “Suppressing the puberty can facilitate behavioural problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their age.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or about how to handle the hygiene side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter with ten days had her.
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came terrified and excited from school home because she was the first in her friendship.
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no clear evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causes.
Boys come into the puberty like girls before.
Caplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of fattening.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, creating a link between body fat and entry into the puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, afro-American and hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white ages.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, a early puberty seems to be influenced from all possible things, from economic conditions over climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although kids grow the face and shame hair before, the trend to a complete previous puberty is not as marked as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP Conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shamhaar is spread even in babies and young children.
"We must be careful as we identify the true beginning of the puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their child’s doctor how to talk to their child.
“That can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected,” said Kaplowitz.
If you stay quiet, the child usually responds well.
Girls who are blooming early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters earlier than planned.
Jumbo manufacturers argue with large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a debate on the width of seats in the tourist class in long-speed flights, which indicates the sound for a bitter collapse on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seat width that passengers are offered in long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most endeavoring to airlines, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims for the latest airplanes of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus demanded this week a industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US-American arzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft builders are fighting to sell even larger versions of their two-engine longitudinal planes, and at the event of 17-21 November record orders.
As the rear part of the plane is designed – especially whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is decisive for the specified economic results to provide the new mini jumbo design.
Boeing claims that his modernized “777X” is 406 persons in the tourist class, which are more than 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft agents often distribute their technical details through advertising in the specialised press.
Now Airbus appeals to the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed money providers a picture where three people are sitting together in a restaurant, with the title "Will you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-speed flights in seats that are closer to regional turbo props," says Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
In view of changing dietary habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the data of the US Health Ministry.
The number of numbers of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival is adhering to a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the freshly baptized “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing objects the numbers of Airbus to the seats and says that it is not in the manner of the manufacturers to decide how airlines form the balance between air fares and equipment.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It is really about to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they need to think to be successful”, explains Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate them what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anybody else.
For passengers it is more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly a topic that can affect the turnover.
A race for flight orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at list prices in the next decades, which could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe's export balance sheet.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest two-engine long-line designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-site Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeings statements on the results depend partly on the comparability of the 777X with its 10 seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increases in costs per unit are still lower than in currently used machines with 10 seats per row.
"Boeing therefore quetschs more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analyzers, full cabins with ten seats per row of existing 777s pointed out that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, which could be related to cheaper flight tariffs.
“Eightteen inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from a economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabining, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world traveling jet sellers even carry band sizes to measure the establishment in the competition.
Even if they prize comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-value design for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-site rows, but has not yet sold according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability of cabins and offered wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without support from the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be pumped, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin vaccine could make the fun of smoking the garause
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human tests, further trials are needed, which may last a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches”, says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information about the production of nicotin antibodies.
The virus infects the liver cells selectively, which then produce a steady flow of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotin molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain, which makes a smoker not experience nicotin high.
In trials vaccinated mice to which nicotine was administered kept their normal activity level.
Mice without vaccination would have taken a “outtime”, the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and unpractic.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be given to people if he was sure to be given children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But more likely is that smokers would use him to stop.
“Then they know: when they start smoking again, they are no longer enjoyable because of the nicotin vaccine, and that helps them to lose their habit”, he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi contested to be influenced by Obeid
Against the former Minister of Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a investigation is initiated by the State Corruption Supervisor.
The former NSW minister argues that the arrangements for maritime plague should have changed upon request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had concealed shares in three lands on state-controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) expanded its investigations on the question whether Obeid had influenced various ministers in order to extend pacht contracts at the Circular Quay, where the obeids operated two restaurants and a café without an invitation to tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi knew of Obeid's concealed interest in the lands after Tripodis's former vice-president Lynne Ashpole had pronounced it accordingly on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had insisted on public procurement for the Pacht Treaties.
The baggers were opposed and wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the Circular Quay company's contracts, which entered the obedience annually, were extended $2.5 million without a public invitation to tender.
Tripodi, who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken for public tenders.
However, he refuses to have made the changes on request from Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged to transform the government's pocket schemes.
A telephone description submitted by the ICAC showed conversations from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a manager who had changed to the port departement after he had worked under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Is the subject discussed in this telephone discussion the preparation of the commercial settlement arrangements?" asked Vice-President of the Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi answered.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli battle planes attack targets in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting planes would have attacked a Thursday target in the Syrian port of Latakia, confirmed a leading government employee against Fox News.
The official did not explain the objective, but said it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, it was the objective of Russian SA-125 Raketes.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air hits on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign employees with 457 visa could be subjected to ‘realth test’
In the context of expanded measures, the government considers a ‘realth test’ for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
If the test is introduced, it would have a criterion to use to prevent the use of 457 for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the addition of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a discussion proposal from the government was published after the former Members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be condemned by the neighbours of Australia.
“Sound explanations such as ,shore foreigners are supposed to rearward” and ,Supposing Australians first' are a very unpleasant return in times in which trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region embark on an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The draft debate covers twelve measures, once taken by former Minister for Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Immigration minister Brendan O'Connor, who lived yesterday on conversations about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still considered.
If the ‘earthfulness criterion’ is accepted, then a person applying for a visa could be verified as to whether ‘the application is real in cases where the applicant is related or personally linked to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company.’
In addition, companies could be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after, in the past, companies who wished to support only a small number of workers have finally stopped hundreds.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old sri-lantic asylum died probably on a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia is cared for a adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British Government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and northern England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister for Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project “will bring Britain closer together”.
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown declared that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated costs for building the high-speed road between London and North England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, who is in discussions with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to search for further route capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of at last three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We go forward with HS2 because it brings huge advantages.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity crisis in our network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "The announcement today is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael urged to use “inconsciously” for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed railway connection offers the potential of huge economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides a argument for rapid railway connections throughout the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed railway connection in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the connection of Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government already plans.
I am looking forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British Ministers next year and to jointly decide on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft are provisionally in force in Australia
Australian passengers must also continue to turn off tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the United States to relax the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, view or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, if they are in "Flight Mode".
During the majority of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find it angry that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and land.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the US-American airlines to do a lot of work, but do not follow immediate plans to amend their rules.
The air navigation authority CASA also stated that the announcement would be viewed, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia remain.
"The CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft," it has been verified.
The issue is subject to provisions that provide for airlines to maintain safety at any time and to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin staff.
Virgin has already led to flights with the CASA discussions on the extension of the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system and declared that it is open to changes, but they should be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after offering ( wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a speaker.
Qantas declared that you will remain in the current regulations.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices are not allowed to be used when starting and landing, and we are currently not planning to change that," the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US-American airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has different effects in US societies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the radio disturbances by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand bag programs and customer instruction.
“When an airline has confirmed the tolerance of her fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height”, the FAA announced.
In rare cases in poor sight, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the devices while landing.
The group also recommended that more heavy equipment be safely swept over the seats when starting and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB-adhesive trailers with light missiles had been provided for horrible scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football alliance against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost exciting acoustic that offered to the viewer until shortly before the approach of the Federal League game between the German Vice Champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Iduna Park signal.
To be heard were mostly the guest fans with their singings.
On the other hand, where the most faithful - and most loud - BVB fans stand, the South Triboon presented itself exceptionally quietly: no singers, no battle calls.
The capo's podest, which otherwise coordinates the joint fire, remained inconsistent.
And at the front of the tribe, lonely a large flag wounded with the label "Section Stadion Ban".
Only when Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, it burned short-term joy.
When his team colleagues followed, there was loud song and wound shells - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribüne, nothing was right.
Also that the stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derbyg victory, victory on arsenal, prolongation of contracts by Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide celebrations.
Only five minutes before the puppy, the Capo climbed his podest - and the up to then just with hands grabable tension devoured in a loud cry, when the thickness as usual asked the mood on the ranks of the stadium.
Lastly, as always, the South Tribune was on the row - and finally again as usual was here the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, when the loud call "Therby winner stands on" came with a pitch from the South Tribüne, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB adherents had fired light missiles into the viewer lines and to the place - with almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller.
The game has been seen late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of Dortmunder Ultras in his office after that - and believes Watzke's words, this was a rather unpleasant date for the fan representatives.
"It will be massive cuts for the entire Ultra movement," announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening on a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As a prompt measure, Watzke banned the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden that," he explained.
The zero-tolerance policy in matters of pyrotechnology we cannot give up.
In addition, the Ultras has been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction until the end of the next week.
"That's going to be incisive," insured Watzke.
You may be excited as the reactions to the south tribound then come out.
Pfand houses tree in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
In a pand house in the shopping centre of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a couple of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapur dollars each month (approximately 1,730 Euro) as an administrative employee and also works her husband, she explains that the monthly family income is not rich.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – is so high that ValueMax, where she has made her exchange, became the third pand house that is listed on the singapur exchange.
The promotion of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapur dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan.
Typically, pfand houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank demands, a local credit provider with a branch in the same shopping centre.
Pfand houses, however, offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of creditworthiness or income evidence here, which is why loans are faster possible than in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pfand houses after families feel the pressure through increasing cost of living and increasing budgetary and consumer debt.
After five years of steady growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a more relaxed financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium income are looking for pfand houses to compensate for the difference in the stumbling economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly through rising hypotheses, described as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia stands at the top of the list by 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
National economic operators are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has little come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed an ongoing weakness of exports and the lack of consumer demand.
“In the final effect, this means that in view of increasing costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Sang Wun, Economy at CIMB, a Malaysian Bank.
Historical ceilings at gold prices in the last two years have further strengthened the trend in the promotion of personal items, as people use the opportunity to convert the family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the plagued items are in the 200 pfand houses of the city state of gold.
The people say, "The gold price looks good, let's put our grandmother's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20-percent customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pand business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, so Ja Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company finances that by 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it took this week with the exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors were put into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yes explains that pfand houses are not only more favourable than other borrowers, but also not directly raised debts.
“Customs pay goods that they already own, and the liquidity of personal value items does not increase the budget protection," she explains.
The Pfand Loan is increasingly accepted as a short-term, secure funding.
Not all people who use pfand loans are also in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to pave gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
To us customers come from every social layer.
"These include prosperouss who borrow something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small companies who have to bridge the banks in the cash flow," says Yes.
Sometimes they also just need very fast money.
NSA cleans data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service enthüller Edward Snowden has a principal interest in helping Germany to inform the increasingly bressing NSA spheres.
Following the presentation of Hans-Christian Stöbele Green-Day Member, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, was about the conditions under which the former ministers would say to a German prosecutor or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian Health
The Australian Government consists of the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health, in order to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth will take "inappropriate measures" to remedy a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government advice with the independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has cut a package of emergency rescue that we believe is dealing with the unique challenges faced by the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million instant assistance for election services.
Other 2600 surgeries, including orthopaedic interventions and grey star treatments, will remove residues.
In addition, there are money for daily hospitals in Hobart and Launceston, better care for stationary stays, medical training, psychiatric health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas that I have been affected by hospital workers that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister was responsible for a strict report and accountability of the Tasmanian Government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-headed Commission is set up and aims to ensure that the state provides healthcare as efficient and efficient as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the 325 million dollars would only benefit if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government that she had responded to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the public health system of the state from the concern list," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these election services will largely compete the recent cuts.
But the health policy speaker of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a "palate solution".
"We are therefore in today's position because the laboratory state government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government takes almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth in 300 million and then acts like the good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to ensure that not one dollar of the rescue package is spent for additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
Syria destroyed important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and guitar gas munition, explained the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while there were serious collisions in the north of the country near one of the sites where considerably toxic substances are stored.
Similarly, on Thursday, an Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed soon three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
1 November, which the Damaskus organisation established in the Hague had set to destroy or "unperable" all the facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machines for the mixing of chemicals into poison gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule aiming at the destruction of all Syria chemistry weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has to start destroying existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including nervous gas and nervous gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira took place on Thursday, the experts said there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites, as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, established in Great Britain, announced.
The Activist Group, who pursues the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, explained on Thursday that 120.296 people died.
These include 61.067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the sides of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the Army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Libanese Hisbollah milits.
Likewise among the dead are 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100.000.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assads troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but no details.
The fights underline the danger of chemistry inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from his toxic arms arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a civic civil war.
According to the OPCW, who cooperates closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen all major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and experienced their destruction.”
Therefore, "there are currently no further inspection activities planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of the reviews and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus.
Because of security concern, the inspectors said that the visit of two institutions would not have been possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC explained that the two sites were, according to Syrian statement, “resigned ... and the existing objects of the Chemical weapons programme were transferred to other listed facilities that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of his chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee.
“I draw the hate against the courage and courage you all have shown when you fulfill the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
Since then, for three years, the most sensible Muslim rebels in this civil war have fought against Assad's government and their security forces, which belong to many of the Alawites, a dismantling of the Shitish Islam.
With regard to further developments, Rami Abdurrahman, the Head of the Observatory, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Wrath on judgment for Bombs of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had died at the bombing in Bali in 2002 reacted angry about the judgment for the last of the instigators who were brought before court, since Umar Patek was supposed to be shot standingly.
Patek, who was nearly ten years on the escape of Southeast Asia as one of the most seeking people, was condemned yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bomb attack to a 20-year prison sentence.
He could be released after 15 years of penalty.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder due to the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A debt claim also took place in a number of terrorist-related charges, among which a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia included Holybend in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a lifelong penalty, even if it could have applied for the man who, because of his reputation, is called a master bomber, also called "Demolition Man", who could have applied for death penalty.
The decision has raised painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin girl Jane and Jenny in the devastatation caused by Patek and his companions almost ten years ago.
With tears, she said Patek should have been condemned to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him before a shooting command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with that I won't get any more grandchildren and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made equal to the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 a.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small loader parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer had an explosive-filled backpack.
After the attack, he fell into the coma for a month and died three times, while hanging on a lifekeeping system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Terror cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the blood bath and were executed four years ago.
Actually, this guy should have the death punishment before everyone else.
To let him live – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber who was in court.
He took up almost a decade of arrest, but eventually in January 2011 in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad, where US forces killed the former al-Qaida-Chef Osama bin Laden nearly four months later.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent said that secret service reports had given an indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southern Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't stand," said Corteen.
Until recently he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has caused other people.
The judgment took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is held with Memorials in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft (but do not conduct mobile conversations)
Flight travellers can now use their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and viewing films, but not call with the phone, so the new directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA employees Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The air carriers must demonstrate that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the flight staff training manuals and the arrangements for the spraying of equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA declared that it had already received plans from some airlines to enhance the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could very soon authorise the extended use of electronic devices," the FAA announced in announcement.
At present, passengers must disable smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may start it again only when the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and gives the captain green light.
When entering the landing, the passengers must turn them off again and may not start them again before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when starting, landing and rolling, the FAA explained.
Most of the new transport planes and other planes, which have been converted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi, should comply with the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional association of professional air carriers, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline – both sides will benefit from it”, commented Glading.
We are honestly sorry to feel like guardians in this topic.
However, Internet connections for browsing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometres continued to be banned, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in the flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble-like online game that the actress Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave publicly a jet of American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the flight.
And more severe devices such as laptops must continue to be conceived, as there is a danger of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile conversations during the flight are also continued to be prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone conversations is at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may prohibit certain electronic devices when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said from the Transport Security Authority National Transportation Safety Board, safety experts for national transport issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered as risks.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disturbances in navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disturb transmitters," says Rosenker.
An advisory committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA for the examination of this topic, recommended last month that the government authorise broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on the FAA has increased to reduce restrictions on use.
Critics like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid safety reasons for the ban.
The restrictions should also be more and more severe because the use of the equipment has become more widespread.
In some studies, the talk is that up to one third of the passengers forgets or ignores the shutdown of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices were known by passengers with UKW radios, which then represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interferences do not matter.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight height has been reached.
The airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences.
The majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic equipment generally produces much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-reader, for example, gives minimal radiation only when you reflect.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amason.com is one of the constituents of encouraging the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, company employees charged a passenger plane full of Kindle E-reader and made a test flight to find problems, but could not find out.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believes that the disturbance by the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there are only several reports from pilots speaking for an interruption of aircraft systems through the devices, most of which are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the shutdown of the devices by passengers in the case of instrument landing under bad visibility conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as reasonable adaptation for travellers that were now extensively equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in opposition to security”, said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rescued bird released by air rescue service by North Sea Bore Island
A bird flying to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea Bore Island, was released to the nature.
The water rack was fled last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was popped up by the Scottish animal protection organisation SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, Head of the Centre, said: “This water trail was probably a winter train bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds across the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird was seeking refuge on the drill island.
He added: "He could no longer fly on, so we were contacted with the request for help."
During their release, the water ring was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite willing to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was started in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in Great Britain want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov consulted over 1,000 leaders from the economy, which represent the sizes, sectors and regions of the UK.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the large majority of companies are exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU countries are stacking.
You wish to favour new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil from government side instead of stopping with the long and hard process of reforming the obscured EU institutions.
In their view, the majority of economic leaders believe that the control of these key competences should be recovered after Westminster, as regards certain subjects which are legally regulated – from cartel law to product legislation.
There was a general dissatisfaction on the internal market, as, according to the companies' statement, the costs of Brussels regulations would now overwhelm the advantages of being part of Europe's trade zone – even 40% of the large companies agreed to the most traditionally friendly Europe.
Finally, and that is most likely to say, our survey by economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards the change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on policy.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pressing for a "sinnable change" which brings the census of action back to Britain.
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion to the benefit of EU stay in a national vote at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for the EU membership.
It also shows that companies are expecting a significant shift in power conditions back to Britain from a new negotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fisheries union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom, as the result of our survey shows, which means a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas sauce
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Board.
"The present event is a milestone: the construction work at the Bulgarian section of the South Straam Gapeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the Chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the whole European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contractary dispute between Gazprom and its pendants in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk for conventional routes, as is officially heard.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" disabled.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream for favoured tariffs when the entire project is operating in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinated countries will begin on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is based on an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

According to Ulbrich, as sought by German industry, the view of the volume of the transaction shows.
In the first three quarters of this year, compared to the previous year section, it amounted to 31%.
In the United Kingdom, the plus was only 6%, in France 19%.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences related to children before 2011 claims against the child career Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children learned.
However, in the declaration of opening before the Commission, the YMCA had declared that in the organization “there has never been an incident of sexual child abuse.”
Managing director Phillip Hare was asked about one case in which a YMCA employee was accused of breach of child pornography, and another where a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was condemned in 1991 because of his abuse of intrusted children.
Hare said Gail Furness, a assistant lawyer from the Commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission had also been unprecedented in the claim that "the YMCA had carried out external audits, in which the YMCA was recognised as the front front in the field of child safety".
Instead, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that he received the second lowest evaluation of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Education Ministry) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management failed “from me downward” in the position of Lord and did not ensure that employees were clear about their obligations to report infringements against the directives on child safety.
Lord was sentenced for the YMCA during his two-year activity for sexual abuse to twelve boys at the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years of prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's infringements regarding the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed infringements, including that Lord was alone with children, she was privately serving as a babysitter, leaving her sitting on his shot, saying to one that he loved it, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose chief Lord was and asked for a training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the chief of child service Jacqui Barnat, who was the chief of Lords in the YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very insufficient”.
The Executive Director declared that he would not accept the statements of employees that they would not have been confident to submit their supervised report.
Instead, he said, they had affected their friendship with Lord, and they wouldn't have reported him.
Hare explained that he informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson the organisation has to draw from the "Jonathan-Lord-Interval" was "not reporting" by employees, and the board agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to press the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations occurred was taken by the manager of the children’s services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent the contamination of the evidence, but what had been "overreached" and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children between 2009 and 2011 when Jonathan Lord was busy, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, explained to the Commission.
He explained that there were serious problems in the establishment, review, inclusion, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was dismissed until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the chance of return as a British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his excursion from the Office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various internal policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided saying to British politics, and its comments are usually limited to foreign policy and its role as a messenger of the quarter of peacemakers in the Middle East.
On the question whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's Office, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard with the words: “Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this happens, so ...”
When the horse-saw experts found themselves in a group in Cardiff to cruise the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was in progress.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who wasn't even in the children's garden and made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee hit the three rounds more relaxed and picked the first price – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The unseparate couple, both the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition, which is organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set his plater hat in a freaking angle and led the two-year-old Toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural skills in dealing with the pony that is far above his age.
And Toffee received best-notes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practicing every day with Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great tension.”
They had to enter against the entire participant field and have gone from the place with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all enthusiastic when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has run horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was as electricized and everyone fired and clasped it.”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and even though he looked so small, he did a fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As he started, it will not take long until he is on the “Pferd of the Year” shed – and I am sure he will cut well.
A speaker of the annual horse view said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee afterwards how well they had beaten and presented in pre-führing.
They are watching good cooperation between pony and leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothing has contributed to its part, that really fits perfectly for the reason.
Chinese newspaper is to be "reformed" after calling
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been accused of differentiation, was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The New Express in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on TV that he accepted coupling money to falsify reports about a party company.
The new expression is now undergoing a comprehensive rectification, explained the regulatory authority.
The ‘Retification Order’ was received by the Press and Publications Authority, Radio, Film and TV in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unordered," announced the regulatory authority in a statement.
She said that it was decided to "do an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license".
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been commanded to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant officers at the New Express and to immediately check the lead team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported claimed financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion.
After he had been arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and put behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the whole news sector and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the state news broadcaster CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory.
I've become aware that I did wrong.
Following Chen's excuse, the New Express published an excuse on the front page and explained that it was failed to correctly check the reports.
Several well-known suspects have in recent times made confessions on TV.
Experts say that confessions are still being forced routinely, despite a legislative change in the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with own railway between the United States and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical railway operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities describe the 120 times 90 cm tunnel as one of the most faulty passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzack pattern over a length of almost six football fields, combines warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless insighted warehouses, which makes it easier to hide loaded trucks with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before unrecognised transport of drugs, the authorities explained.
In the detection of the tunnel, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured, according to the records of the Court.
Three men who, according to the authorities' statement, worked as drivers were charged for the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatening prison penalties between ten years and lifetime in the case of a claim of debt.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers put on a widely underground network of degradation channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartel the challenge of how to bring their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, governments found a nearly 640 metres long passenger with rails, travelling from a kitchen in a living house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr wants to go separate ways in the future.
But in an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
The actress Orlando Bloom expressed himself to separate from his wife, the top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which should be radiated on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "The life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope it."
Kerr and he loved himself still, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, in 2011 her son Flynn was born.
Veganism is, according to Lexika, subject to vegetarism, but it is very different from this in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of fermented places, ice or a strong edamer, these hamlets are not on the food map of a veganer.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the veganer leaves all consumption of animal products - also honey is denied.
What remains, you may wonder, but in closer consideration, the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a considerable incidence.
"Brotsites are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the present reform house, who has a variety of special products available for veganers.
Reuben Proctor is also pleased to visit the store in Domgasse.
For 13 years the negotiated New Zealand country has lived vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (fast) everything he needs to live. "I changed my diet in 1997 and became vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, then the next step took place and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of nutrition, but due to the choice of shoes," says Proctor, the art leather prefers normal leather.
He realized that it also goes to other everyday interests without animal products.
Firstly, vegan is a ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," says Proctor the maxima of the Veganer, which extends to all consumption behavior.
Instead of trusting citizens, roaring eggs or rubber bears, the Vegan quickly discovered all new products that increased the enthusiasm.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan is not a failure, no ashes, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that the nutritional conversion reduces the choice of food options, proctor rather relies on the power of custom.
And precisely these conditions also allowed some to fail so well meant attempts.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," says Proctor a comparison.
And turns in: "Certain tastes are not attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make the taste.
"You can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
For example, Proctor brings Auberginen, Champignons and a few Vegan sausages to a grill festival.
He is paying attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it is also supposed to taste deficitly.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce to animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disturbances, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased percentage of vitamins.
There are high-performance athletes who only feed vegan.
"My blood levels are best, I'll be often checked," says Proctor.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"When animals are nutrient with feed instead of weeding on the weed, it is a question whether in the meat that is bought in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 share is high," says Proctor.
For Veganer it also gives the possibility to take the coenzy in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he explains.
Broad ways do not need to go proctor for food supply.
Finally, there are basic nutrients everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find on the spot.
Just sometimes I'm buying something special.
"Many people are overlooking that only the finished products are expensive, but that is what is known in "usual" finished products".
Without prejudice, the preparation of vegan courts is far more favourable and less time-limited than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small knives you can get good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cheeks, Proctor could also bring his swear parents to the astonishment.
Family festivals give the veganer a new spice.
It has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was already faced with skepsis.
Don't you taste my food anymore?
"Shall I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions, you have to act as a vegan with finger-spits feeling.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor does not want to deadline an enklavendasa.
And more precisely, then the daily world does not appear as veganly as suspected - and the veganer is not as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many dancers offer Falafels, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he extends to pasta courts, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to work on it.
"When I started feeding me vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealand countries can find out a development: "You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it."
"If there are enough demands, they may be inclined to supplement the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the comb in Mannheim or the café bird free.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants should have at least a vegan dishe on the food card.
In fact, vegane courts are there for all.
Everyone can eat it, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Flesh courts, however, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the largest part of the past impossible," says Proctor.
But the purchase of vegan products may be a little difficult at the beginning.
In particular, if you learn to understand that in earthnuts also can contain animal additives as a colouring agent, you seem to leave the courage quickly by following the ethics in so many obstacles and falls.
Not only therefore, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explain the many ingredients, which are added to food, but also cleansing.
"After and after, you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to observe "It is sometimes better to do small steps than standing or stubbling," white proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes the consciousness.
He may not fully manage his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to breathe its customers.
Trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other 11 US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pounds in the exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indexes had not been calculated for an hour for errors in data transport.
In August this year there had been two pounds in one week alone.
First of all, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively defective purchases to the options markets for technical problems.
After that, the exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and stretch the orders.
Two days later, half of the whole stock trade in the United States came for several hours because of a computer pane on the Nasdaq exchange.
In addition, for watching, the last year of Facebook's exchanges had been carried out.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales contracts, later fixed the SEC stock exchange oversight, and the company made a record penalty of $10 million.
Constance: Radler runs 63-year-olds
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night, at 22 o'clock, was on the left side of the train station to the market.
As a 63 - year - old man suddenly walked from a local to the road, the bike driver, according to the police, could no longer brake in time.
During the next collapse, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and pulled up about 15 inches long seed on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to the medical treatment to the clinic.
British Police Assange is giving a delivery certificate
Today, the British police have sent a delivery notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a “request to stand” which invited him to appear in a police guard and added that he should not comply with it, threatening him to arrest.
Assange threatens the delivery to Sweden because of the complaint in a sexual offence after its possibilities have been exhausted by British law since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to the issue at the beginning of the month.
As he feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the US, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "a 40-year-old man called on to put himself at a police guard at one of us chosen time," explained one speaker.
He continues to injure the conditions of his release to security.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that it is delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible spionage claims after publishing more than 250 000 diplomatic news on the envelope website WikiLeaks.
Driving with 210 km/h and hot drinks between the legs will receive 1,000 £ punishment
A driver was charged a punishment of 1,000 pounds because he had driven with up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Without the necessary care and attention, Howie became guilty of the Court of Justice of Colchester.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also condemned for the payment of costs of 90 pounds and a sacrifice grant of 100 pounds.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has temporarily calculated the CGT measure, but it is still waiting for the final decision by tax officer George Osborne, who had charged a 7% stamp tax in 2012 on apartments costing more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers, who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, the revenues from the tax on residence tax in the districts Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in 2012/13, have been collected for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in the tax on high prices and the introduction of the associated legislation against a circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low, regardless of the effects of the obsolete community tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more stumbling on the purchase of property in London, or stop owners from selling it," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at price – in the prosperous southwestern belt of London, which ranges from Fulham to Wimbledon, has spent the record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed an even annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by a rising ‘inland market’, where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced a upward trend, such as Savills.
Scientists were able to throw more light on the context of a dog's doughnowledge with his mood.
Earlier research had shown that happy dogs with the cock whipped more to the right (from the view of the dog), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can see and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: “In humans, the left and right brain half responds differently to stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain was responsible for the movement of the left side and reversed, and that the two hemisphere played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs responded to the sides of their species, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analysed the behaviour.
Soon we'll probably understand why the pie moves into the one, once to the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a naturally reliable version or a silhouette to eliminate other aspects, and so we could control the movement of the cock more left or right.”
When the animals saw how otherwise an unexpressed dog moved the tail to the right (from the perspective of the wreckling dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, if the swinging was mainly left (more from the perspective of the dog, who wealthys), then their heart rate increased and they looked distressed.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Instead, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should worry and when they should not.
He said: “If you have various meetings with other dogs and the betting with the cock is rather linked with friendly behavior and the right hand produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help to improve the understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and guest adolescent at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol, explained that this had not been the first study that was investigated whether left and right for dogs was important.
Last year a team of Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if it is a happy dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria, Canada, said: “Hounds are rather going to a robot dog when his ,switching' turns to the left and not to the right rather than to become unhappy – just differently than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study, like dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he explained.
“There are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halfs are used for different purposes, but many of the details need to be determined – and dogs do not constitute an exception," Bradshaw says.
However, since their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the cock sometimes moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.

In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys announced: "After the decision to cancel the show in the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and to the medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show in the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November."
"On Alex Turner, a throat ignition was diagnosed, so he cannot occur."
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was moved in the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.

Pope Franziskus appointed first cardinals in February
Pope Franziskus is first called new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergymen in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Franziskus will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the choice of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer participate in the pope election – this is the case of a group of 120 ‘elective cardinals’.
In a statement in which the message was published, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican speaker, said that there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony is held for the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as the consistory.
"Papst Franziskus has decided to make his decision to call the consistory in advance in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of electoral cardinals will probably be lowered until February.
He explained that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary to resume the number of electoral cardinals 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The conservation of the next year is therefore important because it is the first since the election of Franziskus in March this year, says Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on the sides of Europe, particularly Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the training of the Cardinals Council founded by Franziskus, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task to find opportunities to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Franziskus has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was “good possible” that Franziskus asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far, we weren't in this position – that's all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would call to cardinals, but Franziskus puts “full of surprises – so we don't know who he is appointing".
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat lounge
General Motors calls back nearly 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup trucks with the 2014 construction year in order to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat loan, so a communication from the US Regulatory Authority for Vehicle Safety on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for reseting the front seat loans.
For this reason they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety in head support.
“When the vehicle is driven from the back to the vehicle, it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the inmates, so that there is an increased risk of injury”, was read in the message on the National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models called back were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the main model start of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owner in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdowns, which had a negative impact on the sale of cars in October.
The sale of silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM explained on Friday.
In October GM sold 42.660 silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 per cent on the New York exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Despairing a Obama chooser
I chose President Obama twice in the hope that change would be possible
He says that Obama has made praiseful efforts that have been destroyed by the blockadetics of the Republicans
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drones attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at the Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terrible sad book.
It's a book of which I believed it would warm me up during the dirty second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and describes the Memoirs Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient descriptions in the evening and go to bed, the book leads me back to a time when the politics inspired millions and could rob the breath.
The election became a earthquake and the newsspeaker held in mind the historical importance of this hour.
My classmates cried for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama then switched to office in 2008, he had 82% consent values.
And then I'll close the book.
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening, as if you were screwed out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vain reminder, a sad reminder of missing possibilities.
In the years since I first gave my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could've imagined.
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has accomplished from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military departure from Iraq, the end of the forced diversity of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama is Ladens.
I also believe that the party-political blockadetics have broken too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay in order to mention just a few.
But after I have defended the Obama Government countless times against colleagues and familiars, I ended with my explanation attempts.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade politics cannot explain why they are allowed to listen to foreign heads or kill innocent children through drones in the overseas world.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished, which reveals state misbehavior.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. national, was murdered without procedures, nor why the public financing and expenditure limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report in which it states that the efforts of the White House to rest the media are the 'agresivest' since the Nixon Government.
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood when I was 18 years old that government work could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the parliamentary office is not a predictable course, since a opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Massacher are the public discussion.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that's most disturbing me.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidateship.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unextruded alternative, he seemed not to be able to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope of which we have heard so long.
However, with the decline of the consent values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become so harder.
It raises my desire for the many promises that have dissolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in the preselections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electorates after the decision, he told his employees to come back to course and follow the purpose of their matter.
“I want us to find our magic,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionary and Member Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters were pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnet, which is in a judicial debate on the payment of 6 million dollars to CO2 taxes, raised the claim when he wanted to wash questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
"He is in a major conflict of interest in paid parental leave, for when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives vacation or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral Commission, Palmer, with 53 votes, officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a review of the process of voting so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we have no system where you march into which you enter the data into a computer, select immediately and then have the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the voting list.
Do you use it because then you can erase the results if they don't like you?
It is incredible to vote with pencils today.
The electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic choice and recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy belongs to an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office "very serious".
A public office is about public service.
"We are pursuing no reward except that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this Community," he said.
RBS suspends two devisors
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its devising department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government detection of the disgusting manipulations on the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with the authorities in the world's largest financial market, where 5.3 billion dollars per day change the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the expanding investigation, which the scandal attracts around the Libor interbanking transaction.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we are working fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now supposed to have been advocated by his current position as a European leader of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was awarded this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were concealed with any misbehavior.
Bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup were members of the Usher Instant Message Group, saying the situation nearby people.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss Regulatory Authority had declared Finma that she had examined a discreet manipulation of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently concerned with claims that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPM Organ and Credit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said with the situation familiar persons.
Banks get through Instant Messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misbehavior.
The news about these investigations has put the dealers in an upholstered area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculates.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affairs and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and high-grade liquid exchange market, but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume of exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms through banks leads to “the market can be influenced with very low ticket prices”.
The message came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that this week she cancelled a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is stopped”, explained Credit Suisse.
Painted the bauzaun on the Bechtle foundation
A group of citizens' initiative "Swisser Wiese" has delighted the construction sauna on the Bechtle foundation at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footway, says in a press release.
The planned coverage of the falling house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons because the ground threatens to rip off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had dealt with the BI with his colleague Reinhard Domke.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message with the message "We have been applied to it".
This, however, disturbed the about 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was called "We are against building ruins".
This would point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss wheat - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passengers before the "building" it was clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city's project will be much better, although not few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city delays these answers, it says from the sides of the BI.
As it was heard, the public statements of the mayor also have effect.
In May, at the Municipal Council meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bath and wellness complex on the Swiss wheat.
Some seem just to be scared, others feel that they are "plump depression attempt" on the population, says the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte für Schiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfactory Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Federalliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed the sports director of the "Bullen" by the arbitrators.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of sulphur kings," he took the two open whirlpools on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
The recent reason for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against greyy on the last Sunday, where the Senegalese became an alleged actuatory of disaster - which certainly was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A cruel wrong decision", said Rangnick, who called arbitrator Harkam "overreached".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
His German countryman decided: "I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in every situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the sharmützel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old stressed.
But in view of the success, ranknick agreed to a praise shymne.
"There are only two words for that: Right well," he stated.
There isn't much deferred.
Especially the way the crew plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on that way.
Frame changes in winter transfer time will hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Besides a player comes with the wish he wants to leave the club," ranknick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the government of Obama: The US Supreme Court today decided that the closely linked health law with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to conclude a health insurance or to pay a penalty until 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the State’s tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts hit the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the comprehensive law and also held that the requirement of the health law that states would either need to extend the conditions of access to medicine or otherwise to be deleted from all state aids would not be constitutionally restrictive.
The proceedings against the law had been enforced by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidency candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-elective battle.
Norway: Norwegian place makes itself with giant mirrors light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunfall, the rhythm located in the Westfjord valley usually declines from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors in 45 metres height, a century dream was true on Wednesday.
"At the end!", mayor Steinar Bergland swarmed at the start ceremony in the TV2 broadcaster.
Some inhabitants of the valley set up sunsets, others set up half-security sunglasses.
So far, in the winter, sunshine had to ride with a rope to a nearest summit.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to link the rays with mirrors to the valley.
But this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After a multiannual debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (approximately 615 000 euro) expensive project.
A similar construction has produced the Italian Alps town of Viganella winter sunshine for a few years.
Post is hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday lecture are still on various letter boxes of the core city and the parts of the city, but if you read the small printed at the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find that the emptying of sun and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP declares.
A request from the FDP confirmed that.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the postal building in the Ernst-Ludwig-strate 36 and in the Jakob-Müller-strate 1 is empty in Hüttenfeld.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten are also deleted on Sunday, the answer to the FDP question is not answered.
The social and youth policy speaker of the FDP, Fritz Rörenbeck, wants to hook here.
The Sunday lecture is an important post service at the date post.
"This is radically and indispensable in this business despite the increase in prices for letters on January 2013."
Thomas Bittner, political and urban president of the Liberals, supports his colleagues: "What is annoying me is the fact that the clearing periods are changed or deleted here in secret."
The post is located in the area of the city nearby.
"The letter boxes in the New Castle and Rosengarten sections must at least be deleted on Sunday," says Bittner and Rörenbeck unisono.
Also, for the core city, especially not mobile fellow citizens, a letter box with Sunday lecture would have to be able to reach footnote.
In the city parliament, Röhrenbeck asked whether the city administration was planning to discuss this matter with the post.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But his knowledge also gives a Sunday lecture in Hofheim.
Their party has indeed spoken for privateization.
"Then decisions are made in other places," said Maier.
Frankfurt Park fees are to increase strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be more expensive.
The magistrate of the city advises this morning on a presentation of the transport desk Stefan Majer (Green).
Therefore, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
For this, however, prices should not be reduced, but the interval of parking clocks and parking tickets should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
Then, in December, the Municipal Assembly has to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Retail Committee believes that this is not a good idea.
The possibility of parking directly before the business is "a not too underestimative advantage for smaller traders".
The German transport club believes that an increase after two decades is "reasonable and actually overdue".
Public transport also becomes more expensive.
Happy Actions Overcome Hosts
With a narrow frame, the Gentlemen I of the TSV joy town in the Schiller school hall in Reutlingen had to enter against the TG Gönningen from the Swibian Alb.
Although the applers were with an experienced team on the other side.
Soon, however, it appeared that they, even older, could not fully support the rapid actions of the city of joy.
With the hard and ranked strikes, the Gönninger made very difficult.
Repeatedly they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network centre and were not at the block defense place.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the city of joy in all interests.
In view of this depressing and play-determining performance, the third sentence was then slightly lazy and lustless to the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, who has been able to make it clear in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bauerle, Yannik Büchele, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn, the second teams from Baiersbronn and the city of joy were faced.
They delivered a hard-fighted two-hour battle.
Nervosity on both sides caused mainly errors and point gifts in the ball-administration; even in the passports, the precision was sometimes lacking, and in some critical games, the overseer prevented the view of possible point gains.
In this highly balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto’s TSV team voted, however, through the great physical use and a delightful commitment of both teams.
Maintenance day at the small English cabin
In the meantime, a group of engaged participants met at the small English hut in Ibach for the fifth day of care following the Upper Hotzenwald Natura 2000 project.
As a result of suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the hut of view should be cut off into the valley, says Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, so Caesar, described this area as the glossy piece of the slope, on which the landscape offered the ideal framework for wonderful views.
He thanked the attendee for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the care day was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the relationship between human and natural.
He offered every citizen the opportunity to put its own accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Protection of the Government Presidium Freiburg, following the greeting by the Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the screening and wished the action a good success.
The tourist goal of the wide view covers, according to Tribukait, the goal of maintaining the old, grown almenic field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing weeds.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grass jumps cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free compounds for the conservation of species.
Tribukait said that she would not want to fail in this place to break a lens for the planned biosphere area.
This plan does not include the current measure only narrowly.
A biosphere area also provided the possibility of sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous complement of the future achieved with the life project and the past care days.
Following these various statements, district leader Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers in groups.
The larger trees had already been struck before, the forest trailer was ready to pick up.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of wacholder bushes and the care of a dry stone locker.
The objective was the free view at the point of view.
Löfving: buyers still only candidates
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstadtchen Löfving with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future school, child, youth and senior policy, as well as its own city works can be called attractive, no second citizen's citizen's candidate has yet reported itself.
As the only candidate for the succession of Norbert Brugger's citizen for age reasons no longer candidate, the 46-year-old bank purchaser and operator Dieter Köpfler from Löffen has been established.
The application period will expire on Monday, 11 November, at 18 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei charged for Nortel patents
The group, which has thousands of previous Nortel patents, struck a lawyer of complaints on Thursday for patent infringements against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that was excessed by Nortel during the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that the Nortel patents had bought for $4.5 billion, complained Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the community ownership of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is injured in seven cases of patent injury.
Patents have technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, so the complaint that hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC create mobile phones working with Google operating system Android, which stands in sharp competition to the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google gave a initial offer of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased his offer several times and offered last 4.4 billion US dollars.
After the Nortel Patents of Rockstar were offered, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12,5 billion, a business that was also motivated to patent part of Motorola's library.
“Even though Google failed with his attempt to acquire the prosecutor at the auction, Google hurt the patents and continues to do this”, the complaint says.
Rockstar demands a high damage replacement from Google, as it claims that Google's patent injury is deliberately, so the accusation.
Egypt denies the first freely elected President
Mohammed Mursi puts off the office, but his day of triumph is not supposed to mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was defended as the first freely elected president of the country and thus entered the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been disposed of 16 months earlier.
Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of State since the monarchy crashed about 60 years ago.
He put the oath in front of the 18 black robes dressed judges of the court, which has his seat at the Nile and has been impressed with an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," Mursi said at the celebration of ceremony that live was transmitted in state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability”, said the 60-year-old Mursi, a engineer and member of the Muslim brotherhood in the United States, a fundamentalist group who had been mostly taken as a prohibited organization by the respective government since its foundation 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building when Mursi arrived shortly after 11 o'clock in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred trailers had gathered before the court to congratulate the new president, and, in contrast to the presidency prunk from the Mubarak time, the traffic was stopped only in a short time so that the autoconvoy could cross the normally live road that connects the city centre with the southern prestede.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the brotherhood, his personal priest has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the efforts of the rebellion from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak target.
"Egypten is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," the Mursi dressed in a blue clothing with red scratch declared the judges in the cabinet chamber in which he placed the office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to hold his approach.
He was officially welcomed by a army chapel that played the National Hymne he listened to in Habaignition.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people at the largest hearing hall of the university with speakers of "The Army and the People are a Hand".
The University of Cairo, established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a University of Islamist students in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi put a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the rebellion, which last year led to the end of the authoritarian rulership of Mubaraks, and he promised to require presidential powers which the military council had taken over by the Head of State hunted from the Office.
However, with the official oath put before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he bows on the will of the military, which points out that the battle of power will continue.
Mursis Speaking on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populistic gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has started.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on Saturday night, it continues with an Ü 25 party.
Bold beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers, of course, in both days.
Workers crashed by ladders: severe injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder and hurt himself severely.
The man from Lamp Right Houses wanted to exchange a defective heater at the outer facade of a guesthouse.
When he stepped on the ladder attached to the roof, this shot away and the man crashed on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to the Salzburg National Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Violents in South Africa: twice lifelong prison
Nine months after the brutal rape and condemnation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the actor has been sentenced to twice a lifetime on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC transmitter.
The victim later died by the consequences of severe injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty in the beginning of the week of crime.
The act had triggered disturbance across the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in a industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town in February.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but forfeited.
The sight of the youths was so disgusting that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
During the process, Kana had admitted to have been in a bar with Booysen in the real night.
He also admitted to have struck and raped them, but he refused to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had first gone out of several offenders, but two suspiciouss left prison because the evidence against them was not enough.
The lawyer also stressed during the procedure that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Violations in South Africa are almost one of the everyday lives: Annually there are about 64 000 ads for sexual violence.
These are almost ten times as many as in Germany, but with 82 million people have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the dark numbers in sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest Shinken
Jumbo searched for the "best shinking of the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" the Pro7 Star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker is evident at the beginning: The most important thing for the shink is the swine cooks, Turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can shinks that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as the chief of the large schinkenfabrik in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains how the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany loved shinks", as Jumbo announces the black forest shinks.
Only with hair protection and kittel, he comes into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo must also disinfect his hands for the first time before he can take the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening at Quickimbiss in Forest Shut
"Here is working for me roaring amounts," the TV makers, black forest shinks as a mass product are amazed.
16.000 chores a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat, colour: Uli explains what it is about quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the phenomenon of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"I am excited when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then," said Jumbo cynically.
The level of private television in reinculture is presented here.
But it's worth watching anyway.
The viewer sees that the destruction of the choles continues to be handwork.
Because: Black forest shinks are traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of the shink is the spice mix with the salt.
Smoking storm and smoking fire reminds Jumbo optically of a "U-Boot".
The Trick: Tunnel branches provide here in the smoke for the special taste of the black forest shinken.
20 days in the smoke make the shinks almost black.
"Now the disc is disappearing in the Jumbo," he announces the test dilution.
"There's really delicious," says the Fazit of the TV star.
This will enable all stakeholders to live.
You thought travel offices belonged to the internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record income from vacation in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travelling company is now going on a cleaned annual profit from taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared with $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are achieved, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to record gain of 290.4 million dollars in the 2011/12 period.
As director Graham Turner announced, in the first half of the year, Flight Centre gained eight percent and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
“We have been profitable since the beginning of our ten countries and some of them are in good ways towards record year revenues before interests and taxes”, he explained.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest results.
In Australia the recreational industry has recovered in the second half of the year, balancing a slightly weaker market for business travels.
Similarly, it went for the leisure business of Flight Centre in Great Britain, while here the business customers were less spending.
The U.S. business recovered against the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit is expected for the third year as a result for the whole year.
The shares of the Flight Centre rose at 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are stopped to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses to English literature, students must treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic Lyrik and contemporary British Romans from 1914.
The examination also contains “unseen texts” intake to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is dismissed.
From 2015 onwards, students have to submit a separate GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new teaching plans for English and mathematics – the first factors that have been radically transformed.
Other core vessels will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Supervisory Authority for Examination, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new use system and less course work.
In one speech in the summer, Minister for Education, Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus that we need to reform our testing system in order to restore public confidence” and he stressed that GCSEs would be“coming more challenging, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent for mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hourly plan, it is said from coalition circles that the comprehensive mathematics test – combined with a stronger weighting of the field in rank lists – is likely to encourage schools to use more hours.
The training plan focuses more on ‘problems from the right life’, including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious towers attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and color strokes present the circuit performance view this weekend in the city house.
The evaluations have already been made on Thursday
Again, the local association W514 sets out this great exhibition.
Builders of the associations in the district of Soest show here their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges carried out the evaluation of the many rabbits and were able to make outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show are best informed as the assessment of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition takes Mayor Hermann Arndt Saturday at 14.30 a.m.
For all visitors, the rabbit view is already open on Saturday 10 p.m. and on Sundays from 10 p.m. to 15.30 p.m., with which the victory is attached.
The guests are also invited to a coated Tombola and to a delicious cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Economy Forum
At the next Economy Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, it is the subject of "To hell with hell - theological considerations about today's dealing with the last things".
Referent is professor Johanna Rahner.
The Economy Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical church communities of Salem, the castle of Salem and the Culture Office of the Soil Sea.
Johanna Rahner wants to examine the question in the forum, how today people are graduating the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries knew too much about it and put on those pictures of heaven and hell, "which are our ideas up to this day," the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of completion is rather characterized by a certain embarrassment or even languagelessness.
"The greater hope has been exaggerated by the religious criticism," says the referent.
They have provided us with so many question marks that the calling marks seem to have come away.
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the angry of death."
This is linked to the question of that desire, "which dreams that everything may be good at the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
In 1997 she promoted Dr. theol, also in Freiburg.
The habilitation of fundamental theology and economic theology followed in 2003 at the West Falish Wilhelms University.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has entered a chair for systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Girls: More than 100 young Catholics from the Little Heuberg confirm their faith confession in the firming
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths have been firmed at the Small Heuberg.
In the morning, the group was accompanied by Laudato-Si, the afternoon of the Youth Chor The Spirit.
When the company was received, the youths said yes to their baptism and offered the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner, the firms had prepared themselves for the great celebration of many municipal members.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and experienced the youth day in Submachtal together.
Illmensee: Second Mountainbike race enthusiastic participants
On beautiful weather, 214 bicycle drivers came to Illmensee to handle the round course across the hill chains around the lake.
This informs Ulrich Knobel from the organised sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance of over 15 kilometers and 300 metres of height, were also many hobby cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a contest atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German peak class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places at the German masterships.
These two were expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time forward to the goal and defend his title as a total victory of the short distance.
On place two, Pascal was able to place himself faithfully again.
With the ladies, Theresa Duelli from the team of nightmares was able to win the victory trail at the top.
On place two and three, Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A happy development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole bandwidth was represented by athletes.
The age structure also reached from ten years in the youngest to more than 70 years in the oldest launchers.
In the main race this year, more absolute topathlets were at the start.
Four drivers were able to stop from the regional top drivers.
Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-profi from the Black-Tusk racing team.
Pangerl, with a teammate, was already two times world champion in 12-hour walks.
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German master titles in Duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 metres of height, there was a revolving final in the target inlet before the three-sea hole.
Pangerl rushed first over the target line.
Only a second behind it, the routine Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the total assessment.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as a third of the total assessment.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place secured Areane Blersch from Binzwangen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sporters and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the Western African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the top 10 of the “CNN Heroes of 2013”.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to “CNN Hero of the Year”.
The winner receives $250.000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle saw his sick father always lose awareness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation that expanded into his brain and there caused a haematom that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurochirurgs in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overfilled hospitals and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it's not the first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed since Bwelles' father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, so the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a physician for 413 people.
But even if there is a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not visit them.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty limit and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered, in Bwelle, the decision was matured to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, traveling in rural areas on weekends and offering free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday he and up to 30 people in small buses and ride with the broken medical equipment on the roof over unfixed terrain to the villages that need help.
Everything's not always going smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and muds.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, song and dance, and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebration and bwelling – with its wide smiles and its unlimited energy – is happy to attend the joyful celebration.
The next morning the team then begins with the study of hundreds of patients.
“Pro ride we treat 500 people”, says Bwelle.
They come from a circuit of 60 kilometers around the village – and this to walk.
Each of these weekend hospitals offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, underernähring, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crowns, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local death.
The surgery usually takes place in a school, the council or a apartment; after the intervention the patients stand up and go to the recreational area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is eaten by the group's generator, so Bwelle and its volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an effortful pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night, so we can stay alert and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then goes back to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free surgery in the last year and knows that with her work it produces a huge difference for the people they help.
One man explained that the free surgery of a performance break that he received now allowed him to work again.
"That changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend hospitals and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private hospitals in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, so Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who's studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and voluntarily cooperating in Bwelles' group.
He is always either in the hospital or is trying to make money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gather practical experiences that they would never get at home.
“We can be at surgery where we help to drop blood or to hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle”, explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring often spent sanitary material.
However, if they are only in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instructions.
"He is without doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life of this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people does not know any limits.
For Bwelle, nearly constant work is not a burden.
To help others with a happier life and thus fulfill a promise given to his Father brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laugh and to relief the pain.

Excellence in battle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut on the body of Horst Janson.
Janson is even an old hat in his meteoric, the actory art.
The old man Santiago can't pretend anything when fishing.
That's how the two just complement great.
They almost think they can see the folds in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman's young man is talking about.
When Santiago is tired of life bending on the chair, it's true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellently masters.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and eventually wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his willingness.
Janson is on the stage in wide distances as an individual.
He is able to focus the audience on himself, so his monologue is not a moment of boring.
Its efforts to draw the fish at the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea consists only of blue lighted water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the Fischerdorf.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in light: the cabin of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sing with her songs and her glorious voice the sense of life of Kubas.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythmus and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Decline to the Romans
At approximately 120 meters of length, a sewage canal from the Roman time is obtained below Cologne.
Anyone who visits Cologne won't pass the dome.
About 157 meters, the two towers are in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigrants of church towers, believe that there is also a lot to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is a expert in things Kölner underworld.
Meeting point for its leaders is the Cologne tourism service centre directly at the Dom.
The round begins very unspectacular: "We start in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted an auto-right city, and therefore the rest of the old city walls only remained that which was not too large.
Therefore, most users of the parking house are going to pass by the Roman remains today and only put their car off.
But whoever looks more closely, in the park deck D2 finds an archaeological foundation separated by metal grids.
It is seen about five meters of ruins of handtellers of stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze leaves the participants on the upper park level to throw another look into a dark, 15 meters deep box.
This is the well of the old Domain, which unfortunately is hardly observed.
The next station of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants go down to the depth.
We experience here the office of the once mighty man north of the Alps, the CCAA presidency.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "Stadt of Roman law and city of the Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for Emperor Culture".
And the pretorium is the former governor palace, the power center of the Roman Empire at the Rhine.
From the premises of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewage channel, which has been given here at about 120 meters of length.
"You can walk quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers the guests.
A surprise still has schoolze.
After picking the key on the box, he leads the group to a 16 meters depth, accomplishable tray.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bathroom," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bathroom deep into the ground to come to the ground water that was essential for the ritual washing.
Until now, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins fall to the eighth century, different water levels can be seen by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archaeological zone on the councilhouse site for which the construction work is to begin soon.
However, until completion, a few years will pass.
Bene nearly hacked off: Relay of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment will be re-rolled after over four years.
A process of attempted death, dangerous body injury and damage to two 30-year-olds began before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants are silent to the entrance.
They were supposed to have been active in the Rockers scene and then belonged to the Bandidos.
In June 2009, the prosecutor suggests that they, together with unknown complications in Finovfurt, have stuck and hit three men in a car.
All the victims were severely hurt, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims should have heard of the competing grouping of Hell's Angels.
One is supposed to have been a high-level member from Berlin.
Previously, a chase of persecution with several cars was evident.
According to the accusation, it was about district fighting and a power demonstration.
The two complainants had been released in an initial procedure at the beginning of 2012.
A court speaker then said that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feather.
The actors had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof suspended the judgment following the revision of the State Prosecutor and rejected it to the Landgericht for reconciliation.
One of the accused is currently in an open execution because of another infringement.
The entrance was mainly about the reconstruction of the operations in the real night.
As a witness, the detective Commissioner was charged.
In the centre, mobile conversations were held by the accused and other people who had heard the police.
It is difficult that Rocker is almost always adhering to a law for them - and not saying.
This is also true of the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had extracted.
At the request of the prosecutor Stefan Golfier said that there have been new traces since the last procedure.
For the process, 11 further negotiations are set.
The rejection society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but sometime it's going home.
Only: In the buildings of people on the front and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Clearly, some cocktail or sect may be responsible for it!
What is closer than riding chilled to the next drive-in to enjoy a small thing?
I admit, I like to join you when it goes to fast-food holes at late night or early morning.
A few pommes, a cola, a Burger - and then nothing like off home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangers are noticeable.
Because what must be missing that you throw your fast-food bags out of the car window with steady regularity?!
Especially on weekends, thrown paper bags are on street edges and parking lots.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags with home and to the next trash?
It isn't just that the paperware disperses the landscape.
Carpets have also covered transport facilities such as guide planks and thus caused accidents.
However, it does not even know what this word really means.
When you're on your way more often in the evening, just with several people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after perforated nights: clothes, bottles and other waste are towering there.
There would be a few bags more or less - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to go to the food residues of others.
I see the day when the cities and communities are going to be stupid - and the fast-food chains must demand for their bags pand.
Obama's withdrawal in health policy
According to severe criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday at his frequently repeated, clear promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a cancellation letter, the Republicans sent to the President in the last days that he deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relatived his original promise.
"The majority of the citizens who have a working health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the cancellations, Obama called on the Americans who received such communications to review a new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more favourable than expected.
"They come a better offer," he said.
The government called it a little surprising that the five percent of the population who have completed a insurance itself would have to look at another tariff because their contract does not meet the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act.
“I would like to say directly to these Americans that they deserve better,” said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Representative House in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, explained that the start of the online platform has been “mistable” since October.
“I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I'm determined to recover your trust.
This statement of Sebelius to a consultant sitting behind her at the yesterday hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with the Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed with the question why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refrain from a Stately promoted insurance to conclude a tax on HealthCare.gov which they now want to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm an attack on Syrian Air Force Base
A U.S. official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed to CNN on Thursday that Israeli battle planes would have attacked an air weapon support in Syrian Latakia one day before.
The goal was "raketes and related equipment", of which the Israeli government feared that they were intended for the Lebanese Hisbollah, said CNN.
Syrian and Libanesian media as well as the Arab transmitter Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the foundation in the Harbour City of Latakia was shot in the night from Wednesday on Thursday, and the Israelites were responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base point in Latakia, where Russian defense missiles of type S-125 Newa were seen as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, according to which channel 2 has a range of 35 kilometers and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilos.
Insecure The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes an anonymous Israeli government official with the words that he believes that Israel carried out the attack, but is not sure.
In any case, a speaker of the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports".
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the day newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, partly successful, to deliver ground air raketes to hisbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt of Syria to provide hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a "red line" which would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented confession that the US spy has “inappropriately gone too far”
John Kerry, with an unexpected consent, pointed out that the United States' absurd attitude toward its monitoring programmes was “inappropriately far too wide” in certain cases.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, deceived the responsibility for being switched to “autopilot” when the explosive explosions of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the spy activities of the NSA.
Through the information the US government has run into a diplomatic storm of dismantling from the side of its allies.
In a video-connected speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "The President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned about some things that have run quasi per autopilot, simply because the ability was to do what was going on the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course to 11 September."
He then agreed as the first high-level member of the U.S. government that the US spionage had exceeded a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases this has gone too far."
The President is determined to clarify and therefore carry out a thorough investigation so that nobody must feel that there is abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not affected in this process.
Kerry, however, claimed that the NSA was a power of good and had been saved many lives by its monitoring operations.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is inspired of killing people, blowing into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to capture and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
In the meantime, US-American legislators will travel to Europe to disrupt the concerns against the alleged American spy and convince the Europeans to continue to cooperate with the United States in anti-terror efforts, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs explained on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and was concerned about their threats to stop taking part in anti-terror organisations because of the frustration of the monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board in our common efforts to combat terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first to sit in the Senate as a Democrat and acts as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I go to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their concerns about the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have stressed relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the Secret Service this week declared that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures quoted from documents issued by Snowden, which the NSA has monitored the phone of Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel and up to 34 other Heads of State worldwide.
The Head of National Secret Services, James Clapper, defended the spionage of allies as necessary and declared that this was customary on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said that his authority prepared the journey of the convention to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of other participants are to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being developed.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "reasonable words".
He said that the European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of spy programs they used for many years.
"We can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also be able to find out that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy says.
At the same time, for John Kerry a trip to the Middle East and Poland in the weekend to deal with the wrestling of the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
A tough injury at the jumping gelenk threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Federal League outdoor game of FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg.
Mainz asks for the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the crew.
So far, he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his short-term effort," said Trainer Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best gatekeepers with six hits.
Because the Mainzers must already refrain from the injured performance of Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartling and Niko Bungert.
Australier is proclamating against prison in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced in Phuket to 15 days in prison because she had falsely claimed to be raped by a taxi driver, has sentences against the judgment and was released to security.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty of a Province Court in Phuket on 15 June, having made a false statement after she had stated to the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men arrested them.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had come to her hotel safely after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she admitted to think about the story.
Until the judicial proceedings, she was locally in police guardians.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison in a low-security prison at the edge of Phukets instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy-Liga, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted her back to Australia.
“We are naturally worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has sentenced against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on free foot.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime in the holiday town of Krabi in southern Thailand it is taking holidays.
On the side of the court was to hear Bamford be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand may be endeavored to improve its attacked tourist image after the recent murder of Michelle Smith's Travel Buyer in Phuket, and that is why it comes to a free speech.
