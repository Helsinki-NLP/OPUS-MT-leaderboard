What is it to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort or the "Conditory".
The new councillors of the capital of the series of ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the urban representation at all.
The Actuálně.cz newspaper has been a few members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as it has ruled the notorical serpent, which has been born in the past years in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the ruder.
The codated vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the released era of Supreme Citizen Pavel Bém, has been rejected by some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed that the new councils in terms of these new terms were slightly dark.
At least they claim that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a new one in Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new Chairman of Culture, reacted to the test of the "Paten-Wortskatte".
But also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present me here, which I use occasionally."
"Otherwise, I don't like a snake."
From the vocabulary published by the Actuálně.cz in this year's June before the ODS election convention, the editorial work picked out six terms, especially those that are notorically associated with the Prague Magistrate.
Socialists should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest Prague golf hole", "go into the conditory", "Stiernacken", "Raad of the Capital" and "Bleaking".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, but the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future chief of the Prague Schools - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even take off the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from before.
"These things don't matter to me and how the citizens' democrats talk to each other, I don't judge it."
"For me is important how we understand within our programmes," he argued.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký was not supposed to have recognized in the above-mentioned text that by the influenceful entrepreneur and friend of the ex-burger champion Bém, Roman Janoušek is the speaker.
The term "voldemort" says Kaucky nothing and the only term he correctly obtained during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, adding to security, "But I know that rather from the newspaper."
And weirdly, "I think I'll have to show a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then not only decoded by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the President of the Council for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as tunnel Blanka.
Both socialists, however, also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and thus what it means "to go into the conditory".
"I think that is to go to any Prague gastronomy operation," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušeks companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he is interested in having created these knowledge from the newspaper rather than being his own vocabulary.
Indeed, to judge the test participants, there seems to be no similar inhabited serpent among the socialists.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there's no such thing in us."
"We call at the name, sometimes we also use accelerators or nicknames," says the Chairman of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - by his party companions salopp called "Hulda".
"In the school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know whether my colleagues call me like that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tested the name and see there - he works.
Councilsherr Weinert is friendly to the partymates of the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Alte", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who made notice of the partial sponsorships before the elections, is called "Igráček" (known Czech Lego-Figur).
Nicknames are the only one to allow the socialists to speak in the internal party.
Hulínský does not like it if it is called "Hulda", but Denik Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague Chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the Gummicnuble Rights" claims to do that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "hexen" and published a brochure
Women who are stamped to witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social features.
They belong rather to the older generation, they do not find any work - for example for health reasons, they are unemployed and have no children.
If one of these women becomes witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Mans are very rarely affected by this destiny."
"As for young and healthy women, they are helping to work and to be born," a ordinary sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a specialized home for more than one hundred women who have been disfellowshipped by their communities.
The local government now decided to act against this abnormal "social measure".
And, for this reason, gave out a brochure that is intended to stop the "hexenfollowing".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," pointed the newspaper "standard" to the dilemma of written information.
However, it is incurred to be accused of witchery in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured from three women and two men to death - they overflowed them with petroleum and simply burned them.
This incident also reported to the server BBC.
However, the actors claimed that the matter would only have been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil was fired, which is used for ritual anointings.
And after the group tried to "explore a wicked spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "hexen" supports people here without respect for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fresses of human souls are a danger before today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least strives to eliminate the witch hunting, the Gambian President has mixed with the President himself in order last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh evolved a monstrous witch hunting after his aunt's death, as they were supposed to have shared in their death and would now try to kill the President himself by black magic."
"To this end, he called Shamane to help from near-Guinea, who, in conjunction with policemen, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, took women and men from Gambian villages violently and brought them to the farm of the President in Kanilai," said the Amnesty International in her report.
The farm was forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effect, but it also resulted in intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arreted people did not survive the stay on the farm.
First, due to the international pressure, the nearly thousand prisoners were released.
A renter of Bakala: He warms up in the oven - still pays higher rentals
An elderly subordinated man is just leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in Czech Republic.
Under the arm a catalogue of three new rental contracts for three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is just banning a penalty.
All three were just raised in the context of the so-called "diregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns of monthly rents, the son is supposed to bear a 2-room apartment with a kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is not even flowing hot water in the apartment and you have to warm in a simple coal oven," he tipped up with the finger on the new lease of the son to whose signing he has a full power.
"But something - I have signed," he declares half-admitted and half-signed.
The Citizen's Association of BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises the renters to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December to publish a guidance on how to act against such contracts.
But the man just turns off.
"One says this, the other one," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava becomes the large "deregulering lab".
After the new year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in Czech Republic, whose rentals do not pay any market-payable rentals.
Actuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG war room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning of this Tuesday.
Right next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency and with her are a calling device.
"Mieten 2011", then a special keyboard button is on the touchscreen.
Shortly typed and the device already sucks out a number note.
We hardly distinguished the number "157" and already piped it on the large display on the roof of the waiting room.
A half a second later you're on the line.
Something later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rental, but the storm in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava the converts with the new lease contracts most of the rentals of the total 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests an increase of approximately 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client centre has been opened since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies answer behind the switch after a moment hesitate when the "cleent" disappears as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a brisant topic.
Before the elections, Parliament's Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD had taken this topic quite loudly, not a wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new soil from them."
"Not even ne. WC glasses were able to exchange them," says the man mentioned in the introductory.
According to the employees, most of the employees are standing on the switch to convince whether they really receive the promised rental reduction that promises them RPG when they sign the special offer in time.
In the enjoyment of a reduced to half February rentals, the other tenants who sign the new lease until 15 December are also expected to come.
Until now, the "deregulering switch" in Havířov is everything other than overloaded by demands.
"From the 360 clients last night, only about 40 to 50 of the rentals in 2011 were due to this place," estimates the switch officers.
RPG offers individual leases, where necessary, on its websites and wall tables.
However, if the rent parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," RPG explains on its websites.
"No one's in court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client centre at least partly gives her right.
"I have 13,000 pensions, of which I remain 5,000 for dinner, where I should take the money for a judicial dispute," he says.
Then the employee will be unsure.
"To see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they shouldn't sign and so people are still waiting," she recalls.
The regulated rental ends in the largest part of Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to the rental increase is an economic need.
"The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - just the critical neglect of the housing fund criticised by the tenants is, according to the household owners, the main reason for the increase in rent.
While RPG could invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling against the polster seats in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red-shining information can be seen over and over again.
"The hire increases in 2011 by 15% and less relate to 31 200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month", is read on the LCD monitor.
Only at 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG, the rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter", RPG argues.
With 2600 apartments, the rental remains at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not jump to the height, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What more - the company has another obligation: all revenues from the rental increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - into new windows and heat control.
But - first of all, they are to benefit the people who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw a - the office also belongs to a children's garden
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of Arch.Design company.
But who would already expect a mini-child garden here, with all that belongs to: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outer terrace.
This children's garden has been available to Arch.Design employees last year.
The projecting and architecture office Arch.Design, whose ateliers come from a whole series of named brünner buildings, was calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the spaces for its corporate mining garden.
In a wise view, as most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the baby tree age and the company is located at the fact that the projectants return to their work as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of shortening work, the children's garden is another bonus to offer the Arch.Design to its employees in the context of their social programme.
Building engineers and architects have so easy to put their demanding profession and the child care of a hat.
The minichild garden is an original idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of management, they managed to gain funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating minichildren's garden is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operation Programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic's State Budget.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies of 2, 8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment could be acquired and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and the operation.
After the exhaustion of the funds (2 years) the Arch.Design company is obliged to continue to operate the minichild garden 3 years at its own cost.
The preparation of this project took place a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing effective assistance in the application.
The children care fully for qualified staff - a nurse and a children's garden teacher, the children's garden can visit children without age limits, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini children's garden, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day changes over several children.
The children's garden is flexiblely adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the children's garden - without prejudice to the company's hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini children's garden is nevertheless comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
The kids play here not only, in particular they are given excellent education - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can at any time take a look at the children, and the stress of the late retrieval of the children from a far away children's garden is so uncomfortable.
The parents therefore use their working time more productive.
It is not surprising that there are natural and loyal employers' relationships here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, who are family-friendly and strengthen their staff marketing through such programmes.
A bone house is also fascinating after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof courageates like the back of a prehistoric equine, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are broken fishmills.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house, with its organic forms, had the nickname "Knockenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splitters and mosaics, the reminiscent facades and all-time soft lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fassade of the house plays with dreamy lines, dear colors and textures, which remind nature and living creatures.
Only when you look more precisely, you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thorough order.
In the night, the whole fassade works even more plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting increases the glossy of colours.
The same swinging lines and swallowed shapes also dominate the inside of the house.
Well-shaped wood copies the window frames, lands, sewing elements of doors, even guckholes and performances.
The Batlló house in the Eixample district on the lived shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the prosperous industrial Josep Batlló, was originally on the departure of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís on an unusual and even cheaper conversion.
However, the Casa Batlló rental house did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Just on its ribboard, the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics at the fassade were his idea.
However, the design of the fassade also worked with many other pictures and artists.
The joint work on the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus, Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís' house Casa Milá in Güell Park, where there are further works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was received from the current inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nickname "Knockenhaus".
Others again called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "like house".
It is also said that at the top of the building the sword of the sacred Georg, the cartridge of Catalonia, was represented.
However, other imageary elements also symbolise hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time.
Something bizarre already courageates her 45 degree negation.
In his creation, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations at that time and did not allow any of them to be confused.
Before the construction, he obtained the appropriate construction authorisation from the city, but the information made by him about the planned reconstruction was so vain that the city fathers two years later were so dismayed by the result that they demanded remedy.
Among other things, the councillors also argued that the building with its pillars even intervened in the public citizen climb.
However, there were no changes, in the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of the district in this regard - Josep Batlló made an application for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and she was immediately issued to him.
The house owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor, there was a societal salon, in the third floor the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment were located.
The ground floor was paved to a jewelry business.
The entire six-story building runs through a stairway up to the roof breed.
By the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and twisted walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnection of rooms.
The social part can be fully linked by opening the salon doors, so a larger society could conveniently talk without having to avoid some intimacy in confidential conversations.
The house also received an extraordinary roof and two other floors through Gaudís' reconstruction, except for a new fassade.
Impressive is also Gaudís game with light as well as the blue and white glassed tiles that are dressed with the inner courtyard and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum degree of light.
In doing so, he simply made use of the principle that White reflects the light better than dark colors that, on the other hand, absorb the sunlight.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can visit everyone today.
In the first floor, the spaciousest and most beautiful apartment of the public is made available.
The owners of the house decided only in the year on this step and this on the basis of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this is a fairly acceptable business, the visits were kept, and they were also extended to other common and roof rooms, including the roof breed.
However, the price for visiting the building monument is not a cardboard steel, it is EUR 16.50, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist licences receive 20 percent reduction.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to meet the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed roast? Women have other desires than men
Not the most great bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rose make the good bed.
However, these must be harmoniously complemented in order to meet the desires of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, size, health condition and not least also the sex of the sleeper.
Similarly, the interior where Matratze and Rost have to be subordinated is also important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house, where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to "heat".
In addition, they are clearly more difficult than usual polyurethane matters.
And they should be turned regularly.
Indeed, if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and are still on a fixed plate, moisture depends on: So it is not excluded that they form under their mud.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what is used.
Those who were a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layers are common, will be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Would all the Eishockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their cut off shoulders, feathers and hips, they simply need a soft layer of Visco shoe (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, sugar-sick people suffering from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and skin,” explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in pols termoons.
That's why I've been dealing with many Eishockey players years ago, but other customers have also brought these mattresses with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today, this is no longer a problem because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech producer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous Eishockey player to appreciate the advantages of the Visco shoe.
This "wonder" actually works very easy.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise it embraces himself regularly on the hot body.
Nowhere it presses, in the night you don't wander around like after a heavy fight.
You're just sleeping much better.
The viskoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (worn fire).
When choosing mattress size, you should still add to the body size the length of the foot soles, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
A man like a woman who is 180 cm tall needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should be available at least 90 cm latitude, which is 180 cm together.
In single beds, for example, singles, 120 to 140 cm are suitable.
The comforts half and for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on your back, you should still be enough space for the light-bearing arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the first master of the polsters and space equipment, who has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for years, and also presents this to specialist schools.
In a double bed, everybody needs his own rose and his own mattresses, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise nothing remains left but to mount the roast at different heights and that is not possible at any bed frame.
Shoes should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which should fall at least three centimeters to the shape layer and the fine polster.
"Do not feel the feathers in any case with the hand or when you sit down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special roast type.
Fully polluted beds with mattress and undergrounds like collapsed siam twins have nothing to seek in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be lifted, and the reference can not be washed, which is already happening and giving today.
And as one night loses between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress becomes slowly a giant (and stopped seven).
This is why experts reject advertising logic, which promises a lifetime of up to 25 years, even life-long warranty.
Every thing has her If and But.
And therefore, a practical advice from the dealers: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, the hygiene of the washable, subtractable transfers should not be discerned, yet it is recommended to use a mattress censor that can be easily pulled and washed.
Even though mattress covers are usually made with round ribbon closures today, so that after opening you get two halfs (sometimes important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone, often faces the inequal struggle between David and Goliat.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a roast?
Get out of it!
Or for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
Also, they should prefer to supply the plate with ventilation holes (if not inside) and use mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket feather cores and fine polsters.
Polyurethane matters do not belong to such a document.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for non-adjustable lattic roses with 14 to 18 feathers (Latex or sandwich mattresses), always paying roses with a larger number of feathers, i.e. 28 and more feathers, with Lordosen support in the Lendenwirbel area and the possibility to regulate the latth hardness.
Adjustable lamellen roses do not include mattresses with feather skeleton, as they do not respond to ergonomic change.
In addition to setting the steep of the feathers, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fixation of the feathers that allows the feathers to be pressed or even distracted so that they allow the pointual induction of the shoulder of the sleeper.
An important thing, namely, for men with broad shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use "herr mattress" soft zones for the shoulder area.
The ladies are also thought - these soft zones are given to them in the hip.
For the most demanding customers, pointelastic wing feather systems (lattoflex) or roses with pointelastic contact paths with so-called multitorsion feather.
The pressure is distributed on several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and filled) headcase to the right mattress and right rust, most benefits are lost again.
Here also a rule: the headbox should support the head, its peaks should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, ideally, a 50 x 60 cm large kit appears, such as the Scandinavian Rivers like it.
In the side position, the headbox (in combination with the shoulder discharge zone in the rose or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Something has meant our modern mattresses with the ones (filled with heu) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their blends.
Also in mattresses, the new magic word is called "Bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, it is used to produce polyurethane foams that are increasingly common to natural oils - such as ricinus and soya oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is the name of mattresses consisting of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress transfers - one of the first were Aloe Vera.
However, you can also enjoy micro capsules that spread fresh forest or lavendel fragrance while sleeping.
Here you also make a difference between husband and woman.
While a " cooler" plant extract is used in men from bear leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the references for women have "heating" effect.
Extracts from red pepper ash shots stimulate the blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes well-heated when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Mattresses of cold foam (he has larger pairs with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
Through the combination of the various steeps (hearts) of cold foams and visco foams, multiple zone mattresses are created, which know exactly where head, hips and fences are located.
However, for a high-quality mattress one has 7000 crowns and more to bear.
However, health matrates are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aid.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was awarded this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and on the rose is not so easy.
Sometimes there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers, offering two mattresses at the price of one.
Thus, the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with a disappeared Visco-Schaum Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density in nearly cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the starts.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in the cool environment it refitting.
So it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure optimally.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but also to increase the comfort of sleep in general.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in other health products, such as special foot polsters that are intended to facilitate the legs and vessels.
Indigenous manufacturers use e.g. the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear of your own children grows, and then more and more parents consider watching them via GPS.
The system that was originally invented for the flag of cars can just as well place people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette box but soon it is not likely to be larger than a bracelet watch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and fear, so they keep looking for means and ways to protect their children better.
Also for the price of impairing their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a matter of geometry spying, but of an effective means to reduce the likelihood that it comes to tragedy," says Petr Pilin from the Society Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases such devices can be abused, for example, if you put it in the bag without knowing it, but we had no such case yet."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
However, he thinks that the child should always know the purpose of the "pack" and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková pointed out, however, that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply eliminates it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they do not want to be controlled."
"The cell phones first raised great expectations with the parents, but they are as easy to turn off as these new monitoring devices," says Mrs Bočková.
Your opinion is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In planned kidnappings, the kidnapper almost always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be arranged."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices find broader use, they would also look for them, as their sales would be safely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases the criminals of the police are always a step forward," the psychologist says.
It admits, however, that similar devices can be helpful in the event of an sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech from the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services both for automobiles and for persons, the existence of such devices can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In expensive devices, even an inclination meter is integrated, i.e., if you stay down and remain movingless, the device immediately sends a warning, indicating the position," claims Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide smart mobile phones with navigation, you only need to include a special software.
The problem of the current location devices is that it is either about equipment in the carton size, the trailers are similar or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the danger of losing them.
Mr Pilin from the Macro As a result, it is said that in the present, you are testing devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"It has the advantage that any attacker has no need to recognize that it is a monitoring or location device at all.
"Or he will note that after some time what the police give a advance of time," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - to armbands or trailers, always the same technology is used as in the vehicle placement.
So the combination of location function using the GPS system (like the navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignitions that you can change the entire Czech Republic you could keep but only two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition, ignitioned with ignitions.
In the previous year, the Defence Ministry had already delivered 224 kilometres of ignition to the army camp.
It is reassuring to know that the forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the sustainability of the ignition tube - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition door from the share company STV Group, i.e. for lipic 40 million crowns.
In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would use the 60 km ignition annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnologists addressed by MF DNES, this statement shows that the entire army should annually complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training from all the generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleansers.
Defence minister Alexandr Vondra and army owneral Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way, the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition can be justified halfway.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But these army stocks would also be sufficient for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts applies to the training of each new professional soldier in full two meters of ignition, then the army has created a relaxing stock for the 225 years mentioned, even under the point of increasing need for the pioneer and special units.
At the Defence Minister Vondra, soldiers recently complained that they had almost no more cartridges for hand fire weapons, so shooting of the missing means is strongly restricted.
Quiet from the underhead shortage.
"I don't understand why they buy such a lot of ignition from us."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we as a dealer want to meet mostly," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defence, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition that the army would have covered himself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year period of use of the ignition and police and army pyrotechnics only for two years.
"In perfect storage, the four years mentioned may also be possible," one of them admits, but wants to remain unnamed, not being charged with the criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the duration of the use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the life of the soldiers.
These tests, however, are not for nothing, but costs other money.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defence is the quantity rabate for the 445 kilometres of ignition.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last year of 244 kilometres," the speaker Pejšek informs us about the position of the purchasers of the Defence Ministry.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of ignitions of the police pyrotechnics, liquidating the ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brother's army, has been exceeding almost 1,500 meters for a few years.
And the police always order only those amounts of this ammunition that it can use before the end of the use.
As a result of the safety of pyrotechnologists, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable ignition is also open.
Nevertheless, the Defence Ministry has huge problems with liquidation tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty when the two hundred thousand heads of Czechoslovakia people army prepared to go to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics, MF DNES addressed, the Czech forces in a few years expect the same problem in liquidating hundreds of kilometres of old ignition, which it has purchased today so "favourable".
Until today, the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
The victorious place in the competition "small businesses of the year" has helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the Franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year's competition "Small Enterprise of the Year" became Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success courageates like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun enjoyed traveling.
Only abroad, he was aware that in Liberec it lacks good accommodation opportunities at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his vacation work abroad and by means of a bank credit, he created a building house with five apartments.
Remembering that he was a high school student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous business.
"The price-quality ratio then irritated me and so I tried to do something against it," Lukáš Pytloun says.
The first reconstructed apartment he hired from foreign workers.
He immediately invested the whole profit into the house, which he then rebuilt step for step to the pension with 54 beds.
He has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberec in only seven years of business.
The most comfortable of them was the Fourth Hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel" until recently.
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé that we sold our Franchise concept and other interested parties at the Franchise of the Pytloun Hotels have already reported themselves," says the entrepreneur's number One last year.
"Great share in this license sale for the operation of hotels had just the victory in the competition "entrepreneur of the year", added Mr Pytloun admittingly.
The victory has brought him more familiarity, even popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win, every visual making is good.
He says that he has benefited from the contacts and familiarities to which it wouldn't have come at all.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I have regular business relations until today."
The praise associated with the success is also slightly conceived to each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be given general recognition."
I do not really see this as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just put into the foreground," Lukáš Pytloun says modestly.
I wish my followers a more quiet year than we had in farm
The victory seuphoria was rapidly disappeared from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, farm has the worst behind itself.
The price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Company of the year last year received Karel Žārský, the company owner of Farm.
The jury then appreciated the efforts he made from the small tool construction in Česká Skalice a company from the ground, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this assessment encouraged not only myself but also all my employees and strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of farm's business history, the effort was to do something useful.
And then, when the State offered his father Karel Îárský as a compensation for the property seized by the Communists, a small workshop for the pacht, he did not hesitate for long, left his career in the company where he was busy until that time and founded with a few of his father's companions a own company for the production of plastic wakes.
A short time later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
In 18 years, they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only by the success of the competition and its medialization, it has also entered into the awareness of non-competitiveness.
"Not only that our customers now consider the brand Farm more intensely, our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country to make greater value," says Karel Žārský.
The last year, however, was not only in the sign of the victory seuphoria at farm.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for sale of tool construction products.
The crisis that then shocked the citizens, but above all companies, just reached their peak - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course we couldn't escape this situation either."
"The turnovers decreased by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even take into account dismissals," explains Karel Îárský
A viable company may also have to take such unpopular measures.
But it was possible to overcome the situation and keep the company in the black figures, even with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to withdraw - in the investments in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from the grant, we strengthened our presentation on international fairs and acquired main prices at domestic exhibitions," says Ž
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnovers are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," lets Karel Îárský trigger.
A question of opinion raised by unfair rules
The question of opinion on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some unfair rules have already succeeded in creating out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next year's question of opinion "absurdity of the year" the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
In this way, more than one third of not quite four thousand stimulated entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the Social Insurance Administration demanded a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the question of opinion, this changes now.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer demand extraction from the trade register in the future when checking social insurance payers," said the speaker of ČSSZ Jana Buraěová.
The meaning and purpose of the question of opinion "absurdity of the year" is to take all the rules and arrangements under the lupe, which have to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to dismiss the disgusting ones.
This is part of a entrepreneurial competition that this year is organized by the Tsch. Economic Journal (HN) and enjoys growing popularity in the public.
If last year the three thousand people participated in the vote, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activities.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we take a leading rank in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activities has been the proclaimed objective of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, Czech Republic takes up the 74th rank in relation to the business conditions, compared to the previous year, an 8th rank is worse.
The competition of the year absurdity was launched for the first time in the year and plays each year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic discomfort from April to the end of the competition.
The web address is www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards the competitor chooses seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets most votes.
Over a hundred, more precisely, 105 unreasonable rules and arrangements have been notified to this year's opinion survey.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finanlists" of competition, for example, are provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways must be paid or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must present every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of competition.
The calling out of competition at the Prague Wenzelsplatz is part of a happening which regularly involves individuals of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Sobodová, the Director of the Association of Small or Medium Enterprises and Trade Managers of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the highlight of competition with the Party.
"Where the State throws the entrepreneurs a knob between the legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so it's my goal to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year which are still unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unfair arrangements from the world show effect.
In 2007, people disturbed most of the entrepreneurs' duty to report to the commercial officer at the place of their permanent holding three days in advance, in order to travel to an exhibition or Kirmes with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was suspended by a novel of the commercial law.
The duty that in 2007 received the second largest number of votes - the obligation to report to the worker’s service tours of employees for up to 30 days - was eliminated by the 'Green Card' law.
And -- all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal weights in the speaking room.
This regulation was somewhat painted by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation fell away.
A new category values socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A news in this year's Fifth Year of Competition of the Economic Newspaper (HN) is the category "Administrative Company of 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Vodafon mobile company, the prosecutor and guarantee of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the year".
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company, companies who are not the only long-term objective of success were notified.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and bought enough material for an independent article.
Although they distinguish diametrally as to the subject of their activity, their efforts still have common denominator - support and consideration.
Here, for example, is about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen Finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, which then participates in numerous tournaments in various sports types.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also cares for her health-disabled workers who represent 70 per cent of their staff, for which it was credited as the "Administrative Company of the Region of Central Bohren" in the competition of Vodafone Company of the year.
In the region of Olomouc, the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which introduced, among other things, a floating and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours a week and without a relative wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company was mainly buying from Czech producers, supporting citizens' initiatives in its surroundings and working according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to minimise the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration for the environment," explains her manager Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region Ústí nad Labem is located on the health of his employees and has therefore acquired them to all notebooks ergonomic chairs and keyboards, and also promotes their employees' home work and uses cartering services, which are offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the foundation "Men in Not", which provides concrete assistance to the current Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
The activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbader region is also worth mentioning, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We donate our employees' contributions to the meal, to the workplace, to increase their qualifications and to the vacation," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Mährish-Slesic region.
As regards the category of responsible company of the year, all district financialists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser at the latest until 15 August.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the betting companies did not answer the questions, they were excluded from the competition "responsive company of the year", but in the main competition of Vodafone Company of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate application only for this competition is not possible because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organised agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests at a public invitation to tender
In the building of the soil fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took arrests in the last days.
The current media business and real estate dealer Luboš G. was dismissed by the detectives in handcuffs.
It was argued that he had tried to manipulate a public competition that is currently taking place in order to settle refund claims in such a way that the grounds offered in the competition were covered by a specific stakeholder.
This is supposed to have paid a half million Luboš G. for it.
"On this time I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person because of the defence of fraud in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of Pilsn Staatsanwaltschaft der Zeitung "Právo", they cannot provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In the way he could manipulate public competition, it can only be speculated in view of the limited official information.
The speaker of the soil fund Lubomír Černá pointed out the question of Právo in this regard, that the police actually took arrests at Pilsner's side of the soil fund and that during public competition.
"It was about a client and nothing about one of our employees," she confessed.
According to the public competition, Mrs Černá had the correct name "Requirement for the supply of claims for the transfer of land in accordance with the ground law" and would take place in cases where several applicants were interested in the land offered.
"These persons offer a higher value of their refund claims to be reimbursed by the transfer than the property value chosen."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is defined, then the ground fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. was obviously available for information who had registered on the call and, since he was the right person himself, as he had bought a number of refund claims, he offered an interest in the property that he would withdraw from the competition.
Apparently, against a fat inventory.
This would also be an adequate explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pilsner Earth Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former Head of the Soil Fund Václav Sankota, who was criminally persecuted, because he issued in replacement refunds land that had already taken place decisions on construction projects.
At that time Luboš G., for example, acquired land that was intended for the construction of public streets, at the place where the construction of the access magistrate was planned for the business area Borské pole.
Later, he exchanged these very favourable with the magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which exceeded the value of the land.
The council then had to give a heavy heart consignment in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the property.
The housing costs of households increase by a few hundred months
From January onwards, households must not only expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and waste water fees, and for remote heating and some places also grow hires.
Since January, families will have to draw hundreds of crowns more monthly from the wallet than before.
Electricity becomes up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and some places also deserve remote heat supplies.
The households only cost a few hundred more kroner each year.
The strong flow prices were reduced by all main suppliers, so the debt is the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic facilities.
Although gas only becomes moderately expensive, this is precisely when people have to warm up and have the highest consumption.
So here too is to be calculated with some hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas become expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for remote heats are different from city to city.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 crowns more monthly from January to January, more than 1000 crowns more per year paying families in Liberec.
On the other hand, the inhabitants of Prague threaten 9 percent higher water and waste water charges and this if the city increases the infrastructure rentals.
If the rent does not change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains the lowest compared to the entire Czech Republic.
In the northern trees, where prices already belong to the highest, water and waste water charges should rise by 7.4 per cent.
Large rate increases are expected, for example, in 140.000 rental apartments, where from January, the so-called rental regulation falls away.
For example, CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by 100 percent from January onwards.
Whoever does not agree with this increase of rents, he wants to be legally interested in the company.
The regulated rentals, which are still paid in nearly 300 000 apartments today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with Fernet and room beer is out - it just works too slow
Fernet, room and vodka, exceptionally a good whisky that you stole to the father from the house bar.
These are the beverages which have to be treated most necessarily by Czech teenagers under fifteen.
No exception are children who have to sleep in the hospital repeatedly.
This is evident from the experience of doctors faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children’s departments in clinics.
"Bees or wine are completely out of the fashion because it simply takes too long until you are drunk."
"The trend today is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, head of the child department in the Mediterranean Hořovice Clinic.
"Whisky, if it succeeds to dispose of a bottle from the housebar, and if not, then at least remote or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix him with juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right.
"The most frequently it is about Fernet or Room."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at basic schools."
"Something was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," said Mrs Jurinová.
Chefarzt Pelikán claims that there are no exceptional appearances in the hospital in the past of thirteen or fourteen years of drinking.
Before the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he has been working for ten years in the pediatric department of the Motol Hospital, where the rescue cars delivered drunk students from Nah and Fern.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began at 12 years when she was first introduced with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly difficult case.
"She was in the exhibition area in Holešovice at any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't seem strange that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief wonders.
Just the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in injury with their own syringes is considered to be one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependency in the true sense of the word in children.
"On alcoholism, a long-term chronic dependency is to be understood of alcohol as well as all the phenomena associated with it, and that is not the case with these children."
In those who enjoy repeated alcohol, a negative family-social background is characteristic", explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
The spokesman of the Motol Hospital, Mrs Jurinová, said that until mid-November, about forty drunk children were assigned to this department for child and youth medicine.
However, only cases of heavy alcohol poisoning that required hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Drinked children who are brought home after ambulance treatment by parents or, where appropriate, by the police shall not be registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink a bottle of snaps in the school bank, there are, according to Mr Pelikán, three seasonal amplitudes on which a hundred percent leave is: Walpurgisnacht, silvester and the end of the school year.
"The latter was called for two reasons - either for distress because of the bad witness or for the joy of holidays."
"I have also experienced seven drunk children at once in the Walpurgis night," stresses Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better than a child who will fight with a unpleasant cater the next day.
The headaches in the morning afterwards, which are caused by dehydration and glucose shortage, can be disposed of in the hospital with a fluid-sensitive infusion with glucose and nutrients that lack the organism.
"They're obviously better on it, because after the "lorious" experience in the evening, they're resurrecting with good noise, without any hurt."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, which sometimes degrades the good noise of the patients by counting them the costs it will cost the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in an accut bed comes well and pleased to a few twenty thousand crowns.
"In the past, I used this as an educational tool if I have calculated directly to the children at the visit, what has cost their drinking, and that it can happen that they have to work over all the holidays to earn the money for one such feet," added Dr. Pelikán.
However, he believes that the hospitals do not take into account regression procedures in order to require the costs of parents to cure the children who are drinking.
Two training planes L-159 first in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighters L-159 from a total of five, who exchanged the Czech Defence Ministry against the Casa C-295M transport plane, fled to the Spanish city of Sevilla on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It's the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
They have been seen abroad only in manövers or flight shows.
This is the flyable two-sitzer version L-159T1 operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three planes are lonely L-159.
These are currently conservated in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took it last week.
When she expedes the planes physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
On the other hand, the one-sided fighter planes L-159 were excluded from long-term aircraft without further deposits and investments from the Ministry Resort.
"The double seats L-159T1 were exchanged in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to come out without two-site battle planes, since the Defence Ministry signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody on the conversion of four overflowing L-159 to the two-site version in May 2009.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second will take it until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, the EADS has committed itself to implement the fighting planes into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"In the contract, it is clear and clear that the company is EADS receiver of aircraft L-159 and that they are intended to serve as the training of pilots of the NATO countries.
"It is therefore the dealer's case in which he realises the matter," said Pejšek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange trade of five L-159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of other planes for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved by the Mirek Topolánek government last year.
The Ministry of Defence hadn't declared a procurement procedure for the purchase of tenders at that time, but addressed EADS directly.
The Defence Office argued that this exchange would support future L-159 exports to abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only used 24, and the rest wanted to sell them.
The purchase of Casa planes is likely to have a judicial rehearsal.
The European Commission appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three planes of Casa, which is the last one to land in fourteen days at the airport Kbely.
A longer showing finger than ring finger means a lower risk of being sick of cancer
Men whose showing finger is longer than the ring finger are evidently exposed to a smaller risk of being sick of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is intended to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosteron.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this, in particular, for men to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should be subject to a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, added Mrs Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed over 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but 3000 healthy men at the same time.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the right hand finger was shorter than the ringfinger.
For these men the same probability of prostate cancer was applied as for 19 percent of the men whose ring and show fingers were equal.
However, in men whose finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, in men to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already prenatal, evidently reflects the different levels of gender hormones to which the child was exposed in the liver mother.
Lower testosterone corresponds to a longer show finger.
Previous research showed that just the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was known to him, yet he does not think the relationship between the fingerlength and the cancer risk has been "respected".
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like the largest part of Europe, Czech Republic is under a snow deck on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walking roads is mostly fastened snow, the winter servants were many places all night on axes.
The D5 motorway between 89 and 90 kilometres towards Rozvadov is blocked for some accidents from trucks and trucks and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ of the dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (UAMK).
At miles 91, a truck unhappy, at miles 93, two trucks collapsed, in the event of this accident there are injured.
A few cars are also in the street grave.
There are also problems at kilometres 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here too, two trucks have been collapsed.
The drivers should ride right behind Brno at 190 kilometres or cross Brno and travel to the town of Kývalka at 182 kilometres.
There is a mileage of stable.
Also on the D11, an accident has happened and this is the same thing as the journey to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimeters of thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns form themselves in the district of Prosek, also the street Štěrboholská is completely stopped.
The safest means of transport is, at least, the metro.
The roadways run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peace Square.
At 8:00 a.m. the Prague's crisis stack meets.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Train had to cancel seven high-speed connections due to snow defects.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
The travellers should inform themselves about the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed from Wednesday 11 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Most roads in southern marrows can only be accommodated with increased caution.
At Vyškov, three sideways are completely unavailable, in the vicinity of Brno, and in the vicinity of Blansko, it is forced to use snow seeds on some higher roads.
Výškov is one of the most affected areas.
There are three roads still fully locked: Rousínov - Slavekov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here you will also need to use snow-clearing snow.
When they get rid of again, they can't be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is given in the area of white carpaten.
On the streets, which may be dispersed for natural protection only with inert sprays, one up to five cm thick snow cover, led to ČTK.
In Czech Republic, from two to ten inches of new snow fell, most in northern trees - standing up to 18 inches.
New snow fell up to 15 centimeters in the Mährish-Slesian region.
However, in Czech Republic it stops slowly snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent gun".
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and move the force ratio to their favors.
The new gun is like a super precise gun.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by a laser with a meeting security of only a few metres.
The special fires of caliber 25 mm, designed for this gun and containing high-explosive explosives, function virtually like small granates.
The fireplaces can be programmed in such a way that they can explode at any point of their ballistic route, not only when it comes to the target.
That is, you can use it against an enemy who hides behind a obstacle - a wall or in the guard grave.
It is usually not protected from the top, so the murderable steel splitting rain from above can easily exclude it from battle.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new battle gun is the first infantry weapon that makes itself use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is actually doing so: he shows the target and sends out a laser ray that determines the distance, then he wins a precise point of view, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to print.
"Let's say, you've measured 543 metres."
"When you push down, the gun is loading up and shooting the shot to the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu Group transfers its establishment in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their job from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese group of Fujitsu transfers its establishment in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As announced on Wednesday, in July next year, 400 women and men will move their work in the previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on the Lyon Street in the Frankfurter district of Niederrad.
One speaker from Fujitsu explained that there should be another 100 jobs in the group, which have been distributed to the region in the medium term.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large room offices in the Astro Park would be better at the work of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a renter.
The responsible manager Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent migration of an important company within the region gave the winners joy and disappointment in the losers yesterday.
The Frankfurt Economic Dezernt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this would have been won a "global player".
That would be a "great location knowledge".
Fujitsu fits to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Lower Wheel.
The Oberburger Oberborgermeister Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regreted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by the management of the intention.
"We have, of course, offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader place.
Finally, economic reasons would have given the outcome.
Now it's about preventing a long empty position in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and hirer of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at the Council Hall Square and the nearby "Small Vertical" were among the remaining buildings at the Marienbader place ten years ago among the most controversial construction projects in the Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, between railway station and rathaus, a new city centre was created, both due to the massive construction of the previously used areas as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travelling distribution systems, the start of Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens at that time.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold on to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu consumer in Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad is to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, Astro Park's office building was hired 7000 square meters.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped base ris - the Central Association of Electronic and Electronic Industry has its seat.
Amazon locks server - threats to Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in distress.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressures behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is supposed to stay in England.
The WikiLeaks Discovery Platform is increasingly operating in the United States.
The Internet Activities lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
However, the prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and companies to the Boykott of WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's flag list, is supposed to stay in Britain after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks disappeared by Amazon server."
"Free Speaking in the country of the Free", the disclosure activists informed Twitter by short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Soon before, the Internet company had banned Amazon the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had reacted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in publishing the secret diplomatic depths in order to manage the high access numbers to the documents.
Vice-President WikiLeaks said, "Prima - our dollars are now spent to occupy people in Europe."
If Amazon had such problems with freedom of speech, "they would stop selling books".
Amazon stopped the use of his servers by WikiLeaks after the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman had investigated, the TV broadcaster CNN reported at the office of Lieberman.
The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Protection threatened Amazon with a Boykott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have wanted Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of Classified information by WikiLeaks," the Senator said.
Lieberman called on the platform to reject the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, incredible and inconvenient approach puts our national security into risk and threatens life around the globe," says a communication from the parteilos senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help WikiLeaks with its efforts to spread stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is searched for rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on the flag list of Interpol.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet Activist has always called the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of its opponents.
WikiLeaks-speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange fears his security, Mrafnsson said.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Mrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revealings be accused and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, a consultant of Head of Government Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said in television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, a stroke was burned.
The speaker of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "incredible and absurd" that Assange had requested the withdrawal of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently known spionage calls for diplomats.
"I'm not sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The US Government now puts the protection of its databases fully on the test level.
As a special representative, the Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Action, Russell Travers, had been appointed, the White House informed.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms", which had been necessary after the disclosure of the message reports by WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to make the ways to check how the whole government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. Government also announced that they would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active ones, they should be in danger by the WikiLeaks publication.
"We have done everything to get in touch with them," said Foreign Officer Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it should be necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice coditors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest chance and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From Gelataio and from Gelataio.
The gelatiere, in German a bit older than the ice coditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian eismacher art.
The Gelataio picks the ice cream out of the refrigerator, stretches it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, he won't pass by the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice-university has set up the manufacturer of ice-machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest chance and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several-day special courses around chocolate ice and practices in the home-own ice cream.
Some dream in the midlife crisis of a new career, others simply dare to get on the smooth ice on their vacuum cherish.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, artistic teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to put something on his own in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in her bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatine Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also the silent taste and the good consistency.
Luciano does not forget, however, in his training, the gum of the national and even Southern overbuilding: "Italian gelato is just the best - and then there is a lot of romantic."
The first step to manufacture seems very simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, nuts, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic programme and then cools to four degrees immediately.
Then he turns a hook on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice varieties.
Immediately, the doctor will be intimidated with questions: Can ice cream only be manufactured with natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can you let your own experimental desire go free?
Luciano warns about being led from time spirit to misleading.
Whoever speaks of ice cream "only of natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guarch flour from the guarbone.
Of course, you can produce ice cream without a stabilizer, only then it needs to be sold within one day, otherwise it sucks together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Some variations on the basic mass are allowed.
Spanning it will be with the flavours.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit department or in the sweetnesses of the supermarket.
There are also powder and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to touch you with dozens of aromatized additions."
"But you should just experiment."
Either in the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just at the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes with eggs to yellow cream and with cocoa powder for the basis of all possible chocolate transports.
Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and haselnuss ice - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subject to the fruit ice varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit-puree - tasteful that is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss ice does not necessarily taste more nuts if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice creates the work group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilising.
Only a balanced mixture correctly highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Eishmaking is a calculation task: if pfirsich purea is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A extraction of sugar is required for lemoneneis.
Luciano draws a device to determine the sugar content of the fruit species (winners measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate computers.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device for automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a device where the finished ice mixture is beaten creamly simultaneously and cooled to minus temperatures.
All automation to the despite, small pounds are not out.
The Brazilian Gustavo decorates himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit purée when the superdimensional stack mixer excludes him from control.
"In every course," Maestro Luciano says, "it's only a question of time until something like that happens."
Control clocks in the thickness
The European Food Authority Efsa is undermined by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This claim now forms the expert group Testbiotech, which is understood as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotech.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said Testbiotech-Chef Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the head of the Efsa Expert Group for Genetic Changed Plants, and another Efsa Expert have been under contract for years with the lobbyist association of Ilsi.
It is paid by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the Efsa tests for genetic plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, then criticized.
The Efsa regulations are, however, of course, with position documents of the Ilsi and therefore deceive the manuscript of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the Italian Parma Authority.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech is facing a collision of interests.
Thus, a high-level Efsa manager was recently without any obligation or transitional time to the Swiss Agricultural Group Syngenta - and thus changed the pages.
The Mediterranean broadcast (MDR) has also recently revealed personal links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which have made the environmental community as well as the EU parliamentarians clear.
However, the Efsa cannot detect any conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of the industry, are taken as long as they are of high technical quality, is stated in an opinion.
Of the experts working for Efsa, they do not demand that they have no contacts with the industry.
But you'd have to open up these.
Kuiper awards his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This refers to itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby commission.
In the case, independent experts such as Dan criticise that geneticly modified plants are currently authorised without any feeding attempt in animals and the reaction of genetic plants to environmental impacts is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what geneticly modified maize is doing on the field," says Dan.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you're not looking for the risks, how can you find it?" then asks accusingly.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees like this.
Since 1994, the scientist has been researching in genetic technology and is currently working at the Zürich Technical University.
Industry in this area, as in the United States, is now attempting more and more to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not confused with groups.
Critical studies would generally not be published for companies.
"The industry controls security research," claims Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell is also worried about some 400 pounds.
On Monday evening, he was forming Stuttgarter Railway Station, the Tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It cuts.
The story is known: In September, the Baggers were touched and began to break a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the billions of depths of the railway station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing was in drums.
Crushed in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft rough stone, cultivated between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He secured some of the pieces.
"These stones are relicies."
"You can't disappear."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he sucked one, he smoked for cigarette quarry.
What he'll do with the pieces, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The track of the Stuttgarter stones leads into a forest at Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone-rich.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those who fell in Stuttgart at the departure.
"It would be a shame that they would paint to shots or disappear in the deposit," he says in his office, a wooden farm that once was a guard cabin.
He was intimidated and threatened, he told when in September, in the newspapers, he bought the rest of the northern wing from the interruption company.
But he talked to the S-21 captains for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for the arrival.
And if it happens, it would be the sensible if the stones were continued to be used.
Approximately 200 S-21 consignees took one of the hard quaders in average 80 kg, piece price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but some also in the hope of being able to give it back in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large trucks.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest is sold for long.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, housekeepers.
They had come from everywhere and had pulled away what bag room and trailers could bear.
The Stuttgarter stones of the attack have been transformed into "Mauerle" forever or into restrictions of herbal beds.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"Don't be the political component."
He climbs into his terrain car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of kingdom.
Jura he studied and canceled, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones stored.
From all over Germany he carries his treasures together.
He says he's the largest Altstein dealer in the Republic.
It's braking.
In the snow are artificially decorated sandstones.
"They once belonged to Dresdner Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the way through the forest.
He pointes to a hip: red sandstein, former part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And go on.
"Beautiful Travertin."
The quaders once belonged to the tribe of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgarter Police Bureau, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what hardness, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones had been hooked by hand and moved with simple bottle trains and oxen cars, he becomes very honorable.
"It would be a scandal if you screw up like that."
He hasn't become rich, he hasn't even been stone-rich.
But 14 people are busy with the stone dealer today, as well as in the forest stone metze, a sculptor, a slide, a glass blower and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the remainder.
He's gonna have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save there.
Talent Fighting High Potentials
There's rough Andrang at the buffet.
16 students are pressing around salmon bread, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are to meet together with VW developers through the car of the future - and all alongside Volkswagens.
In the competition about the smartest heads, many companies are now going to the nearby battle and, like VW, put on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the hearing halls before they come to the labour market and are purchased by others.
And because the universities do not publish lists of the performances of their students, they try to curb the exceptional talents in practice projects and bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group turns around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ball writers, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of practicing programmes and student jobs and shows them ways in the groups.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig is responsible for the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and collect experiences."
"VW can at the same time meet students, look at interesting candidates and consider who would be in question as employees."
Such cooperation, so Selle, is not unusual.
It's new to be so offensive about the students.
"Once the focus was rather on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates is probably going to be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of candidates.
In particular, they need to prize themselves and particularly to balt for highly qualified workers.
Especially graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Engineer VDI Association, over 40.000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called engineering gap will become even larger.
For the economic auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunting.
He organizes outstanding recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern cutting hunting where the participants need to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the USA next year.
Besides, participants can view KPMG filials and meet the company.
Anyone who is allowed will decide in two rounds in front of the field.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many applicants fly to the United States.
During hooking and climbing around the high potentials at the universities, the protectors are increasingly growing according to Dykta.
"We want to remove the race from the mass."
"Only a simple sailing session was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta, the invoice seems to be up.
"We have contact with all the participants in a similar action last year."
"Some people stand shortly before their conclusion and want to apply soon with us," he says.
In addition to the direct bubble at the campus, small and medium-sized companies are also very classic at professional measurements.
"We're trying to reach graduates at experts."
"One on the Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, staff leader at Solar World Solar Engineering Manufacturer.
The Bonner company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stöve knows about the post-adult problem.
There are currently 35 jobs on the company website.
"It's very hard to occupy vacation positions."
"That takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the university in Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that you can do practices or write your diploma."
Expensive advertising reactions are not reported in solar specialists.
For this, the company is trying to advertise for himself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and light communication.
"This can't often offer a large group," says staff manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good rising opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld was the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
To this end, employees ask how satisfactory they are with their work and job environment and look at the framework conditions for employees.
Personnel manager Stübe hopes that the positioning will also provide additional points for the job seekers.
"I think that applicants are looking especially at external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as a employer is to lead over your own employees," he says.
In the Branchenjargon, the internal employer Branding is called employer branding, i.e. employer brand training within its own employee.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat his people well and identify them with the company, they would be advertising for their employers from themselves alone with friends and friends.
"That's like a game with bande," says warrior.
Obama stops new oil drills
There will be no new oil drills in the coming years before the coast of Florida, the Gulf of Mexico.
A corresponding ban has been adopted by the government in Washington and thus finally revoking its previous plans.
New drills are also banned before the Atlantic coast.
This was noted by Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April is triggered by the strict prohibition to be applied for at least five years.
Before the accident that eleven workers cost life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The advocates want to reduce the dependence of the United States on aliens from abroad.
Those who are responsible for the devastating oil pestilence in the Gulf have not been finalised until today.
In the centre of criticism, the British energy group BP is faced with billions of demands.
An investigation commission on Obama's order is to present its results in December.
In October, interior minister Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop which was attached after the explosion.
Following this, several oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drill projects.
With sharper controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
At the moment, the competent control authority, which has been prompted after a number of corruption claims, is being fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama announced to close lucrative tax slurries for the oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current sector survey by the BDO consultant company - even before the ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investment in new funding projects would be suspended to a further extent - to the extent that growth is burdensome.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the tank station: billions of litres of raw oil has destroyed the nature of Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from steal, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means it's good.
"Don't plead off," the ecoactivist calms the journalists, "You'll still get enough oil slam in front of the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued an attempt to light up a kid to the breast in the water with the surrounding clays: In the rainbow-coloured water glance, the scene is almost beautiful.
That under the surface of brown oil sweats is not seen.
In the past, she had sickly collected yarns here, tells Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the flowing waters were totally dead.
Five years ago, a brushed pipe poured out plenty of raw oil into the huge moisture area.
Fishermen from the nearby Bodo town must now run six hours to get into fish-containing waters: The Ogoniland located in the heart of the Nigerdelta is considered one of the worst corrupted regions in the world.
On the ride through the mangroves passing through rivers, the entire extent of destruction becomes eye-conceived.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat boils brown bridges, who digs his hand into the water, pulls out odd fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees snail like black lacquet rods from the ground, sadly let individual palms that apply to them hang their weeds.
Bird warms, as they are otherwise common in moisture areas, are forgiving: as soon as the outer border sweats, in the softly smelling past paradise spreads with excited peace.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window, "We live in constant danger to health."
The comparison of war is appropriate.
Andoni's settlement area is a battlefield for decades: over 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe were organized here in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to set up its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Still today, the company is declined to return to Ogoniland: While the whole Delta region is pumped from the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drill sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines daily more than two million phases of black gold, the oil fields are broken in Ogoniland, too unstable is the position of the group.
All few hundreds of meters stealing sites such as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" are called the heads of the drill holes too delicately.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to mark.
Once and again, such a drill head breaks apart, says apobari, then a constant flow of raw oil runs into water.
More than two billion liters have been flown into the delta ecosystem in 50 years according to expert estimates: year by year the amount of oil, as they were in the havary of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" in the sea before Alaska 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the persistent eco-GAU is disputed.
During the shell group Sabotage and the organized oil dieft steel are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectors see drilling heads and leak pipelines as the main causer.
In Nigeria, Shell puts much lower safety standards than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner presented the 2008 group: the rate of defects on the lines alone is "a multifold higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from the distance like an abandoned, oil-smeded workshop under free sky, diving out of the mangrove shapes: they are split necked and to the neck of the neck.
One of the many vessels, which are partly connected with tubes, is partly arbitraryly scattered on the ground, flakes a fire: an illegal small refinery.
In the fashion the raw oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the boss of the group.
First, petrol pushes through the pipes into the cap, later drops at the end of the leadership of Kerosin and eventually diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four boxes of diesel à 300 liters every day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira in" - about $22.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil country of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low diesel price with nearly 40 euro cents per litre can still be banned by illegal cookers: because their raw material will get them for nothing.
It comes from "bunkers" who take the pipeline network across Ogoniland: in this way, according to experts throughout the Nigerdelta, at least 16 million liters of raw oil per day is lost.
However, only a small part of the preliminary intermediate raw material disappears illegally: the proportion of the lions fills organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, in tank ships and strengthens it on the world market.
The debate whether the environmental disaster is more debted by the circulation of the population or the salmon of production, the activist Apobari considers that Apobari is purely academic.
"If the oil companies wouldn't be seen as invaders and they wouldn't have destroyed the fishermen's life base so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor stealing nor illegal refinery."
Meanwhile, the Ogoni relationship was mainly to shell, but so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the group would be questioned: "Perhaps other nationalities such as the Chinese as better."
That's where Michael gets nervous.
"The maximum time you disappear," says the musculoskeletal oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If illegal oil distributors are captured by the special unit of forces, they are not threatened to arrest, but maybe a painful smuggling money.
Also, most of the soldiers coming from the country's arrival, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn thing has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Apobari.
Detecting dangerous failures in A380 engineering
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Researchers have discovered a possible failure to build in the investigation of an emergency machine that could lead to a "disasterous engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to complain to the engine manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Qantas-Airbus had apparently known much more happiness than so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines, and now warns about a possible failure to build.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil sludge connection, it could produce fatigue rice and leaks, it stated in an opinion published on Thursday by the ADSB Authority.
This could have resulted in "a catastrophic engine loss".
Rolls-Royce's engines were affected in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Qantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November, is located below.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal steps against the British Turbine manufacturer.
It submitted an appeal to an Australian Bundesgericht in Sydney, which allows him to take further legal measures against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said that his airline would require compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
At the fire of the engine, parts had solved and damaged the wearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be exchanged worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that further safety tests should be carried out on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had held its A380 fleet for weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left about three of his 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
At an A380, the Lufthansa exchanged the engine as a precautionary measure.
The double-sticked flyer is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
The country-wide snowfall triggers transport chaos
Germany all in White: Overnight snow has fallen almost throughout the country.
Chaos, trains and flights fall out on many streets.
In case of car accidents, at least three people died.
The winter frozen Germany: at ice temperatures almost the whole Republic is cut on Thursday - which leads to transport chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there are some 15 centimeters of thick snow decks.
On several motorways and many roads, transport is strongly restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was in permanent effort, but the constant new snow was not finished.
In addition, violent blows feathered over the Baltic Coast.
The Bundesamt für Seefahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) expects at the East Sea Coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning on storm flows with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, snow deflections on motorways and federal roads led to major problems.
According to the storm-center meteomedia, the alarm level was violet - the highest level at all.
Partly there fell 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds provided defects.
There remained several trucks and cars stuck in the night.
In Sachsen-Anhalt, the police also reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to stocking traffic and stiffness.
The A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall in Thüringen.
According to Deutscher Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Sachsen-Anhalt, Thüringen and in the northern Bayerns.
Snow on the rails, crashed trees on the rails or destroyed pipelines and softs are the main problems.
In Saxony, Fernverkehr from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thüringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemans and rescue helpers with clouds, food and drinks in the train.
Snowwinds fistled over the streets.
On large German airports, snow winds lead to numerous flight losses.
In Munich, according to a spokesman of the Air Exploration Center, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights were already deleted, according to a fraport speaker.
The winter service is in permanent operation.
Although only a few passengers on the airport are travelling, there are still nearly 400 field beds available for them.
On many streets, accidents occurred on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died at the interconnection with a train on a train transition in Eastholstein.
The locomotive leader was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg, snow-covered streets resulted in a similar accident: even here a truck was covered on a train transition because the vehicle stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore locked up until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had overturned her car at Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
However, a good news has the meteorologists: Although the snow will still be calm and powdery and therefore already revolve in light evil.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is searched by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - location up to negative 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks a buyer for their twin storms
The Deutsche Bank wants to distinguish from its mark: According to a newspaper report, the Money House seeks buyers for the two office towers at their Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to EUR 500 million could spend the property.
The German Bank has just made its group seat beautifully: the twinstorms in the Frankfurter Bankviertel have been modernised; the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group seems to want to recover the cost of renovation - looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes on a speaker.
The speaker did not call reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it is more useful to own or sell real estate and then turn back," he said.
Thus, Germany's largest credit institution has already returned its company's headquarters in a short period of time.
The Bank had taken the double towers for 272 million euros from the investors of a home-owned fund until mid-2007 and then refined upwards.
The energy conversion swallowed the data to around EUR 200 million.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industrial experts estimate the value of the "Greentowers" towers of the newspaper, according to about EUR 500 million.
Whether the buildings are again sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, are still open, said the speaker.
Thousands Sad for Dead Friend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the threwd mountain people who have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be protected because the safety situation in the cage is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth had been explosive.
29 mining workers aged 17 to 62 were shaken under days.
A sin had been left down in the cabinet, but had not discovered any trail of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could decline for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer a chance of survival for the companion.
The bodies could not be protected so far.
Now family and friends with a Memorial reminded of the dead.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island when sunshine shields.
For two minutes, they're silent.
For the honor of the sheded men of the mountain were 29 tables on which the helmets, lamps and the names of the companions were seen.
Images and personal items, including clothing pieces and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags swept to half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the mountains would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said New Zealand Minister John Key to the participants of the Memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not finish with the death of his son as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was shaken in the grave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and victims, several foreign diplomas attended the Memorial.
At the first explosion on November 19, mountains had also been shaken from British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are exhausted, they are started to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, Police President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Fuck, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
Regisseur Nicolas Winding Refn relocated old genre limits with his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner Wikinger warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) liberates himself from his pingers and with almost superhuman forces turns around his opponents in order - sounds ideal for young male observers looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes rabiater killing methods and his enemies already pulling the bones out of the living body when he has bad lounge.
On the other hand, an eye, as it is actually called, says the whole film about no word, and the other figures can be cut off at most to one or two sentences or a few painful death shouts.
Otherwise, it is swollen and swallowed in the terriblely beautiful hilllandscape of Scotland, which the Wikinger world offers about a thousand years ago.
Idealer for adult cineasts with interest in existenceism and very quiet camera trips.
Beautiful, if a movie has several target groups, only damage if they exclude each other.
Regisseur Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses steadily to make his works available to the arthouse with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality.
Most of the arts kino friends are likely to be frightened from the spraying brain mass and the bowels around.
The action fans die no later than long ago, when the enemy is dead for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries through a ship to Jerusalem and holds an eternity in flood and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to sweat.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a movie lease in Germany and now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody fassade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this movie it isn't about dialogues or a stringent action, it's all atmosphere, a film-armed fever space.
And there is no escape from that for the spectator.
He can't give him a moment of relaxation and snatch him with his ice pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack slowly to the throat, but especially with the inconscious hate that strikes him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blunder boy who is faithful to one eye retains something like innocent, all others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-eye hero, whose motives are never explained, but who becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporarily alliated at any time, possibly to the messenger of the Devil itself.
He means corruption, but maybe only for those who have been corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, for angry, exciting and astonishing.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country is fighting to take a position in this regard - nor is it allowed to control.
By midnight, on September 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighting planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the river of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-sau.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria claims to have built with the help of North Korea in the quader, hides in a valley that is off the electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. Secret Service CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor used to produce plutonium would also have been suitable to build nuclear weapons under the name of the nearby village el-Kibar.
For other purposes, however, the technique from the fifty is hardly good.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unsharmed satellite images.
By computer animation, she blinded where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the nuclear center of Yongbyon.
She also presented photos that show the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor had been standing shortly before the entry into service, it said, but was not yet fitted with burning sticks.
Today, more than three years after the Bombardement, is hardly known more than then, even the puzzles became rather larger with time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw points of "a active nuclear weapon program" in the country.
Some secretists in Europe prefer to be more careful and speak only of a "reactor" even if they think the CIA representation is "plausible".
You lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asking how sure he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar, which IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The shot of the alleged "unused military building" quickly created the Syrians at the side and planned the area thoroughly.
In June 2008, however, an IAEA team was found under the former head of Olli Heinonen in el-kibar tracks of uranium produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from a Member State directly after the attack which would be more prominent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not to be received on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always served to never operate a secret nuclear program or to have built a reactor.
The uranium is from the Israeli weapons, explained Damaskus.
However, the IAEA rejected it as unlikely after an analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss it - as well as satellite images.
In addition, it refuses the controlurs a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the drums of the broken building.
But Israel also swears iron.
"We will never comment," recently confirmed the official position of the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been resultsless since June 2008 and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the Authority," as a high western diplomat admitted at the IAEA seat in Vienna - finally, there is a serious violation of the nuclear weapon locking agreement in the area over which the IAEA is watching.
As a key to progress in information, the IAEA apparently sees three more facilities that are intended to be "in functional connection" with the contemplating reactor - and different from those still exist.
The inspectors have not yet disclosed the installations, their functions or their suspicions.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are called Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah internally from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and found a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which most likely is one of the suspects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this reason, Syria of the IAEA refuses access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the United States to explore military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a hint from the US home services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader on the Euphrates material was transported to and from.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "in connection with fuel production".
However, "no evidence of sensible activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reconstruction; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
Although the reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
However, where the uranium should have come and where the plutonium should be separated later for the bomb, there are at all plausible suspects about these key issues.
It is also unclear whether the trumpets that could store valuable traces were stored in the three places.
Like the hundreds of truck loads disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the shot has stayed.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres of el-kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has examined in 1998 on its suitability as a stock of radioactive waste, is considered unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently brought her into contact with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria took on the three suspected places of earthwork and removed large containers after IAEA had requested access.
This can be a chance, but has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
In addition, it says in diplomat circles, the IAEA used several months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much the inspectors are interested.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Has western diplomats in Vienna provoked a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has not high urgency, brings about U.S. Messenger Glyn Davies for a few months so-called Special Inspections into the game, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna Atomic Authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA-Chef Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: one is the need for a majority of the Governing Council of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are everything other than inclined to escalation.
Secondly, how a diplomat is to think, "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless government debut in summer, there are troubles.
The turnbook has written herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
A lot more you don't know about it - but that's enough for disturbance.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, is in love during the Yugoslavia war in her Serbian rape.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, and thereafter some working days planned in Sarajevo were transferred to Hungary on a short-term basis.
In the meantime, the film is turned off in Hungary and in postal production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee aid UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is itself an ambassador of the UN refugee aid.
It is not diplomatically - she offered a meeting in Hungary for the women weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not existed, and Jolies' attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the playbook.
Her organization has recommended the UN refugee aid to release Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who received their turnbook, has granted a turn permit for Sarajevo after some of them - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not yet come.
The young author himself cares for not pursuing political intents with her film, has worked hard into the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vacuum when it comes to content.
One second synopsis on the web, which then sounds quite different: the loved ones knew it before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds significantly different from the variant of "violence victims are crushed in torture servants".
That Jolies film actually starts before war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, says Jolie, is "unfair and is based on misinformation".
Now you can only provide Hollywood's hackers with peace: by putting the playbook, as many as before, illegally in the network.
Nothing like this.
This evening, it's finally going around right for the Irish.
No trace of distress.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans joy for joy in crowning loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in the southern Cork bikes because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer beaker - and meet.
"Bierpong" calls the bizarre spectacular, to win there are 500 Euro win premium plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this sharp drinking game and the retained computerist, that does not really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to distract from the boring question what will bring the future.
On his plan is not a game patch in Las Vegas, he will conduct an application conversation in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mouthful feeling with it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still have no work there."
At all: His girlfriend already waited for him in Auckland - "she had back, suck her wish job as event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanner's three sisters have been looking for their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100.000 Irish will probably leave the country next time, as experts at the ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015 they even expect 200.000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4,5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
The facts are the predictions, there is an immigration wave similar to those under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, it is now going to become a tristsis again.
The economic crisis is particularly unassured by the young, well-educated Irish, for which it was only a mountain rise.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the tree years.
Everyone was needed, money was in overflow.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men are under thirty unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are readers' letters of young immigrants who complain: "All goes down the bach in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one will then turn the light off."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future raise, because the government only operates eyewitching and no longer offers the young people prospects for the future.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes her complaints from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, if it's going to have to migrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a rounding service on work abroad.
"For professional beginners, work abroad is a great chance to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website, show photos Surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan knows for half a year.
Since there was no more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're just pulling up a fashion house.
In January it continues to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home now sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay the loan for his home.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says when he walked over the threshold of his house for a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as much as never more."
He's laughing a little down and walking through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a nice housing area with careful gardens, parking large, expensive cars in the entrances.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380.000 euros - 100 per cent financed credit.
"There were crazy times, there were simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could be wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, throws hot tea after and says, "I have no kids I have to fetch and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new."
The engineer doesn't like the woe that he often hears at this time.
"No one has to be hungry - our situation is not far as dramatic as in the past times here on the island," he says.
"A while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we're just feeling like Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open and just look how it goes with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London he has already been behind, and why should it not go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But one thing is still there that concerns him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could get into a life-welcome party.
"But not too many emotions," he says and drinks a big swallow of his beer.
"Bye, that sounds awful."
"Let's prefer to call it a roadgeh party, very easy, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The democtric routine
The democratic movement in Latin America becomes stronger, such as the support of private companies.
Criminality is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarometro survey, which was carried out in 18 countries and was exclusively published in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts fall in the this year's survey of September and October especially in the eye.
First of all, the good atmosphere in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South-American coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic supporters increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong invasion last year, such a trend is seen.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most popular countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (see chart 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermine efforts to increase democracy.
This may have persisted during the world economic crisis because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(As reported by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America from this week 2009, poverty rates in Latin America increased only slightly and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of divorce President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects in a widespread progress thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more sensitive and increased violence crime, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America have seen a bigger problem in their country than in unemployment (see chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been victims of crime last year, but 38% have fallen last year and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance reflects the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the respondents reported that the private economy is essential for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see chart 6).
Approximately 58% explained that only the market economy can make progress in its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has been stating many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, the respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua by Venezuela.
A electoral flap
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts exceeded far the fears of the electoral helpers who hurried to help the poured country.
Overfilled electoral towers, multiple votes, voting certificates in the rinstone, ruined electoral places and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Election rooms opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, struggled around looking for a choice.
Eventually, some gave up.
A dozen presidency candidates, including some contemplating peak riders, demanded that the results of the elections be lifted due to a claimed fraud.
There were partially violent protests throughout the country.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, the Head of the UN Mission in Haiti, called the election "as quite good in many interests".
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "this irregularities, as they may be serious, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, who is claimed to be obliged to the unpopular divorce president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected selection is recommended for January.
There is still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First-Lady Mirlandet Manigat, have withdrawn their initial inadmissibility complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no consent in the voters, explains from the electorate to the winner of the electoral election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a small choice was feared.
On the day of election, many Haitians were obstacles to voting by lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, approximately 250 000 certificates needed for elections were not yet distributed.
There's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government to be an important step in reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Home in the middle
In the weeks after your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, if you help this again next year, it depends on whether the apparently sad Cristina Fernández is more compromiseful than your deceased husband, their predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also directed economic policy after his wife's choice, often set up budgetary plans which did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President's couple to issue the extra revenue on their own.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further destruction.
Some regim critics from the series of reigning peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (which a parliamentary struck another person and others insulted the government of coping) the Congress did not agree with the 2011 budget.
"I won't discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also applicable for the next year, which will give the President more opportunity to spend money on his own.
The economy is running hot: it will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but a number of private estimates - and wage requirements of the trade unions - are driving the value to nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty fighting to his main goals, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, dismantled the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Counting INDEC, which then enjoyed the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate way?
She called on the private economy and trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wages increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
However, inflation undermined growth by a major devaluation in 2002.
Cristina Fernández may, for this reason, want to come back financially to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the former redebt in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to press on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF as usual elsewhere.
However, last month, Minister for Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks like this would be the first step to clean the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after ending their term of office, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, mostly enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the sympathy that was brought to her will be evacuated.
If she wants to win another choice, she must decide whether she quietly lifts many political decisions of her husband.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother outside the seas?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all electorates, made up to choose citizens' championships and town councils in the five city districts. This is considered to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the construction of broken business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbolic figure for the relationships with the continent. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Mother did the test, but only slightly.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) sets three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports a greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes received by the KMT 45%.
In the case of a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his choice two years ago, the vote share of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the town councils together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual incidents in Taiwan, such as truck convoy with scratch makers, flag-swinging mass trails and only sparsely dressed dancers, occurred.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chan of the KMT, held a talk on a KMT candidate in the evening of the election,
When a man shot into his face from the crowd, line was wound, and an outstanding audience killed.
Bizarrally, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill line or to put a dispute with the candidate.
Independently, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the choice and put the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has described more votes.
Perhaps China was the largest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, the relationships with the mainland have not been discussed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their factual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to raise its relationships with the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also avoided the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new consciousness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, on his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese supports his China policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives to the Community.
China immediately sent a subcontractor to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Surely it also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It prefers to wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has been newly invented.
Two years ago she was strongly weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison because of corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he engaged in fifteen for absolute independence.
However, under Tais reign, a new generation of common politicians developed and the DPP fought for the voices of professionals and youths.
As a presidency candidate of the DPP, Tsai found a great consent, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea shirt as a contact point between the DPP and China. This, however, requires disproportionate discussions.
Tsai publicly explained that their party offered a "trustful alternative" to Mass faster approach to China.
Chen seems very angry over this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to stand on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged the practitioner Su to refrain from the presidency candidateship.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its possible candidates.
The KMT will have to carry out its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their electoral struggle without it.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing sharpness between arm and empire.
According to a KMT speaker, it will transform its cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports a restricted approximation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic cooperation with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there's already no return."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you appear on a president's request, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to enter the ceremony at the time of the Nobel Prize Approval 2009. Now, the 26-year-old Jazz-Bassistin and singers were finally nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the Jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual, but it corresponds to the Grammy rules which an artist may have published before the publication of the album with which he was known in the wide public.
Her ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her confused voice and a good feeling for Pop, Funk and Latin Music, you can compare Spalding quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a Jazz artist in this category of nomination Spaldings comes next.
The album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite of critics experienced a huge success.
Among the competitors of Iyers are "Moody 4B" of the experienced Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboard John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, in which more albums can be found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received attention in the category of great group. He thus admits against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octett, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Dagherty, Steve Mackey leads into classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53th Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Dagherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", an eectic orchestra, with three voices.
Among the nominated with connections to southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was ordered by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and carried out in 2009 in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer of Avner Dorman in L.A. was also nominated for his manoline concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums, Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concert Building Orchestra; Daghertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" are played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wandererer" by the Orchestra and Chor of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, pares for symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Grafiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wandererer" for a grammy.
Pärts Symphony 4 was conducted and recorded on 4 January in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The about 30-minute piece has the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnets of Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinen concert" received a nomination in the Instrumentalsolo category with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. announced that he wrote the 15-minute piece specially for the Mandolin artist Avi Avital, who held the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and many North African sounds and rhythms," explained Dorman in a telephone interview.
The director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of Orchestra for recording the works of Strawinski with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his leadership.
As instrumental solists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the Geigerin Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As Vocal Solists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie by Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover, the Soprantic Jessie Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula gains consent from the Committee on Planning
The construction of a mosque in Temecula, after a five-hour public hearing, found the unanimous commitment of the local Planning Committee.
Criticians argued that the project should promote terrorism as well as transport.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre will meet local provisions and will become an aesthetic vision.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday tomorrow.
"As a American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that righteousness is the one."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"You're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre took almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides, according to Press Enterprise, were quite evenly distributed.
The debate was continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no more America," said a comment.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"American is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on 11 September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violencelessness.
His municipality with approximately 135 families has lived peacefully for years in Riverside County, but they wished to have a larger and better place than the camp they had rented together with a manufacturer for water filters.
The new, about 2,300 m2 large mosque in Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minorettes and become about 13m high.
It is intended to be found on the approximately 17.500 m2 store on the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbe could enable new forms of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacteria species that can live, including arsenic, opens new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is their view to be a sign that life is possible even without the elements that have been considered necessary to live.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphor or arsenic to wax."
"That makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'external' life", explained Paul C.W. Davies from the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor and sulphur.
But as the scientists found, the bacterium in the Californian Mono Lake continues to grow even if it replaces phosphor by arsenic.
"You're wondering what else is possible," said the co-author of Ariel D. Anbar report from the Arizona State University.
Discovery is an important step in searching for outer earthly life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on the earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were published on the discovery, gave rise to widespread speculations on the Internet that the report of discovery of non-ground lives could be.
This is not the case.
The discovery "denotes that in other planet systems organisms can start using other elements of biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily firmly defined," explained Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novum because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Astrobiological Institute of the NASA, which led the study, elected the Mono Lake due to the high arsenal content.
Since arsenic and phosphore are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes, both exposed, may replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly based on the chemical behavior of phosphor."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so big that arsenic works different from phosphor. It comes into our biochemical system where it almost all smokes," explains Anbar.
The researchers put the bacterium GFAJ-1 on an increase in arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphor, it can also survive in arsenic, it shows that a arsen-based life form can occur, of course, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a doctor for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphor can be replaced by arsenic is not new. However, there has not yet been a working example.
Arsen occurred more frequently in the early years of the earth, she says, so science has assumed that early forms of life used it.
"There is a reason to assume that life could have developed differently than in the early age of the earth," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simons' research team.
Research has been supported by the NASA, the Energy Ministry and the National Health Authority.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower-Motel were found, according to the Thursdays, by the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as unknown to steal the Chevrolet Express from 2006, where the animals were placed before a Bellflower Motel 6 nights, the authorities' statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well up," said Whitmore.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore did not make any precise information about the place of finding the dogs and the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say so anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're tracking some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district center in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas Trace, a 3-year-old rude, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog, were uninjured, according to the authorities’ statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to imagine Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners on the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend due to the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show in other competitions.
South California is a stop on the nearly one month tour of the couple from dog view to dog view.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their delivery cars in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - in their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the delivery car because it was cooler there.
They opened the window wide, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6:00 as stolen.
Peek promised anyone who could give an indication of the Corgis a finder wage. The animals were implanted to identify microchips.
On Thursday, it wasn't clear whether a loan was paid.
The lion shouts again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18-month turbulencies and uncertainties, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New Yorker bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "preparing" creditor plan to pay the debts of $5 billion and the 86-year entertainment company the way for new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan fulfils the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founder of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will be presented to the awkward studio as the main business manager.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually enters into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which owns $75 million, leads the company. The funding is to be held until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the contract to the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company manager who fought with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, known by his activity at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial care and pay more than 140 creditors of the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few tenderers and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In spring this year everything started from the front when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has overcome the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who has been paid monthly for the management of the company $375,000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio only brought out one film and created a year plan with seven or eight films to come into the cinema at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Small Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films that are to be created under the leadership of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget balanced
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can rip a significant hole into your gift budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic spring ropes or about 48 doses of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronic toys under $80, three national toys dealers - a whale mart, a toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, is a broader offer.
There are increasingly more button cell-operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable battery.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children aged 3 years old) are pneumatic figures, as large as sea pigs that sing a note when pressing on their stomach.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, by multiple pressure you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: If you have started pressing once, you can't stop anymore.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Prize $60, for children from 2 onwards) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon says', and thanks to the new scarnier feet with wheel blocking, it controls the Moon Wall.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complain about the missing volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from the age of 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires, with which a car ride can become a lesson, with a better knower with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child in your smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included therein are not as instructive as those on the leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, lighter screen after Leapfrog's first major revision of the leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8 to 8). The five blocks are not larger than a stroke carton and have a own LED screen.
The game is about to put the blocks together in words before the time goes out. It is great for a improvised bookstabier competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
When you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Penguin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child gets enough credits for two more parts at the Penguin Store Club.
This can be a roller shoe or a puffle pottery.
The latest head cell-operated microbots, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from the age of 5) is not larger than the head of your tooth brush.
The bug moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a wrong garden of clothes.
And he endures some things.
Our one fell from the kitchen table and even passed some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police interventions in China become softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a city place, checked his nervous subjects and gave commands with military authority and damped voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order to impress the audiences of their arbitrary races and their hang to violence.
"Just stand!"
"Blick straight out!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are like it!"
Four girls, hardly grow up to the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants were strawn.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four ordinary hats sat perfectly on the blue-white slides held on the hair.
"For me they look at average," Mr Tang notes lowly.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to polate the picture of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new applicants must have a degree of education.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by Low Stars: 2009 reported 50 officials surrounded an inappropriate imbis car and stared at the operator until he packed up after a half hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened the urban police strips. They have been selected specially due to their appearance, good figure and youth.
You're supposed to give the rubbish police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may apply urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media routinely show another picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province broke a spectator to death when he filmed her with his mobile phone, as they hit a protest against a waste hole.
Last year, a training handbook of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be struggled without blood pouring.
This year, a Shanghaier had watermelone dealer after a handful of five officials had brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China when attacking road dealers.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversies about the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics are clearly insufficient to the current approach.
When the district searched for eight female recruiters in October by advertisement, a editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to job advertising, women aged 18 to 22 were searched with good figure and "harmonic facial attractions".
You should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 ft, 2 1/2 inch.
Employment relationship ends with achieving the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physical.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official stated at the quasi government website Rednet.com.
"If the candidates get the job, first depends on their external appearance, such as size, weight, faces, etc."
Then the temperament and "inner qualitys".
"Women Chengguan is like flower vases," he said and added, "but they have other duties in addition."
Zheng Lihua, Vice-President of the District, does not want to attach this description,
However, in China, size standards in job advertising for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to even faces.
Whether this is similar to good appearance, it is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical dispositions do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lambs or buckles here," said Mr Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang place near a monastery, is 22, has apple bags and a well-formed mouth.
It did not feel sexistic that it was so much valued on her appearance.
"Do you know, I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic looks.
Her colleague commented with the graves, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, "We have the task to represent the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude because they have more ambitious career plans, as simply to shock dealers through the gases to prevent them from making business.
Every morning the strip deals with approximately twelve road dealers who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on the bike or on the bike before they are hunted.
"Herr Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times," explains Mrs. Xu to a dealer who had fled to walk and had temporarily left his nudle kitchens fixed on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than struggling.
"It's almost every day the same," explains Huang Jing, 20 who's studying sales in recreational life.
"All routine."
One reason is that the female officials are not allowed to confess the goods of the dealers, as their male colleagues do.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male supervisors.
This is intended to protect it from public enemies which officials in China are frequently exposed to.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, after the rumor was cursed, Chengguan officials killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officers were injured at night, 14 government vehicles were killed or fired.
Xindu has been spared from such violent excursions so far.
But disturbances are not excluded.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patroled this morning, gathered over 50 people at a street corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle which was repaired instead of in a workshop against the rules on the citizen climb.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute delay, the officials went the way to their vehicles with a cruel face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, remained back. He turned his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supporting role.
But they were not trained in presenting a clean image.
"Sometimes, we're going to go verbally."
"Sometimes, however, also physically," explains Mr. Lintern.
"The most of the time the people start with the dispute."
State Prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
State lawyers of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the accusations raised against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobby activity, the senators announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most difficult pronunciation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which took place on the whole of the country and placed a steamer on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was pleased with the judgment after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's Ethics Committee could impose another disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were suspended and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. Your opinion is that there were sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents opened for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the presumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral helpers, had a lucrative order to buy his silence over a affaire with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was acting as a treasure champagne during a election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton's work. According to the documents and interrogations, he accepted for them according to Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's electoral team, he had no lobby work for his former employer or the whole Senate for a year.
According to Ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were closely friends before the Affaire, disfellowshipped the so-called ban on the turn door lobby cyclicity.
According to the published Indians, "all seems to be an agreement and the infringement of the turn door states," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specialized in the defense of clients who are in the government's vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr Brand and other Ethiopian lawyers said that the Ministry seems very careful in taking political charges after a variety of defeats persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year, to let the charge against the former Senator Ted Stevens fall because of the defence of the prosecutor.
State lawyers "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (a organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign before court.
"This essentially means that high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defence of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another on the next day when he was informed that the Ministry would not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defenceman had cooperated with the state lawyers to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made to the lawyers.
"I don't like to go into the details of discussion between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much was said: We think we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to suspend the investigations for a separate appeal by the ethics group after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons had breached the Federal Election Act.
The electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money had been something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found thanks to Mr. Ensign lobbyist work.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after the company passed on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Staffchef, John Lopez, had a talk with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "cloping" at the Ministry of Interior.
Mr. Ensign was also admitted to lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister for Transport to agree a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying.
The first time last year, Mr. Ensign excused himself for his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he was in the order of the Republicans in the fourth place.
After he had not noticed many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was looking for a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the goal of police research, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, the Senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and set out his investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire call makes attention to Twitter
A half a dozen of them jumped into the crowns in the court hall.
In the minute duration, they sent their reports on cruel witness statements via Twitter.
At the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140.000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and the children chained on beds in a house that went into flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's claim of the death sentence that the jury has spoken.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already submitted requests to the court, explaining the reasons for a procurement and which the courts will work for years.
One of the most provoking reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by an average reporter - has resulted in a circus atmosphere and a so widely widespread, promptly pressing upturnal details, so that the jury was insufficiently affected by public dismantling.
This objection could motivate the appellation courts to discuss whether new technologies are required to make new rules in the court hall.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it really is a danger if the introduction of new technologies to the court hall affects the right of each individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' chief defence.
The president, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Chamber Court, gave the requests by decision briefly and bindingly back last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, judicial infringements have found that the reporting of famous cases has raised doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a cheeseopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there was a "carneval atmosphere in the court hall" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the game film "On the escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that judicial infringements which Mr. Hayes condemns a half a century later might follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the ways of communication from the court hall that were still unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to worry about the influence of the new media in processes that are persecuted by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor of Stanford Law School, who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is adhered randomly.
Professor Donohue said that some appellation courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the court hall could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who present the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss on years and therefore delay a condemn.
For example, the defenders claim that Mr. Hayes could have been condemned already when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential juryrs by showing them cruel teater photos during jurors' selection.
Some of the jurymen have said, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their breeders, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with awful.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge falsely exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the lawyer and that he would have insufficient pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments on the impact of detailed reporting on the process may be the most interesting.
In a ruling which they submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the messages in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the Governor and the American Senate.
They argued that the new media had continuously re-evolved the flames of emotions over the case.
"A day-to-day Andrang of the media peppers, cameras and reporters outside the court hall," the lawyers wrote, "had not even experienced in New Haven and perhaps not even a country-wide."
Your focus on Twitter's reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more opposed than reports that are being sent slower, is a technical enemy view that impairs the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appellation courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes needed the adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers strengthen this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard was suspended due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign on shiny words and negativeness this week, little courtesy has eliminated in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party collaboration or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the battle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the top of the Congress did not bring any breakthrough into the major issues with which it had been discussed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions are taken.
After all what you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sites or a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months leads to mutual respect, which devours the ideological climatics that continue to separate the members.
This is hardly enough to claim that there was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase, which calls for one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while you try to consider the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a re-partial war management.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep as to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that was prevailing over the last two years.
Whether it is taxes, donations, health or waiting, the two sides are kilometers away from each other.
Finally, the November elections of Washington have at least voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the Tonfall has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush Government, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is indispensable after elections.
Elections raise partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have hardly a different choice than to find a solution."
Bush's tax reductions end the end of the year, and no one advocates that.
Both sides want to find a way to obtain some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise is expected regarding the increase in unemployment money, even though it is because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favoured tax reductions for the rich are rejected, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that you can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and ratify the new START contract at the same time.
However, William Glaston des Brookings Insinuation warns that successful cooperation in urgent matters of the lame duck session must not impose a permanent cooperation between the parties when the new 112 congress is called in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps indispensable.
"After the things that have to be done, this short-term psychology will be turned into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepsis is divided by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see much of what happens from today to 2012 as a prefight, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party choosers who were responsible for their education.
How worried the Republican leaders may also be that they are too high poker, they know that they have to try to keep their promises to reduce government expenditure and exempt the health reform.
These lines are already made clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and the increase of some taxes, the increase of the pension age and the reduction of state expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own assessment, so urged to put the deficit question to the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation, and they fight very much to get close to this number.
The largest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Board, as in financial matters, at least today, is little space or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages of fighting between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party conflicts when the Republican Obama challenges the state budget, the taxes and the health system, subsequently followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proved that, despite the partiality of the current choice, the majority of the Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads into a sackgasse, as has happened in 1995, then both parties must carefully pay attention to the public reaction.
Anyone who is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek a compromise.
This may indeed be a optimistic viewpoint.
Partiality and polarisation are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological clision between Obama and the Congress republics than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at his time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure pregnancy for a far-reaching choice in 2012.
Thus, many Americans may welcome the courtesy that this week is being shown.
But on both sides, there will be much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that continue to be separated from each other.
Transmitted US document portrays Moscow as port of corruption
The city's control is located in the hands of the "cleptokration" and it gives some of the coupling funds and the protection fee that it collects to the Kreml. Thus, in February, the American embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service exaggerate high protection funds so that they can keep their expensive standard of life in Moscow, says it.
They collect money not only from legitimated businesses but also from organised criminal bands.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its part of the money that the leader moves upwards.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly a proof that in the meantime it would have been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption claims over years, and he has gained numerous complaints against such charges.
In September, he declared a Russian television broadcaster when he was asked for a documentation suggesting that he was corrupt, "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has resulted in surveys.
But it is unusual that, as the Ambassador's report says, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard that this happens by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Government of Moscow to crime has led some to mention it as "disturbed" and concludes that the government acts rather as a cleptokrate than a government," the Memorandum says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "crashna" (a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means "dach" or protection), which extends over the police, state security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow Government Office.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the military are at the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lower stage."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues to say that the FSB is cashing money from the largest companies and arresting small businessmen from the police.
One source, says, "declared that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get the protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime) because they have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs is no longer as asked as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the money is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed before - due to the one or other precaution.
Medvedev has spoken several times about combating corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kreml with bags that probably were full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucracies," said Georgy Satarov, Director of Industry, a Moscow Expert Commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of violence, he says, corruption is indispensable.
Country-wide, according to Indem, corruption Russia costs more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranging to place 154 of a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "most corrupted".
The disclosure of the memo of the American message, which happened after Moscow's late evening, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of the faults of Moscow, it can also be an opportunity for the Kreml to claim that you solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angry to the discovery that American diplomates called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such unethical ways, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront with the past
In a weakly highlighted classroom with dirty and blurring walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him of the later Khmer Rouge Guide Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge against the government, long-term followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims public confrontation with people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia for the first time condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it condemned the former head of the famous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years' prison.
With each of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge Veteranen Alnlong Vngs grew, their efforts to reconcile and reintegration into the community of Cambodia.
"There is still a rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For her life was glorious under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of the wicked."
"It's splitting families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, estimated 1.7 million people were exerted or died of disease, re-working or hunger.
When the Vietnamese fell and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remains of the regime and his military flew to Thailand at the border of Cambodia.
Here they spread up to December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, disturbance.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla War from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation in Anlong Vng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement supported by the UN in 1993 led to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to go over to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh's prison, where he waited for his trial.
When their gods no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the crushing poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgical memory.
Although a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have only very little benefit from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds all over Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng, public forums
"They are anchored in the Utopian Agricultural Ideology of the regime."
"You grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old who joined in 1974 as a teenager of the Rhmer Rouge, struggled in the jungle for Anlang Vng before he settled in 1998 to live as a poor rice builder.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everybody something to eat."
"But now life is difficult because we have to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of the next year, the court will try to put Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, before the court.
The order of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the grudge acts, but it is not said whether there will be further actions beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to mitigate the fears of Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on In Chaem, 64 years of age, which during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s had been district head of Manteay Meanchey Province.
In 2007, she had told officers from the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she was conducting the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damm, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
On one hot evening, Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadow on the distorted grass, the Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court invited her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodja lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who flew from the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would more suspiciously charge, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodja has to dig a hole and buried the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means merging the broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken parts together so that everything can understand."
The Centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-sided "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an attachment to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Vng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are distrustful because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complex, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book, and the courts are gradually gaining influence," he said.
Still the Khmer Rouge has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, a managed by strainers leads an overwhelmed and with plastic waste devastated way to a rectangle of black rout, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here on a cap after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman at the street border, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go here to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place where she will put a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to collect non-violent uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for global security of nuclear materials, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer gather high-rich uranium, which is a critical element of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For years the U.S. government had tried to convince Belarus, not gathering high-rich uranium and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
However, officials of the US government told the Washington Post that in the last two months two secret agreements with Belarus were reached to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Natural Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they want a seat at the nuclear safety summit (from 2012)."
"It proves that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How keeps high-riched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally able to arm, and less enriched uranium," said Lukhenko then.
"This is our raw material... we won't make any dirty bombs from it and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first approach to removing the Uran Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly radiated, says officials.
It was loaded into a special train that has over 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal factory for, says officials.
The second call was decided on Monday and was carried out by aircraft according to the official.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, whereas most of the money flows into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and coordinated to build confidence", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Centre for Unallocated Studies estimates that in this year Belarus had at least 88 pounds of waffe-weaved uranium and hundreds of pounds of high-enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve its stock until 2012, according to the common agreement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States were tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenkos' harsh disrespect for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approximation.
"Welcome to the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announces that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key theme in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish Government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners across the Spanish state territory to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram of the U.S.A. ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents enrolled by WikiLeaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (per cable). It is added that the former Vice-President of the Government asked María Teresa Fernández de la Vega to inform the Spanish Government "to prove that foreign planes that are flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid to human rights practices was accused in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Vice-President of the Government confessed that the Council's report 'has taken Zapatero in the back' and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"The la Vega underlined that Spain has no objections to the secret service flights across the Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed", not to be "unprepared surprised," reports Aguirre via cable.
The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed to the ambassador that the Spanish Government would not like to give this matter great attention, although the government has little influence, as they are in the hands of the judges.
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González gave the message that he would not block the judicial initiative, the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Defence Minister on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador explained after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Yet, the United States was more concerned about the "serious coordination between the Spanish lawyer and the German lawyers" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle governments," complains Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, where the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba attended, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are incredibly concerned about their independence and do what they consider appropriate," he gave his employees instructions to "reflective rhetorical comments to eliminate the tension."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the procedure of the PP in this matter.
"Despite their general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from an indication that the government of Zapateros could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, tolerated or deliberately ignored, will hit capital, even if these revealings could have a negative impact on the government of the United States," he stresses.
The child murderer admits that she complained on the Internet about the "mouse" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog, "Terror in Galician manner"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname she leads from the little one she contacts with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand these, you need to know their love life, which reconstructs the daily newspaper ABC on the basis of witness statements of their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
She kept a year.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, she became known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his husband never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Soon afterward, she had a different relationship.
The elected one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighborhood.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearians to look around on the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they divorced.
In March 2008, she is on Menorca alone and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came to work."
"When I told him this, he found it good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free, to do and let what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get a address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If I don't like him to leave the boy with my mother, I'll get him back."
In May she speaks of the return to her village: "I'm going to go there this week, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th, because I have to imagine a job on the 20th day if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her firstborn when everything's fine.
"He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life I will leave him with anyone except with my mother," a doubtful intention when considering their bad relationship.
There is another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the first of the month and was supposedly murdered on the 10th day is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand, he is with me and the place likes him a little, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"Where he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for the child girl."
On 17.: Reminders and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. If he wants, you see, he finds me, so shit."
On 30 a.m., "The boy's okay. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
By Victor, her current partner, there is one: "He's putting me money."
In the Internet, in Anime and Mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had a own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison releaser".
"Terror a la gally (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, a defended hunting overseer, explains to have conscience bites because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica was transferred from the centre of judicial prisoners on Menorca to the province prison of Palma yesterday.
The obligatory defender, Carlos Maceda, explained that she couldn't remember the end of the case, "and she didn't intend to harm the little."
In the past, however, she had said that César was drowned in the bath and that her body had been stumbled in a bag.
Defence and prosecutorship requested a psychiatric advice.
Partido Popular won 4 seats at the Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in vote and parliamentary votes in the last regional elections, the PP already focuses on Parliament's elections - preferably or not, their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves at these elections is usually twice as high as those in the Catalonia elections.
Thus, the Catalan Volkspartei received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure in the 2006 regional elections was only 316.222.
On the last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the conversion of the PSC's vote and the binding of the PP electoral force - should stop, the PP's analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress Members, while also CiU four (the PP now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a member - at present it has three - while the ICV could hold or win its members.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date will be with the municipal elections in May 2011. Even the Volkspartei (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to bring an end to the socialist presidency, in four province capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists as well as the Volkspartei agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists will not reach a majority or have their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debakel, it is not abandoned that this party will lose its representation in Barcelona's Municipal Council, where it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP reported an increase in its vote in the four province capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's turning. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Aengel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election struggle they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels, or Reus, the Volkspartei also had a significant increase.
At present, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and strives to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell wore Al Qaida thousands of passports
Except for the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven politicians arrested by the Police Office of Barcelona's Police and the Nigerians formed the Djihadist cells controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "movement to liberate Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - last was author of the Attentat in Bombay, who demanded 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Minister for Interior describes these studies as important as it is so far that he assures that the "Operation Kampai" had been "degraded" with the falsification device Al Qaidas worldwide and "somely its capabilities".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they falsified and subsequently sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "fighters" could unlawfully cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The detected cell is not the only Djihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, other European police units, except the Thai investigators, have also contributed to the investigations. It is not excluded that in the area of the EU, in the next few days, there will be similar attacks as those carried out in Barcelona on the last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanian Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) a further in Thailand where the Pakistanian Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai countries Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok from the cells located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - was stolen in particular tourist passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 years old and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Research circles underline that until now no connections between the arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay could be demonstrated, although the author of this attack was "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the recipient groups of the travel passports stolen in Spain and then in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack of Catalonia from a money transfer company had been sent several thousand dollars, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", which ended the life of 106 people.
The police have captured a comprehensive documentation.
PP calls for a breakdown of the tax agreement by Mas
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present its conditions for supporting his office as Minister of Generalitat. These do not differ from those already in the election campaign and can be summarized with the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial balancing agreement which the regionalist leader wants to propose at the top of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas with the security that gave her the 18 Members that they won last Sunday - a figure that is more than sufficient to feel vital, because the candidate of the civil-regional CiU is required that at least one of the opposition parties will be invoked at the time of their vote.
The future alliances that regionalists want to join at the congress of the next parliamentary elections depend on a possible entrance with the PP. However, the discussions that Mas is conducting at the time with the other heads of the parties are about Catalonia.
As far as the PPC's chairman is concerned, it calls for the support of "all discourses relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on financial compensation between State and Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque country - and which the Head of CiU even wants to undergo a referendum.
Both political leaders are inclined to eliminate the built-up political apparatus of regional administration and to eliminate the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the entry of Mas are addressed from the sides of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Oldenpflegeheim confirms that deaths are not due to "defective measures"
The owners of the Old House in Olot do not exclude that their career killed over eleven older people
The officers of the old career house La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which they pointed out the harm of the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people for which he was responsible - to the establishment.
Joan Sala, the chief of the Old Carehouse, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced "La Caritat wants to accuse the person responsible for death", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability."
The institution must not only take a loss of social reputation because it had not established the career's crime acts in time but now also pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims of the family.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime is going back on August 2009 and that he has continued to kill since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients in the old care house - as he suspected that no doctor personally studied the dead, but the formalities of their age and diseases were by telephone.
The leader of La Caritat rejected this point round and explained that "resident measures could not have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the dispute there are no individuals for irregular acts of a person other than the accused."
The one who already was "Death Angel" who was baptized before yesterday, declared that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and had killed the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with a overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different calcium agents.
The leader of La Caritat explained that the access of the staff to the medicines is only difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the calcium cocktail used the nurse in six of nine crimes to liberate patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it out from inside, by giving them flavours, as he had admitted to it to three women who he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, there is no faith in the statements of the nurse, not even with regard to the number of survived murders that could be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before court and that it doesn't make sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available for this reason and for the purpose of enlightening the scope of these events of justice.
Drying of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded sharply to the threat of the President of the ECB Trichet yesterday, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
The risks of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB will be able to deceive itself and the euro has hardly devoted to points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market, which is to the extent that it breaks up again, but as a result of the closing of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to cancel our liquidity take-offs, which the ECB must make a withdrawal in the morning for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Federal Bank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of government debts, as they were ineffective, as well as the withdrawal of any extraordinary temporary liquidity measures. Only a week of unlimited access should be maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to extend "at least until March" and to maintain quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds will continue and give a stronger signal.
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets will be rejected from yesterday and if we are thoroughly persisting on taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Like at the ECB session in May, where the Bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of debt securities and to merge the markets thereafter, this story could repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot to provoke a new breakdown of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government's asset management amounted only to 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 base points in the entire curve and thus reflected a market perception change in the words of trichets.
In Ireland the numbers of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to approximately 10 000 million short-term and possible further 15 000. There is time until February to acquire private capital or to state these banks.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must receive Parliamentary consent to its new budget on the coming Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made its discourse on the summit of Heads of State and Government moderate on 14 December, where political unity is asked to show that we play the same lot together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish Government President presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, degradation of state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and employment measures. Actions that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis four seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish exchange has been added by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government loan that will benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we are applying to a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our reliability.
For Spain, the application for an aid plan would be a self-offering.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The treasure office has EUR 40 billion, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are very expensive and access to the markets would be closed without delay.
Yet, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now is not only the being, but also the shining."
Just courage, we can do that!
On request of his children, the Chairman of the Governing Board of Eulen contempts the Meeting of the Society of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owners of the societies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fool.
David Álvarez, founder of the company's guarp, will fight the company meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on request of five of his seven children on 16th, as he thinks it is "absolutely nonigible". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the wineuts Bodegas Vega Sicilia -.
David Álvarez and his children Jesus David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute to control a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not appear to be willing to give up in its dispute of jurisdiction to the control of El Enebro's institutions.
From the Board of Directors, he was driven out by five of his seven children, who appointed members of the Board of Directors at the Assembly of 18 January of this year, which has already been registered as an objection in the trade register.
The company meeting of El Enebro, called by the judge of the Trade Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunder in the shot of the family Álvarez.
The call of the judge for the appointment of the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the call of the Society meeting.
The last strategy by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to allow the congregation that was declared unauthorized on 18 January, by means of legal spits, fraudulencies and abuse", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the contemptation of the congregation in the afternoon to explain it as "absolutely none".
In June, the same protagonists who were in discreet silence tried to call a congregation in a judicial way.
In El Enebro - property company and holders of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of capital.
However, the founder of the service group demands, according to family protocols, the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter which the judge has to decide on in the hearing to deal with the dispute for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull ended in the world of formula 1, its history in this read univers is characterized by the speed of surprises and successes.
At the beginning, no one took note of the newling and, despite his steep rising arrival during the last season, all at the end of the track in November on the victory of Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without seeking to reduce the ability of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power strength of the Renault engine, the "Privacy weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands and thus created a victory team has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulation of processes that brought the German company to the market in 2007 for purposes not related to autorun.
This computer program called PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy works and high-precise instruments.
A reliable reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and overwhelming costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft and Nissan's most famous use vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that are identified on the races and in the tests.
Russian worm suggests that in 1992, averagely ten technicians worked in the race stations, which could introduce at least three or four improvements in a season.
In the Red Bulls team, 180 highly qualified young people are busy today. With powerful EDV facilities they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the racing cars.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the components of Red Bull’s race cars, except the engine for which Renault is exclusively responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality within less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team may spend for its races in a season.
Red Bull has built his high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his race cars in a 50 kilometers away from London.
It is two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The employee includes 580 persons, including the two pilots, the World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the huge technological resources that the Energy Drink Manufacturer puts in the services of its participation on the race routes, further protagonists whose support is invaluable and their knowledge is equal to zero are hidden.
Steve Nevey, the Chief of Technology of the Work, emphasizes that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in R & D for R & D contributed with 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the shares have changed. The technology represents 85 percent of success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Weber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "not predictable gladiators".
HP will open in two years twenty own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) won his first exclusive store in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty businesses with 80 to 100 square meters each, which is intended to open the multi in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the 16 existing sales areas in the multimarket business, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrro, named the reconstructed store at Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, which has been working together with HP for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales offices in Europe by 2010, including 20 establishments in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mrera did not want to betray the coming new openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The vice-president, also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for loading is always the same. It is based on a local distributor with experience and industry skills.
The North American company group advises this and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all shops will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrro said that it is not a Franchising system and emphasized that the exclusive sales site network is intended "to optimize the customer service and the advice of small and small enterprises during the purchase and afterwards, even to optimize the packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre of Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and private customers, because large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rival in three years to 'cloud' a million customers.
The executive board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the debt war.
Yet, he expects a breakdown of the interest rates that the banks are trying to compensate for with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - a section to exist.
Sabadell has found the way to spend the next three years and thus survive in a very complex economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guide plan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without taking advantage of the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000, when you take off the customers that will lose the bank -. This is the great challenge this bank faces, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share in private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers account for more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, speaking exteriority, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the Bank will be presented together with the annual accounting report.
Only a few banks dare set and publish goals in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has broken all the plans of the banks worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its guide plan Optima four years ago, which was initially based on three years, but as a result of the market situation, he was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola, 2011 would be a "tough" year "with great range".
The manager assumes that Spain would only come "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years "creating work" - essential for the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war is going to decline for liabilities - which are punished by the interest margins - the risk contributions that banks and savings banks need to pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity are already declined to the price for loans.
"The topics liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn off the chicken, but the interest differences are very high," Guardiola admitted.
On Thursday, Banesto already issued the order to limit the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest differences (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently persecuting the Stategie "to increase fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's guide plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporative businesses.
He does not at all assure that in Spain "greater companies are necessary."
"The next year everything will change," he assures.
He emphasizes that the need for capital is now increasing "normally" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions are going to break down in red figures.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in the case of capita lending.
After assuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closing of the markets, he disappears the argument of some bankers who already predict a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that there can be nothing in circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, you can obtain short-term funding through repo businesses and thus capture the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of savings banks
The CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a merger wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish spare funds began, several spare banks did not take part in the first phase. They kept the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, insured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. Cajasol's involvement in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was rather adaptations."
"The largest part is completed. It may be that we have twenty-seven or fourteen instead, but all the important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de España, who has supported all operations strongly."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of the Managers and Managers of Aragonien (ADEA) Olavarrieta, Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process was "finished as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limit, which was not now defined within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 spare banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 by 75 500 million is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the basic agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "a number of unrecognised opinions on the slowness of the process that revealed ourity and insaneness" because "Banco de España urges us to finish in time before the end of the year."
The CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, insured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "possibly" throughout the world and added that those who doubted this would do this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy we need to "no concern" about the situation of financial institutions and the savings banks that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also reminded the Spanish banks that the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July were very good.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time established conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustments, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, regulating time-working companies or lifting the 426 euros of support for unemployment aid, until the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports, as well as 30% of government lottery.
On the other hand, the Vice-President of the Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of the cansler Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How can these operations be understood?
It is premature that the position of Merkel is not a fault of their public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of re-defining the euro.
Germany takes a fundamental new perspective on our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the old-fashioned traditions of a large part of his partners.
In view of the opposition in Europe, Germany begins to speculate over three possible causes of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the German Mark - although it is more like Science Fiction at present - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Thirdly, a conversion of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the setting up of payments in some countries and the extension of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position has been clear and has been signed for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficit and the German Government took a constitutional reform from the Arm to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the conflict between what Germany considered necessary (true tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign sets the Central European country when Merkel pushed out the decision to rescue Greece painfully.
At that time this was strongly criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the published opinion was absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes to the new position with a clear position and calls for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to enable the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to oblige private borrowers to bear a part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it promoted the Irish crisis and all of the following.
But its proposal has been adopted, even if something is sweetened, and in the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that is not going to exceed it.
It says all that, even if unpopular measures are needed now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from that date.
In 2013, the birth year of a new currency area, in which the infringement countries can be severely punished, will be forced to declare incurable payments and, in this case, to take part of the costs of the private sector.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, metering consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and positive foreign salts.
The other alternative based on debt and building with huge holes in the payment balance, as it was indicated by Spain in Boom times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad about not understanding.
It is not just about reducing state deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulencies will turn into more peace.
And that we will use the possibilities that will be offered until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero also understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) suggests that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis, order in its own house, has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn't look like it would change something.
Under the possibilities considered, we must not exclude the euro area that has been fully stopped with a few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulations
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to cope with a sanction.
The predicted exclusion from two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game against the Ajax in the Champions League of November 23 led to a lot of ink about whether it was an unsportal act or not and whether both players should be punished by the UEFA.
As commonly known, the two players lost time a few minutes before playing (your team had already clearly won) and played several fols so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction at the next game against the Auxerre and thus without cards to the next play phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate on the case presented is that a team of the real Madrid football club (which in his hymne gives nobleness and honor and has punished his players for similar events) played the main role in this, and on the dramaticization by Mourinho, which added a episode more to his long history than theatral and provoking technicians.
In any case, the debate is about whether this practice, which is not expressly forbidden by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts are a rule-wide circumference; in fact, this approach is in line with the statutes of sport, but it seems to be the point of dealing with it.
In this case, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the infringing players from taking an unjustified benefit from the counter team.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand in false game or inconsistencies, because the circumvention of the rule was not executed secretly to avoid a sanction, but should be as noticeable as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited down and accepted the penalty with joy.
Another question is what kind of advantage the infringers took from the intentional fouls.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was not brought into a less favourable situation or advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with less players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, since the team could get out at some time. In addition, the players receive a sanction with this approach and go over to the second card cycle, where they are divorcing with a card less than in the first cycle because of cards.
This is not so clear whether it is really a advantage.
Finally, such practices are not against the athletic spirit, including strategic decisions to benefit from the rules as much as possible.
In this case, the players did not want to deal with sanctions (this would actually be a clear case of rule circumference), they would rather choose when they were undergoing this.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the limit between invention and regulatory environment is distorted, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemics were caused by two factors: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the kind of provocated regular transfer.
The damage caused by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offensive for customer catch for group Christmas evenings in Barcelona
The dictature of the calendar this year drops a lawn of reservations on the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are widespread. They do not want to spend more than EUR 20 to 30.
Like the Turrón and Christmas lottery, there are also group evenings that are due to the oxygen and recreational business of Barcelona. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they release a price-offensive in order to capture the customer segment that represents the large mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or evening, confirm the enquired entrepreneurs and associations.
In order to make the booking even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on one Friday) has dropped all orders to the week of 13 December, with the result of a lawine of reservations of dinner at two peakers (the 16th and 17th day), and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group evenings for budgetary reasons.
In order to avoid this tradition, many employees pay it out of their own bag.
As the economy is, lowest prices are demanded, confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona Guest Board, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the Dach Association does not dare to predict how the holidays will look this month.
"The people think about it twenty times before they book."
"They would like to go out, but they strongly pay attention to the prices," he emphasized.
The business will go well in those who will offer "quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and calls us in memory that customers save in crisis times, which is why prices are most demanded by 25 euros.
At a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it appears that the evening of December 17th the providers lead to the collapse.
The Soteras group says that the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be a tree. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, who has 16 guest places in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the property of the calendar has led to preferential reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for each taste from €19.95 to €30," he explains.
AN Grup, who leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQuu and a total of 23 locals, does not lose optimism, after the second quarter has blossomed the revenues again and good, even though it is seen for a few days concentrated prospects for Christmas business.
Sources of the company group highlight that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus. You have the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than the previous year and wish more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, green sprinkles are also seen sprouting, so the employees are invited back. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back in the weather.
On the sides of the Fecasarm Dach Association (with concentrations such as the Kneep, Restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusted to see the end of the tunnel and noted that the reservations in total are quite "viable", although the customers "empty a maximum".
The fun of celebration, however, has not gone back, no matter who pays.
The Pakistan Nuclear Programme causes great concern in the United States
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons " faster than any other country".
Disclosures of WikiLeaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department confirmed by WikiLeaks' Internet portal, the enormous concerns of the Pakistan Atomic Programme Washington.
At the edge of the clearing and soft details, which provide documents on the content of the conversations and the thinking of the accreditation of North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between two countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened, but, on the contrary, "reduces", and that the instable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistan Atom Program - that the weapons are not composed, but are stored in their individual parts in order to facilitate their destruction when possible - Washington prepares sleepless nights.
The ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists the following risks in a report before visiting the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones, "The nearness of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the likely distribution of nuclear material and the appreciability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and the missile programmes is considered not only by the United States but also by Russia as excessive and reason to let caution guard.
"Pakistan has to set up strict credible staff for the monitoring of nuclear plants; due to the low level of education and cultural organizations, extremist organisations have more possibilities to relocate people working on nuclear or rocket programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American colleagues.
The new documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan is releasing in nuclear proliferation and the increased speed in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, a office of the message, which describes communication with Pakistan as "fruitful", declares: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they are rejected."
In another communication Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic catastrophe of Pakistan, nuclear weapons produce as fast as no other country."
The ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit of the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify the responsible," that "Pakistan's army has to set up his silent support for terrorist groups."
On hunting for WikiLeaks Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to prevent new discoveries.
Interpol gives a red warning about the persecution and invention of Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth, in which things are only difficult to learn.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to "invention and persecution" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest arrangement.
In addition, she is not new, she comes from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse which the Australian must face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr Assange."
Already on 20th, the International Police Authority, seated in Lyon, France, issued the order on request of Sweden, but it was not announced by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after receiving the power.
This is how things are. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify Assangs and find out, "to arrest and deliver it in advance."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to the organisation, consider the red warning as a free letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where assignment is likely to stay.
Assang's lawyers, who published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
You also recall that Assange requested the trip from Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor who received the appropriate authorisation to the law-owned Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Head of Security of Stalin.
"This is like a hunting, not a legal persecution," is accused of the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother of Australia is devoted to the innocentness of her son - Assange stays at an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he interviewed the head of the magazine Time per Skype from an unspecified place. He asked for the resignation of the State Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the ordering of North American diplomats that spionate the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the United States, it would have to withdraw," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for withdrawal as "incredible and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should put value on the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the transmitter CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent new disclosures of documents.
The attempt of the speaker of the President of Barack Obama to give asangers less attention is in contrast to the views of conservative politicians and commentators today.
The Congres member Peter King, who will be chaired by the National Security Committee of the House from January onwards, invited the State Department to examine the possibility to put WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "to capture their funds and to pursue anyone who supports it or contributes."
Tom Flanagan, consultant of Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to "be murdered".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something."
He who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoeverever it was that let the government send information, he is guilty of betrayal and all that is not execution is too mild punishment," he explained to the transmitter Fox.
Puigcercós seeks with an eyepiece to the Carod Nearby Peace in the ERC
The Republican leader permits the party to vote secretly on its existence in the Office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the full Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to disappear for the fifth time of an internal restraint in the series of the ERCs, which have lost 11 Members and half the electoral votes.
The Chairman of the Party is aware that his resignation threat is not sufficient to the neighbours of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is weakened today as its mentor itself and will not make him the same head breakdown as other former streams.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with an eyelight, which would ensure his position until the next local elections.
At the beginning of yesterday, the over 200 regional Council members of the ERC announced that his remaining office could be secret.
With choice lists, not with lifted hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss a penalty to the presidency, they could do this without having to fear repressals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel with half of the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without indicating percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod nearby demands more by the President than just to make his office available to the party. An insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the Supreme Organ of Congresses.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Board of Directors a plan of action from now to May.
They are expecting to contribute to the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the leadership will present to the Council for voting on 18 December.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós. On the contrary, this is to promise to present the congress in the autumn of 2011, which the peak of the party already considers to be a fact.
The party president of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" damage to stability and seeks to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the official Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the chairman of the Party was supported "in exchange for different objectives".
He listed five of them, of which two are in the forefront.
First, the "restructuring" of the board to represent at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the involvement of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should end up giving up the full meeting principle as a function.
In this way, he fought a reform of the statutes which will allow the congresses to be held with selected delegates.
From the end of the full meeting model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which struggled for it at the last two conventions.
In fact, at the 2008 Meeting, the leadership of the parties was assigned to review the full meeting principle at a congress which should address the reform of the statutes.
This date is still out, since the internal restoration of the past years was not advised to deal with this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors, the time might have come to take this matter back and finish forever.

China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gases
China's representative explained on the COP16 that his country has made huge efforts to reduce carbon traces and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, insures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the United Nations Summit of World Climate 16 (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made huge efforts to reduce carbon traces and to convert its industry.
He argued that in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he explained that China would not change its objectives, but work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy in terms of climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, building capacity, building institutions and supporting pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the state had cooperated with those of the central state and the communities in order to achieve the energy saving objectives, effective use of energy and reducing emissions.
In addition, he concluded that some multiannual plans have been taken into account or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those received money from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced in the last five years and had received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and from private hands.
A project is also running at the province level for climate change, another for the exchange of traditional bears through energy savings and another for weakening and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government advisor on climate change in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China would be far greater than generally assumed.
He showed that the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tonnes per person, while it is 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
Similarly, unprecedented progress in energy use has been made. Energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent in the last five years and will be done by 2020, he explained.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former Panist Party Chairman has the right to refer to the National Rules of Procedure Commission and to demand what the right confesses to it.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party president of the PAN has the right to refer to the national order commission and to demand what the right confesses to him.
In an interview held before complaining Gabino Cué Monteaguados as governor of the state, he declared that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case in order to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not the time to think of 2012 and that an alliance to presidential candidates never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, where his successor is elected.
"This (a alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he explained.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back to 71 years of dialogue, so "does not scare us the internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the one or the best chairman, which Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, and therefore, he would overcome the Stafettes "to those which the Council would decide."
"I'm quite free and open. I would be proud to transfer one of the Five to the office of the chairman of the party."
He predicted that the last elections of July 4 will reflect the change of the party in the next elections, although "it is not time to think of 2012."
"Now it is about supporting the governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments, which came from Allians between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, were carrying flags and were observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and desires are put into them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the requirements."
When he was consulted about the criticism of the PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his discount course under his four-year government, César Nava called on the followers of the PRI to think about the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the safe," he confirmed.
He believes that the holder of the Federal Government can make expressions such as those he could make in his discourse in Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there was no mouth ban and even less a censur.
Obama is engaged in Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - Act, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," the President of the United States twisted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported national mobilisation to support the Dream Act - the Law on Legalisation of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - Law, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," said Obama.
His brief communication contains a Cyberlink to a more extensive document that calls on the public to come in close contact with its senators, as the vote of the law is immediately in advance.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was distributed after the 42 Republican Senators insisted on blocking all voices for each law, except the extension of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, which was announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
About the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, the president's speaker Robert Gibbs said he trusted that when the tax subject was resolved, a schedule could be set up for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement about this at any time and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
On Tuesday, the Chairman of the Democratic majority at the Senate, Harry Reid, announced that "he would apply for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - Act, with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from Thursday onwards, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the American dream law would legalize about 800 000 young people who emigrated into the United States when they were not sixteen years old during the last five years living in this country and registered at a higher educational institution or at the army.
However, the prosecutors of the Law need to adopt the initiative of sixty votes, which is why they are relying on the votes of a handful of Republican. At present, the organisations of the prosecutors of this project organize an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the Defence of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other democrats should decide to turn back to the initiative.
Among the most elected Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snow and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they could no longer support it at another opportunity.
Another Republican who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his attitude.
Although the representative house has a different version, the analysts agree with what the Dream Act in the Senate faces the greatest obstacles.
Put the finger into the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a walk where the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lingua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish language literature and used the subtitles of her question at this occasion (on another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "coming us into trouble," the Argentine scripture sweeted the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who gathered together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table that Marisol Shultz moderated by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela presented a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and the Shultz afterwards marked as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "worn" is, and from a doctor to a doctor from whom she receives no answer, but guidance for the guide of her story.
She is convinced to the infectologists: "Tolin is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who robbed her in the middle of the gang, and who explains her that wound is not a scientific term, the Psychoanalytic reveals the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the bow."
The main figure of the story facilitates and concludes that it "of the wound only learned that it really is open and not exists". But she is convinced that the desire for the language and its traps is mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story called 'Lob of Invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With plays on magic realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back far-roached men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn and reported of America, the great Roman who had not been missing from the beginning of his own chronists, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillao, who criticizes the overflow of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), spotted the contempted witnesses who showed up in the true stories, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with impressions that even came away with the shame."
However, he emphasizes that "the crazy and liars are the best to imagine things" and there they approach reality and lies, where one no longer knows what side the story belongs to, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls that the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the diversity of the interpretations to which the FIl’s invitation had contributed to the round table 'The finger in the wound'.
The cubanerin and Puertorikanerin devoted their contribution to the great wound of societal violence, which their country, like all Latin America, is, as a result of fighting for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained, after highlighting that literature is communication and binding that builds between the author and the readers, such as in a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer" hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-living world also the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness run out on dogmatism, and forgets, "that behind every confirmation is a small no and behind every denial a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nowancate: And nuancation often means to put the fingers in the wound and to distress those who feel much better when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in premature ideas without nuances, and also the mighty who prefer to split the world into black and white he noticed and invited to discover a sense of the letter.
Romano fights for his first track
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final games, he has experienced Ups and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duell between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end game, there are also two different styles set by their respective trainers, and their meetings marked by counterparts reflect in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeat in final games, he has experienced Ups and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has been well held, why this opportunity is of very special importance for him.
The Argentinian has played up with the Medaille to the second champion, he has remained a step behind the winners and surprisingly he has carried out consecutive final games with the same team.
The Sanist Stratege reached the first final game as a trainer at 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the wings in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duell that he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a backslag again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went undetermined after 210 games, but at the 11 meters he came with 3-1 forward and got two possibilities to insert his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again from the accident and free himself from the evil magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I dedicate, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," the taxman commented when you asked him about the lost endgames.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he assured to have learned a lot of it: "The only teaching we can draw from it is that until the arbitrator does not peep the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared with two eleven meters, and I believe that this is a doctrine until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by 11 meters shooting, he is not concerned, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at 11 meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular playtime, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense effort to keep the title in your hands, which left us something for this end game, and we hope that this time it will not come to it."
It is in Romanso power to no longer be a second champion and for the first time cost the glory that the titles bring.
The US amends the rules for the receipt of a visa
Persons must present themselves to the visa request before their consultation at the Consular Consultation at the Services; the costs will be reduced in this way.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying a visa in the United States Embassy and the Consulates are amended.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their discussion at the Consulate at the Services for Visum Application (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The staff of the ASC records the biometric data of the applicant, which are reviewed by the consultant before the discussion.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
Decrease the total costs for the settlement of the visa, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed.
The applicant shall provide only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the return to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with request (including visa for time workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to talk in the consulate, they only have to imagine at the next ASC where they present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the consultation in the consulate remain less time there than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay for the 26 dollar service charge.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the finding of life outside the earth
The North American Space Agency called on a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for living in the world.
The United States National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of non-earth life.
The foundation will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at the NASA seat in Washington by astrobiology experts. It is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was launched, the NASA assured that it would "present an overlooking fund for the search for outdoor life", which caused speculation of experts from other countries.
Discovery could prove the theory that in enemy environments that have been considered unresident, human creatures can exist. The hypothesis was raised that they could turn into intelligent living - as humans - when their living conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe found on the ground of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an area that was considered too toxic to all thoughtful forms of life, since the lake is strongly arsenic.
In any way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances are increased that there may be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolise the arsenal, according to astrobiologists, it has been proven that "a real life form, a second form of life, which is different from the one we know."
The Space Agency will inform the actual scope of its fund tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference.
At the conference, the Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on the Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) in question whether its chemical composition is similar to the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
The reform of the Organ Law on the Congress will introduce the two-party system, complaining.
The 60th period of law had just started and already installed an opposition block, chaired by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined themselves independent. The four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the start of the opening session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo were excluded from the reform of the Organ Law.
With this reform, they repeatedly, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there were two people, the same number as parties that control the convention.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency of the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties PRI and PAN with these reforms had introduced their political disposition institutionally.
He argued that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the schedule. They went out of the political will, and if they did not, they would again be unfair by both parties, which would end the opposition coalition.
"I come here (the opposition coalition), that's what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even consider taking into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia explained that there would be conformances with PRD, PT and Patrón and that there would therefore be a pluralist group.
It cannot be approved, he continued that the congress, after being monopolist, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the legislative reform that is to rule an eternal two-party system at the Congress."
"For the beginning, this group begins with five Members and they talk to other colleagues so that they can get more," explained the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT reported to PAN and PRI that the congress has now turned into a 'prote' for two.
"In the past it was only one party, now they divide it into two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and give them their place to the negotiations.
"The five who are likely to be nine Members must not be left outside because of the top decisions of five, which are likely to be nine, who are currently seen as divided into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because it has been reformed and distributed by the others, we remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 more peso for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
A further check over some 200 000 peso for the benefit of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical materials in the second half of the year is 1,200 000 peso.
According to the site for greater transparency of the city management, this check issued at a amount of 200.144,56 peso was issued with the number 9258447 last 16 November with the purpose of "calculation of open invoices".
The treasure champion Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent that more money from the community would go to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that is still guilty of her and therefore the number of cheques that are still issued to the benefit of Camacho Palazuelos.
"There was nothing bought with her, it's just paid the debts, as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appear" in the last quarter of the year "more": 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by the law, if a company is questioned by the ASE in order to prevent other administrations from applying for its services, the treasurer insured that its services would not be re-approved.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it was known that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year official period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques at Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam, where she added checks in value of over 3 million peso.
Tourist locations need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad state of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the invasion of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested special attention to the authorities, the areas that are in bad condition and throwing a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, reminded that at various occasions it was required to maintain the destination and to convert the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the roads and walking routes would have been negative, as the tourists would be able to climb and see the disorder, and then they would turn back to the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work in this way slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist’s crash would have made notice of the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work on the side of the city.
"The municipality must take over its responsibility and avoid doing this again. How to do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in the afternoon," he explained.
"We are eager to wait for a clean city, because not only because it is a tourism area, it must be maintained, also we inhabitants have a right to a clean living area. The city management must change their strategy to maintain the city in a good condition."
"There are other bodies that also look unpleasant and unfinished," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito from Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that cleanses its beaches and streets, and the tourist attractions are constantly shot," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given sufficient attention and this kind of incident is just what is evident for all: maintenance is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they were not used properly and made a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that had to be brought to frontman together with the city. Clean, ordinary and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that must be cleaned up and cleaned first to make them attractive for tourism and add them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP demands results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that the Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business industry calls for a dignified Parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was invoked. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM. This is a total of 40 people representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean work, feel obliged to the society and to the different societal groups relying on responsible parliamentary work and that they do not repeat the same pattern of partiality and patriarity.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the Coordination Council of Entrepreneurs CCE, suggested that the new Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the honourable Members really exercise their right to act free from agreements between the parties, because it is usual that they make agreements with which they represent their own interests, with which they turn into the corneval comparses of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure that they do a trustworthy work and put themselves in front of all things for society and their groups, because it were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Association of Hotels, believes that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 people representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, since today the economic situation is extremely complex.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will somehow promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism industry, he called on the new Members to allocate the necessary value in the state budget to the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the two most funds, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings exchanges and investment into the country and is in direct competition to the agricultural industry."
Tourist projects must be allocated to funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law which has not been re-established during previous legislative periods must be updated.
Holy King Is Searched
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys want the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family hungry.
For parents, it will be difficult for the next three-year-old to meet these wishes, because the household is not more and not less than 12 people and a goat bock.
Yet, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing that they so deserve.
The family lives a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from the hand in the mouth, because the father has no firm work.
"Sometimes there are hard times, because my husband has no job. But we sell mandarines and potatoes... I'm going to sell on the street in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a barbie pop.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has been looking for a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus proposes Cayetana clothes in size for one-year-old.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like this monster so much,' but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy, 'for it was very expensive,' Cayetana sadly remembered.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the 10-year-old Isaías has the size 10 during the eight-year-old Miguel size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple of size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realise the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Healthy King Is Searched' by spending a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 Country drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in the context of the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis, the ten house examinations in the Estrie administrative region were carried out.
Fourteen persons were arrested and will be charged with different charges.
House searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served mainly the drug production.
"Once 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of Haschish, cash and equipment that served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of Quebec Security Police.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are considered to be the primary drug-ring-trailer from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were supposed to have appeared in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest before the judicial building.
They could be charged, inter alia, with the accusation of the production of cannabis, whose property for sale purposes, the constituent and the service of crime.
These home examinations had been carried out as a result of a long-term investigation, which took place for more than one year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," explained M. Ruel.
About the 70 police officers of the regional detection unit Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke and the police authority Memphrémagog had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be easily persecuted
The draft law of the conservatives, which, according to the government, is intended to regulate the problem of ships charged with domestic immigrants, will be invoked in all the prospects after the three opposition parties have announced that they cannot support the proposal on Wednesday.
"I reject this Charter with emphasis."
"I hold with a party that put you on your feet," explained Michael Ignatieff, Head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session ended before the assembled Members.
The liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows to hold any sea ship that is identified as a person for the transport of illegal immigrants for up to one year, would infringe, as proposed, the Canadian legal and liberty constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, Chief of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the draft law, as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition partners are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," explained M. Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has declined the critics from the hand that demands that their party does not bear firm enough to the secret immigrants.
"The Neo Democrats agree to take action against blind passengers, and we are just trying to implement this by conveying another draft law, C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not support the draft law of the conservatives because he is seeking the debt of the refugees and keeping children caught for at least one year," explained Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties to play with politics and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians are urged to inform the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal transactions, which affect Canada and treat the country as a footbreaker."
"You expect Canada to take hard action," said the reaction of Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any voting of confidence regarding its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservator said to the QMI, the government would call up a vote so that each opposing Member will immediately declare himself to his electorate.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the formation of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister for Public Security, claims that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this topic last January.
The metropole has been a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Yet, the announcement of Wednesday has more than one surprise.
It must be said that, despite Robert Dutils' presence, this measure was not discussed at the least at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Party Québécois, qualified this announcement in pointo public security as "powered from the hat" as well as "painted at a tabler-adjusted solution".
Minister Dutil had turned back to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the questionnaire, future unity.
"You will see the result when we will announce it," he pleased to confirm.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest persists on preventing the education of this research committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the withdrawal of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and policy systems at ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this sackgasse, he proposes to Quebec to grant a special mandate for financial auditing to investigate corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the verification", he decided.
He also believes that Quebec of the verification control could grant the same power as Commissioners, which would allow you to commit people to say.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government's drawers.
The Quebec will also require by Ottawa to change the criminal law in order to be better addressed to this kind of crime.
This demand comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of the Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisdiction in this kind of criminal persecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister for Public Security, confirmed, his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently seized with certain novellations relating to this dossier.
During the Operation Printemps 2001, which took the groups of motorcycle policemen, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been novelled.
As a result, Ottawa has implemented the law against gangsterdom.
Fluids under strict monitoring
Several river runs continue to be strictly monitored because of the high rainfall that has occurred since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in Mauricia's administrative region, it came to an earthweed on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, there was another soil in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudier administrative region.
A street has been swallowed together.
From Tuesday on Wednesday evening, strong rainfall from 40 to 70 millilitres have been rainfalling on several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimetres of rainfall was expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the outaouais region were most affected.
Here, up to 100 millimetres of rain showers had gone down.
Since these rainfall are still the snow melts that have already accumulated in certain sub-areas, the overcome of several water flows is fearful.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service called on warnings about the high water alarm concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudier region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière are here to be the object of water monitoring and continue to be observed.
In the Lanaudière region, the violent precipitation of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Agree as well as in Rawdon has occurred.
In Saint-Calixte, the rainfall resulted from the strong rainfall.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the violation of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the Mansfield-et-Pontefract municipality.
The security service continues to be ready to alarm and monitors the situation, according to Annik Bouchard Security Council.
On Wednesday, the Quebec High Water Center issued warnings about the strong rise of several rivers, especially by Machineongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly corrected
The Quebec Rundfunk Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial relapse in front of the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of its controversial statements on social care and Haitians, as well as because of its outstanding speech on radio.
The CCNR believes that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 FM team, although the right to their own opinions, would have "unaccurate information on social care and unjust negative representations of the Haitians as well as such an uncompliant speech that is not appropriate to the day-to-day broadcasts."
The Supervisory Council had also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which involves the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide, would violate the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR received several complaints concerning the comments issued during the 2008 and 2010 period.
The first provision was made due to a complaint from the "Front commun des personnes assistées socials du Québec".
The Activity Organisation had complained that the amounts referred to in the consignment were inaccurate.
Instead, the moderators should provide solid as misleading information.
As far as the subject of suicide was concerned, Moderator Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide was an expression of humility.
The majority of the Supervisory Council members had concluded that the mediated message was that suicide could not be seen as a solution to life-crisis.
"The majority of the Board of Supervisors take into account that the implications of the "Dupont le Midi" mission in question would have been a sensitive topic in a family-righted and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not punished with any defense against his person.
The last issue was the statements related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective dispute in this respect that had resulted in a number of reactions.
The CHOI-Moderator had declared that he had not paid for the Haiti help, since it was not sure whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments had not been a mistreatment character, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already cut off my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
"My act has been virgin for a half years," explained the faserator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Council is pleasing to distribute an uncompliant expression.
In all cases, the CHOI FM has acted on the part of its commitments.
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, inter alia, had to communicate its decisions once during the main time of transmission within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal algeric origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlet, who is brilliant in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickboxes and in the Thai boxes, is now looking for new challenges on the Tatami and in the box rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports like Kung-Fu and Kickboxen in Algeria 12 years ago," Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008, explained to develop among the professionals.
I personally am looking for the fight in many places, because for those who present the soil struggle, like the mixed fight arts, they don't like, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, the UPS and the UPS employee who worked as a security officer had given bad news to his rivals, in which he reached two gold medals from the World Carate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) of Edinburgh, Scotland, held between 23 and 30 October.
"I gained the victory in the categories of full contact with Kickboxen and the Thaibox," he explained.
"I'm preparing for the World Pole in San Shou in China at the moment."
"They had been invited those fighters from each category who had placed among the first four at the last world championship."
"I babe in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"2005 I became behind in Vietnam."
"2007 I finished the tournament in China at the fifth place, while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth mentioning that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines derived from China, where footsteps and footsteps are allowed as well as grounds.
The two fights usually run on a platform, more rarely in a box ring.
The most renowned box fighter, which has come from this kind of battle sport, is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, who is well known in the world of battle arts.
If Nacer had left a single event in his career, he would surely call his presence here at the Super-Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This competition is the highest rank and most respected in China," explained the sympathic pounder.
"It's a little like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Once again, in the semi-finale of his category (80kg) he had won his first battle before then he lost in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four struggles per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals each meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the front to crown one champion, the king of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has in mutual agreement approved 450 million dollars to contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle Rupert.
In the middle of this law of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consists of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely the project management, to a sum of $295 million without an invitation to tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a follow-up to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector, to overcome its responsibility to overcome this important hydroelectric project at a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" supplemented the lucrative contract without a public procurement.
For the Party Québécois, the withdrawal to business consortia constitutes a serious ethical problem which disturbs the risk of diminishment of competition and a price increase.
"This is a new way of a carded game and deteriorates competition."
"This means that instead of doing carded games in a secret way in open form," said Sylvain Simard, MEP of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the public’s interest can be used in this way.
Minister for Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by saying in Abrey that this contract had been a carded game.
"I remain my line faithful," she assured by strengthening that the PQ was "unreasonable" and it" fails her hardness."
She said it's the least, that the PQ apologize.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary association that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise in terms of an offer for an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project shows a high level of complexity with regard to its workout.
The construction procedure is in progress and is to be established by 2012.
However, the Treaty was forgiven without a competition struggle; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception even in relatively simple projects.
The "Le Devoir" newspaper last week noted that the model of the consortium used in the field of engineering and consultancy is the subject of government surveys.
A short survival of the Quebec Company Register allows it to designate more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, the company Dieu works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, among which CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, or also Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozens of them, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Theseu.
As regards the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territorie of the Baie James is subject to a special dynamic workforce and that Hydro-Québec has paid this fact in particular since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has made the nose about the fact that the contract on the project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make an invitation and there are only few applicants, your prices will speed up to the height."
"You have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this march and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the persons," confirmed Laporte.
This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts over 50 000 dollars received by the party Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the "Le Devoir" newspaper was awarded more than 100 engineering and consultant contracts, companies or their branches, including, in particular, resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had made 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking part in their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They totally amount to $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were known to the "Parti libéral du Quebec".
Minister Normandeau had led to the fact that the PQ was similarly linked to the companies that they "financed" before she clarified that it was rather their leaders.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Green, but unwound skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but as little as the brands or eco-labels to control his choice.
Injury, although it baths in a media-effective universe, where information for a more responsible consumed consumer is only so violent: the barometer-conscious consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that makes itself known as the brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed yesterday.
Although they have advanced the consumption of so-called socially-compliant products in 2010, the Quebecs still seem to have little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admit that, in fact, to give little faith to the environmental commitment of the companies as well as the green business advertising, the measuring instrument expressed by the responsible Consumer Centre of the University of Sherbrooke reveals.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official, supposedly fair products, certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which declare themselves environmentally conscious, is the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently lived by only one third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, the empty and doubtful nature of the information damped the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer according to the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of the Quebecs face the declared performance of green products and services that they are endeavored to provide is suspicious.
According to another communication, over half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to barometers, they had also prefered 61% of purchases in traders of their city district and favoured the purchase of foods cultivated in their region.
Green and responsible conscious - the index of environmental conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, trying to reduce his trails left in the environment by taking care of animal protection.
However, the social and environmental consciousness seems to stop in front of his car, so the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecers have indicated, used public transport in 2010 or preferred the coach centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The footing and bike riding were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which eats the clinic performances.
State loans for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, who was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees with cooperation but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to overcome it again, does not seem to receive what they demanded.
Although the government has accepted the involvement of this matter, it is under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a loan at less than the initially hoped amount that could lead to a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least according to the sources of the state rumor.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected from Quebec last spring, the search for bits has been corrected downwards since then.
A proposal, together with an action plan, was already sent by the President of the Société de développement of the entreprise culturallles (SODEC), François Macerola, to minister St-Pierre, which is conducting the eXcentris act.
A few days ago, he had sent her a last case report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to answer this until 31 December.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems really to have been pressed to the side.
Remember that the Quebec ownership community of the cinema and the cinema complex had rejected against a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the minister of Culture has no financial assistance for real estate projects there , which he did not also have to come to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained against substantial economic aid.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had presented the author kino in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exemption from the state fund for over ten years after the own funded construction of the cinema.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to hold his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, operate a privately financed campaign, from which they hope a sum of $700.000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of future acquirers is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the presentation of the very successful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not cancelled the "Le Devoir" newspaper and has been ignored what he and his group hold from the corrected proposals made to them.
Secret of the complex shaken Canada ventilated
The new American diplomat lines spread by WikiLeaks raised the secret of what the United Nations consider under the Canadian Minority Complex to the Americans, but with the same struggle they open the sensation of superiority to Canada.
As a result, the American diplomas are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not mean the Canadian-American relations, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, provide even more pitched details than the only essential content you have to do.
A link dated on 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election campaign was in full, reports on the point from which the United Nations are no longer involved in the efforts discussed by their political bosses.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"An inherent minority complex in the Canadians may cause the Canadian political leaders to talk much more about the internal issues of everyday life than to postpone the United States to the black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, as he concludes, are therefore "the speaking Goliat of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him".
The ambassador understands this "earning silence" even less, since the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he evaluates, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party manager to conduct such an essential relationship that the elector has in mind as a key factor in the urn."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the communication sent by Terry Breese, businessman in Ottawa, sent on January 22, 2009, to President Barack Obama to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the continued existence of the government in the Confidence Vote on the Federal Budget at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has resulted from a survival programme of $30 to $40 billion," describes Breese.
He had never mentioned that the government had had to dismiss the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from falling by the coalition and thus affecting the continued existence of opposition parties to the quality of the proposed life programme.
A further communication dated January 2008 by Wilkin's Ambassador, Washington agrees with the increasingly negative picture that the CBC-rays spread dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about shipments such as borders, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle plays to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or also deductions for the purpose of entertainments carried out by the CIA's muscle prots.
Another communication reports in detail how Hillary Clinten asked her French colleague Bernard Kouchner to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo at their first bilateral meeting.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "the State Secretary has issued a paper in puncto Omar Khadri, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the act again."
Finally, let us note that the minds are warming up with regard to WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely standing consultant, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "merged".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly one third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction obligations of industrial countries.
After the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKWs given to the earth due to lighting if the white glowing bears, which are still representing a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better, with light diodes (LEDs).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the world's Fuhrpark.
Last year, in Copenhagen, the large exhaust centres such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that would reduce the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance sheet, 5 Gt should be deducted to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent it from exempting control.
In the white glowing bears 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent lamps, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED fluorescent bulbs it is once again reduced by twice.
The compact light bears hold between 6000 and 100,000 hours in average.
The new LED bears, such as those that the manufacturer Philips marketed this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-glowing bear, which means an indication of the savings possibilities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
Besides the fact that these completely new glowing bears give very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bears have reserves, as they contain mercury and that they must be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for producers, a place of adoption is available.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent beers, but rather the coal power plants, which are much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-glowing bears.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants run out 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
In detail, the report presents the profits that each country would gain thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually when buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Elfenbeen Coast Expected exciting the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "inappropriate" publication of the results of the Elfenbeen Coast presidential elections directly after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral Commission to receive its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a press speaker of the UNCED.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibility and to hold each initiative until the preliminary results are announced."
Despite the pressure exercised by certain foreign governments, the electoral Commission had expired the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed in television that the Commission would "continue the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have become loud, but CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and its opponent Alasane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo-Lager is expected to cancel "fraudful" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the Ex-Rebellenlager of the Forces nuvelles (UN) during the failure of the pussy in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Head of the Elfenbeen Coast Presidency campaign, had confirmed that the UN's practiced manoeuvre for the intimidation of the electorates in the north of the country had shocked the President's followers to go to the election.
The whole choice could be cancelled if the complaints submitted by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo Contractors are now more of the opinion that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north, who dismisses any connection to the ex-rebels, has considered the delay in proclaiming the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His alliance parties confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results as he knows he has lost; and submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the electoral Commission has been prevented from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crown of the association and reconciliation process of a country that was divided into two parts over years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible in the event of any excursions.
Laurent Gbagbo had enjoyed the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes compared to the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, which brought public support to former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rates remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is 9.3% (with the involvement of the overseas departments of 9.7%) in the meaning of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, according to the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Insea Statistical Office.
The unemployment figures in the metropole set up to 2.631 million.
The data of the second quarter were 9.3% of the employable population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the overseas departments.
Over the year, unemployment rates increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million employed persons were not employed, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were able to use every two weeks or not or whether they were employed or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropole (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% in the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of young people aged 15 to 24 years of age were unemployed according to the IAA.
The older ones have seen a slight increase in unemployment rates of 6.4% in the metropole (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6%, including overseas departments.
Only 25-49-year-olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1% point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion on its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office has no longer published the monthly unemployment rates since 2006.
However, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Region Bouches-du-Rhône (PS), a investigation procedure was initiated and he was sent into prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation procedure on public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of destruction of societal assets, distortion of general goods, healing, misleading in corruption, unauthorized coupling and arms possession, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and is planning to express himself on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him instead of spreading brains."
"It is easy to submit a number of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove it," explained his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, Brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialist) in the Department, had been emphasized to give the judge a memorial to his justification before his hearing by his lawyers.
A family Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than his deposit he had to run.
With regard to the business competence area or the target of the associated fund, he would never have been aware, says Simon.
In this Affaire, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of Aubagne, was also charged on Wednesday for detention and complication, but then under the order to retain away under judicial supervision by the protagonists of these acts.
"My client was able to make an explanation of the facts that were discouraged to him."
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to rob his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and released from prison on Wednesday in the night of Tuesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to the vice-president of the Supreme State Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, vice-president of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) disposed of by "unauthorised influence and passive mutation".
Two State officials of the Aubagne District, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Interruptation and distortion of general goods by a public service officer", the other on the basis of "contribution in the event of contamination of public funds".
The companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and destruction of social assets".
Among the persons faced by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned by a similar affaire of fraudulent acts from public hands that had affected Corsica.
The flags suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for mutatis mutandis fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the disposal sector, is carried out in April 2009 due to anonymous letters in the documents of several open investigation procedures.
It is noted that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the grant and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as to certain cities of the Marseille city departure area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palast overrides its intermediate function for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran for "Spionage", the French public in breathing, put diplomacy into alarm preparedness and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
This is all under the attentionful views of the United States diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and viewed by the "Le Monde" newspaper give some reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, which went to give these advice to deal with their own crisis of hostages in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officers tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French girls did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and of the American justice due to trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they set the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reis, in a grey light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 has the title "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée consultant in strategic matters, interviewed Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and Middle Orient with the American Diplomatin Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained her the French method.
They advised the Americans to put everything in place to return their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without submission" the words "Grundmens' Rights", "Innode", "sofort release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because "Stillwives do not solve anything", beyond the discussion attempts on unconceived ways, the Iranians are "master in excursion manoeuvre".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common, Iranian tactics" "gissing for political depression".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reis from prison (which was to come on August 16 on the day when it fled into the French message) "require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 Euro Guution).
And he lets credible, the Elysée anticipate further hostages, a phenomenon that "will sharpen."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reis has been released from prison 12 days ago, but is still held in Iran.
An information was brought into circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery the United States demands from illegal trade with sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison after a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, who pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
On 4 September, François Richier assured that this was not the case in the event of a reconciliation with Kathleen Allegrone.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "greatly surprised by the decision of the judge", but also tried to reject itself.
"There has been a rainy exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under the "strength" supervision of the French Secret Service.
The Elysée consultant chooses a phone number, re-covers, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "occupys at the moment in the buildings in Paris, which are led by the Iranian Embassy".
During the conservation of Clotilde Reis in Iran, the Elysée does not save his efforts to make "refuge attempts" by announcements and organized by the media, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruits, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated on August 25th, 2009, insists on the "Media Flits of the French authorities".
What is based on so much "thankfulness" to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy wonders.
"Despite their explanations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vain idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that the Elysée has brought to an end to this fiction.
He analyzed the intensive communication efforts "to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening against Syria".
A policy launched in 2008, which then "was considered early and undeserved by numerous criticism votes in France and abroad".
"The Syrian role upbuilding" Paris tries to "Train Syria in mind what rewards can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "save interference between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier had confided her: "Of course we don't know whether the Syrians had done anything."
"But we thanked them despite everything."
"This should at least create confusion with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reis returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elysée.
In a communiqué he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countryman".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "the ashbredle", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight, by blocking their access, so indicated government officers.
A draft law to call on online game operators to reject young people under 16 years of age after midnight, will be presented to the Parliament in December, depicted representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with learning in school and also with living a normal life throughout the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and the right to sleep," explained Jo Rin, with this draft law responsible ministerial officer of the French Press Agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 p.m.
The producer companies had a year to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government is also inclined to ask the manufacturers to cut down the time limit given daily for access to these games to young people whose parents ask for it, the responsible added.
It will also provide those who wish to make free programs available to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet usage.
The country is also unattached champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea, compared to 58 other nations, had acquired four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the country of designation
In a bright excitement due to corruption suspicion, the Executive Committee of the FIFA appointed the world championships' countries 2018 and 2022, a highest political choice in which the ranking of influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is sure: the edition 2018 of the Royal discipline of the FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic; the International Football Association hopes that after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, new territories (Katar, Australia) will be able to win for itself, or its establishment in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of individuals belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Sokrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) indicates the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship.
Thus, the makeups behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult otherwise to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) records offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the explorations with the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also have ruined the opportunities for their own country, weigh of the football, which could only take out the world championship one time, namely 1966.
The BBC had re-established on Monday by sending out a documentary report which took three influenced members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to angry the FIFA and to bring the English officers into embarrassment, which had mainly been lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The Head of Government is hoping for a re-examination of the chess train succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who achieved the organization of the Olympic Games 2012 in 2005 for London.
Would this intensive effort be sufficient to re-evaluate the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Duo Spain Portugal does not lack drumps with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could weaken their ambitions.
The possible repressals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal make Russia’s opportunities, which, despite its gaps in the file (Stadies, Hotels, Transport) becomes weighty outsides.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to appeal to the unwonderful reconciliation of the English press's objections "a unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the Members of the Committee.
"You're assaulting them with a bitch, you're trying to compromise them," whirled Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic power, headquarters of FIFA, the country seems to have a long list of advantages toward Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates seem to be early for two countries who had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the approval of the WM 2026 of the FIFA for China, which will cause the Asian Chances to fall to 2022.
With Australia and Catherine, who had all registered with the arrival of futurist stages, the FIFA persecutes its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk, for certainty.
Australia could, as well as Japan and South Korea, suffer the sensitive nerve of the FIFA, among the weaknesses of television rights (due to time shift).
Second mandate: publicity
The Gaulle had really supported.
Midnight had made him think he was stumping.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least toughness.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current Head of State will be Ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not a good face to the side of the mystery that holds the Presidency function.
So you have to act as if the doubt was in the future.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, the adherents Jacques Chiracs declared that a third mandate was not excluded without believe in it.
On November 15th, Nicolas Sarkozy insured in a serious tone to make his decision "approximately in the autumn of 2011".
That he would make the perspective of "two mandates" in the Elysée on Tuesday evening before the UMP parliamentaries had therefore spread a little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Very missing.
The President only reminded that the 2008 Constitutional Change limits the number of five-year official periods to only two.
He made a finding, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election at the time of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or best, if you're worse," he explained to them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the phase afterwards."
His words from yesterday make him no longer a candidate than in the past; but not less.
If they should make comments, then for a dual reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidature with the PS on one side.
But it is not the introduction of competition with Ségolène Royal, which moves Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidateship in 2012 that encourages many members of the PS more early than accepted to fight.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the right voters would prefer a candidate of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP on it," reacted immediately and carefully the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he would be a defeat as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," notes Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in becoming able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has found himself with open knowledge.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government documents
The last meeting of the Central Bank Council of the ECB last year should offer an opportunity to show how the crisis comes out, or at least announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy that will end the year.
The crisis of European government debt requires that the Central Bank in Frankfurt can no doubt afford to confuse the current more than stressed situation on European borrowing markets in order not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be too high.
The French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in the resolution of European government debt at a press conference yesterday.
She has not dared to say whether she believes that the Central Bank could do more, for example by stimulating its programme of purchase of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had shown itself in Brussels on the previous day when he was consulted by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, not very speaking about his projects, but rather reassuring that the programme of purchases of government documents on the secondary market would "extended" and that we will "look at the meeting on Thursday, as the decisions will take place".
Only certainty: The ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s treasure chamber’s bond purchases were doubled to approximately EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And according to indiscretions by some dealers, they should have made new purchases on Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
Totally, the Eurosystem's central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
The anticipation of a follow-up of the purchasing course is no doubt among traders (see page 29).
The peoples are already expecting no more remarkable change in courses.
If the borrowing transactions of over three months will already be disappeared from the ECB Arsenal, the latter will be able to create the unrestricted cash reserves in a free manner, over a period of one week up to three months.
The peoples are already concerned today that this measure will continue to expand for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
"In other words, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in a short way," Michael Schubert suspects, Volkswirt of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," he anticipated Norbert Bretts, Volkswirt at Sal.
Upenheim.
In the area of their interventions on the market of State debt, "the ECB would maintain such a purchase volume of bonds that live the carrying market", adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the European banks’ exposed position on the markets of government debt in the Eurozone, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter the market at any price to the places of the missing investors and act like this in order to prevent the fast enthusiasm of return paid to the weakest countries," proved yesterday an important obligation holder.
Because if interest rates are applied to high-level flights, the States would be even more obliged to reduce or just stabilise their debt.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Government of Berlusconi is in Italy
After a week of disturbance for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the decline in the rectangle interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the President-in-Office of the Region, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "indisposable" and heard it expect a "unforeseen" weekend, which the subject immediately declared.
In any case on Tuesday, the sharp interest rates had reached its record of 210 basic points, and the prices of the contracts covering the bankruptcy risk were increased to 263 points, which had resulted in a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out in his Council that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates is 400 base points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had, however, expressed itself as "toughly concerned" by the "market turbulencies" and a possible risk of infectious disease from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at Hudson Institute.
In the plain text, that is, his problem is the decline in economic growth and the resulting, swindy tax revenue that threaten the State to no longer be able to cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Recently, an Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although it is estimated to be 1.3% or 2% in the Senate to examine.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will be 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to the 3.9% predicted by the governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the restoration of a new budget collective that could be used after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"When necessary, new savings must be taken," says the auditor Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The basic festivals of Italy's economy are okay and its accounts are regulated, which we have repeated for a long time," insures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, which is responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"In the moment there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, since, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D. R.), there are lower stabilisation progress demanded by Italy than by other countries," Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD headquarters.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be faced with a mistrust proposal from the Chamber of Members, which would allow the preferred elections to be organised at the end of March.
So there is a slightly favourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think of the development of the anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had highlighted it in a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think it was proven on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans are clearly together, ready and engaged to defend their currency as well as their currency area."
Although perfectly relative - the decline recorded yesterday at the interest feet of European government bonds was water on the governments' furniture as well as the ECB.
However, from the beginning of normalisation, it cannot be spoken yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that they could reduce Portugal's debt note, probably the most effective target disc of speculates today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perception, which is particularly loaded on banking systems," says the opinion of Exane GDP Paribas people.
In particular, since "the political time goes much slower than the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this climb and the danger in it, intensify the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected financial ministers and, in the further sense, with their G20 counterparts are well advanced.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroups and Ecofin at the beginning of the next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the plan, the disadvantage of the unconventional measures to reinforce the countries of the Eurozone is in the cross-border of the markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started its Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in Fernost about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he will surely prepare the terrain for it.
The EU Stability Fund's first recreational expenditure is intended for the next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had entrusted, the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the first countries, are responsible for implementing structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be added to the savings measures, but should show effects in the nearer future.
Lisbon and Madrid do another way than Greece and Ireland did.
Both the one and the other are to avoid, at any price, the need to ask for international assistance before they have set up their own budgetary corrections and decided on necessarily structural reforms which bring them to their confidence indefinitely.
The European investors, on the other hand, are talking about the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of government loans markets.
Axel Weber, who was on the trip to Paris on November 24, had first produced the idea that if the 750 billions of euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back to his own bag.
The peoples of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market in European government debt, judge that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, " preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity price.
This means exists: the European mechanism of dotted financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
A advisory board that has all the chances to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions are at stake.
Snow and glitch: 24 departments in alarm level orange
Snow episodes still cause transport difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of the Bretagne and threaten to impair various economic activities.
Four and twenty departements are now in alarm level orange due to the threatening snow and glazing risk.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in an alarm level of orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow viewers are tangling the north of Gironde as well as the charentes, it sniffs easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, as well as from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is considerable enough to cause traffic barriers and to impair certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are locked for heavy transport of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac transport axis.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in the Bretagne is very difficult, according to the transport politicians who refuse to use their own vehicle only in emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In the picardie, school traffic for Thursday was suspended.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires the car drivers to be careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) urged the airlines to eliminate 25% of their flights from the Paris airport Roissy on Thursday and 10% of the flights from Orly due to the expected strong snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that the passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in south London as well as Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are locked until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy in the Ile-de-France is in full, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is intended to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, will be recalled.
In order to lead the SGP’s start into the way, the State has called for a capital deposit of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical form, this is the sum which the SGP would then allow to grant a part of the financial sum to its two-fold on the markets.
Today it has finally come to first high-calculations.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, shall contain the measures planned to raise the first part of these funds.
This is two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on the opening and higher taxation of the offices at Ile-de France.
First of all, Article 15 of the Legislative Draft is taken from the Société du Grand Paris Public Office.
This is figured: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
Secondly, a reorder of existing company taxation is: "to modernise it to increase the product resulting from it and to overcome this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A puzzle.
This sum is not mentioned in the text.
One of the 4 billion is far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources are allocated to the 4 billion euros of capital debt, which are raised by the State and the Société du Grand Paris are now and again provided for the project," the explanatory presentation is to be taken.
The SGP does not find this system stumbling at all.
"From the moment of booking revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projection for over three years and then only create from the 4 billion," explains.
"This is noted in the budget and deducted gradually".
The SGP suggests that 2013 will begin to list the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four promised billions will still be able to look for for a long time, is at risk of creating a quite moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rail-like hackers and loose spiones
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, it has disappeared as an obvious scandal, a scandal, which is just a scandal in the sense of shine holiness, which governs relations between the states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at international level and gives a prime taste on the future dominated by regression.
But let's go the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any act (an x-any nation) created by a secret service consists exclusively of newspapers.
The "extraordinary" American disclosures about the sexual habits of Berlusconis do nothing more than what one could read for months in any X-any journal (except those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the terrible caricatured profile Gaddafis has offered cabaret artists material for their skeetches for a long time.
The rule that the secret files may only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotherical publications, you will realize that every work (over the Gral, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or Rosenkryssers) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not the only reason why the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (now that he did not know where to find news about the non-existing) but because those who devote to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Like the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and faul (or restricted mind) is also the head of the secret service (or otherwise he could be anything, for example editor at Libération), who only considers true what he recognises.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American message in Rome had sent to the State Dezernat, was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a revocation made about the disclosures of these files?
On one side, they say what every trained person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have, with the exception of some small representation tasks, transformed into spionage centres.
Every arbitrary viewer of research films knows this very precisely, and it doesn't happen from arrogance that you do so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly hurts the task of shine holiness and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-any hacker can take on the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major struggle against the presidency of the state dezernat.
In addition, the scandal is less distressed with the victims than the "sharffriends".
But we devote ourselves to the deep-grunting nature of what happened.
In the past, at Orwell's times, you could bundle all the powers like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy since then could have shown itself as perfectly correctly where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, every transaction performed, the visited hotel, the selected motorway, and so on; the citizens would become the total victim of the eye of power.
However, if you look forward to what happens today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a vengeance of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
How, though, can a power that is no longer able to preserve its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is essentially a secret free of secretis, since it awards the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this infringement that have been added to such a powerful power?
It is evident that in the future, the states will not put any reserved information on-line anymore - that would be the same as a hang-out attached to the street corner.
But it is also evident that it is forgiven with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports secret through the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a head of State has moved in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relations, and only for certain ears, be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction is currently sounding after science fiction and romantic, but I see it necessarily necessary to imagine the governmentsagents, moving secretly embraced on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their communications nowhere other than in the only memory, and also hiding the few written information they received in the shot set.
The information would be stored in one copy in closed drawers: in principle, the spy test of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer today, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionated the communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegrapher with (phone) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for tape by evacuating from back to front and lifting all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs today allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
With the high-speed trains, you will travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by aircraft including the rise.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policies and communications technologies return to cars and horses.
A last observation.
In ancient times, the press tried to understand the secrets between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France beautifully speaks his financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the rapidly solved financial promises (also called "Fast Start" or early funding) that have been implemented by developing countries.
And already, the grove French beauty are discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed themselves to deliver 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million a year).
At the time of opening the COP16, the EU has drawn all registers to convince its partners of their commitments to fast-start funding: detailed approach report of their Member States, press conference, major adjuvant events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and estimated at its actual value: the developing countries and civil society are pleased to see if all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which brings it to the right way to respect its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen Treaty in order to ensure that additional efforts have been made without being sufficient to the disadvantage of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guide value he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen a guide for those of 2009: international funding will be maintained and will give 150 million for over three years in the context of funding "Fast Start".
Other countries have chosen similar guide values, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France believed that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
Otherwise, there are no guide values for the expenditure of the previous year or at global level of public development aid.
Concretely, the total total of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or also decline) - France claims to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule about it yet, and everyone chooses his calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are € 1 borrowed as equivalent to € 1 donated.
Obviously, this is only difficult to accept: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments (often related projects based on the most efficient technology), it is fraudible to present the euro that is acquired as equivalent to a euro spent on the market, and the cost of the loan should be counted as a commitment to the capital donor country (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
However, France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking up 91.5% loans (389.8 million) and spending 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the EU's only country where loans are largely used.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including) fulfilling their commitments to 100% with donations.
Otherwise, if the large majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France only gives 10 cents and understands a similar use among them.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
Everything in all, France operates in its fast-start funding with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial use.
France is able to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with his promise, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrations) could lead to a double negative effect; once the EU-internal (why are the other Member States going on with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely bluffing...
The chapter of early funding is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the overall discussions on climate.
But there could be too much drop in the immense machine of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from early funding this first year.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its booking type for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and the compensation of justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward discussions on the object of long-term financing (a different, crucial and currently discussed issue): it does not escape the question of "reliability" or the type of booking of its loans.
France could change his position in order to be as progressive in the disputes as it is in other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement of the fast start of France and its vision of "reliability" and the use of loans would naturally increase from the international trust basis, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alert - pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes up various chemical substances over the day 81, so a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (ehemal movement to protect the rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "because of the small number of analysed samples do not represent a statistically significant value, but Illustration Characteristics of the treated problem" between July and September had bought the foods consumed normally within four, from a child about ten years of age at meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined as well as nozzles from laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is low-saturating: 81 chemicals, including 42 as possible or likely to be carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrinine disturbance factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"If, in the nearer overall cases, the legal limits for any chemical, individually intake substance are not exceeded, this survey is very well considered that the reality of the consumer’s potentially carcinogenic substances or substances exposed to an endocrinine disturbance is exciting," notes the association.
Already at breakfast alone, the butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially cancer-saving residues and three safely proved to be carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an interim meal for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a ban on fungicide in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study has identified traces of an insecticide that is strictly prohibited in the EU.
Also, the hack steak, the tuna from the bulbs, even the baguette and the chew rubber of pesticides and other chemicals were spiked.
At the steering water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 chemical residues was on the "richest" and even the plastics used to heat the meal in the microwave was not loaded.
The final risk of this "injury cocktails" for consumers "is likely to be underestimated," the study states.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has, on its part, proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the increase in civilisation diseases.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
