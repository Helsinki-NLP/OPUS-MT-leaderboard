Politicians in Wales fear to "like fools"
Some members of the Welsh National Assembly were distressed over the proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament (Walisian Parliament).
AM's from the entire political spectrum are concerned that the change of name could cause a ridiculation.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because "the rim on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Walisian means twp fool, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Walisian conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fools).
In this context, the Walisian letter w is expressed in the same way as the letter u is spoken in Yorkshire English.
Assembly Commission, which is currently composed of a legislative proposal on the introduction of the change in names, said: "The final decision on appointments that Members of Parliament will receive is of course up to the members themselves."
Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals where there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Walsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AM, the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament members (walisian parliamentary members) or WMPs, but the MWP option was the most supported in a public consultation.
AMs seem to suggest alternative options, but the struggle to achieve agreement can prove difficult for the Chairman of the Assembly, Elin Jones, which is expected to compile a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The proposal for reforms contains other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on discrimination of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs are given the final vote on what they should be called when the legislative proposal is debated.
Macedonians shall vote on the amendment of the country's name
The voters vote on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is held in an attempt to resolve a decade of conflict with the neighbouring country Greece, which has their own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their Northern Neighbourhood is a requirement in the territory of Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says that he will subscribe to the vote.
Adherents of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a price paid to become a member of the EU and the NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stay quiet while the churches of Harlem fight
"The older people I've spoken with said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today there's no part."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People socialize in other ways now in days," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the quarter's daily rooms where people go in on a daily basis."
As far as churches, he is concerned that the money collected on selling assets does not last long, and that they are "before or later back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who do not help the quarter's returning places.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy owner apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development where these churches finally close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the property will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who was standing at the top of a boycot of shops at 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote black.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building severely, but when Father Johnson’s family children planned to restore the building, they ordered the watch game.
The priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and follower in St. Martin's, called the proud bell game "the poor's bells".
The expert who played on the watch game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a unreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first watch game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has been done in St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs. Some of them collected by the church leaders, others of the Bishop.
In July the Governing Council – the Leader of the Society, composed of leading doctors – wrote to the Bishop's judgment about concerns that the Bishops' dominance would "will try to push the expenses on" to the Congregation Council, even though the Congregation Council had not been involved in hiring the architects and entrepreneurs sent to the Bishops.
Some of the congregation members complained about lack of transparency from the side of the Bishop.
Hai damages 13-year-old on diving trips after lobsters in California
A shark attack and hurt Saturday a 13-year-old boy when he diving after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack was just before 7:00 in the vicinity of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming on help and then with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just enthusiastic to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I was biten!
I was biten!"
"Heal his crown was revenged up," said Hammel, he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water, there is a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was flying to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in a critical state.
It's unwise what kind of shark attacked.
The life saver Larry Giles said by a media letter that a shark was seen a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic damage on his upper torso.
Officers closed access to the beach on the distance from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security purposes and for investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 hajars in the area, but that most people are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take up the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants like storm gases.
As part of a great effort to take the UK's beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products fall. The larger rows of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several shops next year if they prove to be a success.
Investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets are looking for new products for shelters previously used for television, microwave and housing products.
Sainsbury's says that they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including labels such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing varieties from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with fired areas like those you see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relancers the range of Boutique-makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for veganians – something that is increasingly required by younger shopers.
In addition, the parfume shop Fragrance shop is located in two Sainsbury shops. The first one opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later in the year.
Online shopping and development against purchase of small quantities of food daily at local buyers means that supermarkets must do more to make people visit them.
Mike Coupe, Director of Sainsbury's, has said that the shops will look like storm gases, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introduceing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sale of daily goods and have made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempts of the supermarket to update beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early centuries, but cooperation ended with a dispute about how the earnings of pharmaceuticals were to be distributed in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmaceutical chain with 281 shops to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a further range of luxury care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and device of our ranges of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues, who will be available to provide advice.
Our selection of brands is designed to meet all needs and the intake environment and the practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "rassing", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
The Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones left "rassing", after the TV host Holly Willoughby subtracts from agreement to EUR 11 million with his lifestyle fire to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their living product and accessories fire Truly.
The company had been compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire.
This morning host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones angry after she has withdrawn from their lucrative lifestyle fire in the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "rassing", when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to 1.5 million GBP – meant that she no longer had enough time for her living product and accessories fire Truly.
The company had been compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of 11 million GBP.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left Truly, while Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday apartments.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project to deal with the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a stock full of goods in Marlow's headquarters that are already ready for sale."
Experts consider that the issue of this Morning host, one of the highest earnings stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company more than millions because of large investments in products – from puffs to lights for clothing and housing products – and the potential for further delays in launching.
And it can also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and houseman Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the Governing Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to be a brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin who has been on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business actions."
Hearted talk, "and then we got in love."
He made laugh with the criticism he would get from the news media to give a comment that "not a president worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
said Trump in his parodie on a newsworm.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a more meeting, after Trump exclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear armoring of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "similar reaction" from the United States compared to the initial measures against disarmament.
He noted that, instead, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech at his electoral meeting.
"It's really good with North Korea," he said.
"There was a arrival for war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have an amazing relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve relationship with Kim had created positive results – end of missile tests, help with release of hostages and returning earthly residues from U.S. military men.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It is so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 100,000 people outside trying to get into this tight-packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," said Trump and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake ruin the island and kill hundreds
In the afterplay after the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations, for example, were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombox population were homeless, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"In many cases it has been clear that they do not request international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children compose a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe if foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the national disaster preparation, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency effort.
Because of the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly exposed, the country is very badly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami refuge sites have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastal lines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but there seems to be a lack of tsunamisirs, and this has probably influenced the death rate.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new place of accident.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s lack of infrastructure a central point in his electoral struggle, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Jokos administration has been plagued by lack of funding in the course of the next year's elections.
Mr Joko also experiences pressure from underlying sektarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes, when Christians and Muslim bands fought on the streets with makeets, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge compares in the last moment against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's target, while his team was back with 1-0.
He sticked to the ball with the left foot before he made a high shot to the remotest bar.
The ball flew high above the field to the top right corner of the network.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the network.
"It was just about getting in the position to get the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came and I made a single touch, and I didn't think so much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the half-game, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea angriber delivered with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he set the speed up on the middle track and sprinted into Liverpool's track half.
Kovacic made a fast one-two on the middle course.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defence and closed to the remotest bar with a shot with the left foot past Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights against Napoli in the team game in the Champions League at 15 Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 15 Thursday in London.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the latest memorandum of discussion on the re-write of history.
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "galship" and a "experience to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The picture storm during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his forefather Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a proof of attitudes in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still think it is worth giving.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is a precise mapping is subject to continuous historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognisable figure representing one side of the fight.
His performance as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Dræbergris attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in Southwest China according to local media reports.
The man, only identified under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an overwhelmed pulse year and swallowed in blood near a pig path on the market in Liupanshui, the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pig injections with vaccines at a pig use on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
He said he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig path next to was open.
He said there was a big orne in the swine path with blood in his mouth.
A medical investigation confirmed that the 250 kg pig had been biting the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed the man wasn't among Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collect evidence at the site of action.
It is reported that Yuans family and authorities from the market negotiate compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there are previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious damage.
Ten years earlier a pig of 295 kg had to have a Walisian farmer against his tractor, to his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News said that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a "triger".
"They're just physician.
The naps, they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just need to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of the orchestra Rosa is expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the Southwest United States
As predicted, the orchestra Rosa becomes weaker, as it moves over the cooler waters at the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will give strong rain to floods in northern Mexico and southwestern USA over the coming days.
Rosa had wins in 38 m/s, a category 1 orchestra, at 10 p.m. (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure runner across the Pacific, moving east to the United States' west coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it starts to push tropical moisture to the north into the southwest of the USA.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure runner that comes closer and create strong rain in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Locally 25 to 101 mm rain will create dangerous storm floods, liquid decay and possibly earthquake in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of the southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm rain is expected in parts of the southwest United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a great probability for storm floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move into the desert to the foot when there is a threat to tropical rain.
Heavily rain can transform clowns into bumpering rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dust blows.
The low pressure runner, approaching, will give strong rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which can give smaller amounts of liquid decay and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their raintime.
Spread tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of Four Corners Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
In October, there can be great temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic becomes cooler, but it remains fairly hot in the tropicals.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the Central USA Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast regions.</seg>
There can be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long climate prospect indicates that there is a great probability for temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million saw Thursday's gracious witness explanations from the nominated to the High Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was supposed to take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations that interrupted the general programs to tell about Friday's late development: an agreement composed by senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, which allowed the FBI to carry out a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Judgment Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was drunk in her condition and tried to take her clothes off to a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a emotional witness explanation that he's 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw that Friday.
The company listed average viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available viewers from other stations showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And the Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To set it in perspective, it is a viewer number that corresponds to a battle under NFL playoffs or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-born hosts have strongly backed up the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day consultation, said Nielsen.
ABC was in the second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interests remained high after the consultation.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republicans sent a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators cried to him when he tried to take an elevator for the hearing of the judgment committee.
He stood downwardly looking for several minutes while he was scared out, and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had sent a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing in the committee.
All television stations covered live a few hours later when the judge committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should go on to a vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote for under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated in the next week, which the Democrats, who are in submission to the Senate, had requested.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators thereafter, Flake took his decision.
Flake's choice was influenced because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU for "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests. This happened in an interview with Sunday Times.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview next to it with Theresa May on the front of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union should collect each other's tariffs was "whole through ridiculous".
Shot murder at Wayde Sims: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson who is suspected to stand behind the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect of the killing at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of dishonest killing, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Officers released video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the place of action and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the CBS daughter company WAFB.
After the hearing of Simpson, the police said he had admitted the shot murder on Wayde.
His security is set to $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The judicial doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish sent a preliminary report on Friday, where it said that the death cause was a wound from a gun shooting from the head to the neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, police from Southern University and citizens of the region have assisted in the investigation that led to arrest.
The Chairman of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "recognition and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per battle last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball trainer at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team is "crushed" and "in shock" over Waydes' death.
"That's the kind you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Vulcan spies ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Prevention of Disasters warned Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater, and 183 gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumble and shaking over several rounds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car routes in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital, since a earthquake measured 7.1 on the judge scale, shake central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police are in conjunction with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators who wished independence, confronted with urobites as many thousands participated in rivalising demonstrations that marked the first anniversary of the Catalonian Polaris vote on release.
A group of masked separatists kept unobetent, thrown with and powder painting and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There also occurred battle later on the day when the police used their spells to keep the fights down.
For several hours independence groups cried out "Not forgot, nothing forgiven" and were met with Unionist demonstrators who cried "Long life Spain".
14 people were treated for smaller damages that occurred during the protests reported the local press.
The vote remains high in the independent region one year after the vote of 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separateist catalans.
The electorates voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the electoral connection was low, and those who were against the release boykotted in great style the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were damaged last year after the police tried to stop the vote during violent collisions at voting places throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night to Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dare hope that Catalony can gain independence.
"The last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy of having the opportunity to vote, but now we sit firm," he said.
Although they had a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved in exile or sitting in detention and are waiting for their role in voting and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, took the protests on his phone to support the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There's getting bigger and bigger tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been waiting for his case since last year, reported that he would make up the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The position as a candidate for European elections is the best way to take away the relapse of the democratic values and the undersight we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car stabbed into a house in Londonderry several times.
The event occurred in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday about 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
It may also have been fired a brake against the car at a time.
Shots from Menga give Livingston victory on 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The tricks of Livingston overwhelmed Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard its only second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved side by side with Hibernian at the second place.
Gerrard's team has not won on the outground in the liga during this season and will meet the leading team of Hearts, which they are eight points after, next Sunday.
Before that, Ranger's visit is received by Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Livingston, in return, expands their unowned strip for six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has still not received a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances of cash outholding
Holt's team should have been before long before they scored, and their direct game style created great problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across front of the target, then Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target, after he glided in to hit Craig Halkett's transverse head in front of the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play before them because they knew they could give outstanding problems in death ball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers went free park, and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the post for Menga, which made a touch and scored from the center of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the property of balls, but struggled to come through the defense of the home team, and Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was rejected with the feet of the Rangers targeter Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame under another of Livingston's death ball situations.
Continuous surrenders arrived in Livingston's field, but were rejected, and two demands for a penal park – after Halkett's tackling the replacement Glenn Middleton and one for hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phänomenal efforts and strong results for Livingston.
All played amazing and exceeded the expectations of their upward trip.
Their style and troops are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he came to.
There were many heroes.
Commander Halkett was amazing and led a well-organized defence, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the teeth throughout the battle.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Sometimes they were really good under Gerrard, but they played under level.
Their conclusions lacked sharpness – only once they got the only home team – and it is a great awakening for Rangers, which is in the middle of the point table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Kühlen
There were smiles and blue heavens on Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There have been disagreements on areas such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's approach to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Køln to open a new big mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 from gathering before the mosque, but a lot of support appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noticed and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a whole of some German Turkish and insulted as an autocracy by others.
Accidents on the road in Deptford: Cyklist dies in collision with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the south-western part of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there were savers on the site, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a crash with a car whose driver escaped from the site, at Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said that police officers were working to identify the man and to inform his relatives.
There are set road blocks, bus routes have been changed, and motorists are invited to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured during disturbance
Six prisoner officers have been injured in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was disturbance in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 9.30 BST Sunday, and the disturbances are still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are picked up to deal with the noises that involve eight prisoners and take place in one fleet of prison.
The officers were treated for smaller facial damage on the site.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: "Especially trained prison workers are put in place to deal with the ongoing disturbances in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are declared that the responsible are notified to the police and can end up spending longer time behind the tremmers."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, unobetents were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances, where employees were attacked with billard balls.
The orchestra Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with a stormflood (dryer areas can benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure hits Arizona, but it is most likely to happen at the beginning of the next week when the rest of the orchestra Rosa moves over the desert landscape in the south-western USA and creates the risk of the storms.
National Weather Service has already sent warnings about the storm flood for Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a twin that only "three tropical cycles had maintained status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 64 km from the border to Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will probably receive 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For them outside the risk of the storms, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is a very serious case, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the Southwest United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the US Dry Surveillance, over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reports weather.com.
First, the orchestra Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still in force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north with 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit in Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become strong and give a great risk of flooding.
"The rainfall is expected to be 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to northwest Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the border to Arizona early in the morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very strong rain in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the southwest desert area of the United States," reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storms and liquid decay in deserts and soil decay in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for murder trials
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested under suspicion of murder attempts after a 16-year-old was found with stalk wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two-18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in Radstock area, the police in Avon and Somerset pronounced.
Officers have invited everyone who had to have mobile recordings of the events to come.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was subject to the "badness and anger" of the democratic party.
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the democratic party's unreasonable and monstrous tactics," said Trump at a election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been exposed to the "badness, anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave witness explanation before the Congress on Thursday and denied strong and emotional accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he was sexually committed to her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave witness explanation during the hearing of his accusations.
The President said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the most skillful legal brains of our time, a lawyer with an amazing past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of meeting the Republicans at the votes at mid-term elections.
"In five weeks there is one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote on me, but you actually vote on me," he said.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting for amazing candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "trust and block".
The first important procedure vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person placed high in the Republican Party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, the death rate grows
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a large earthquake and a great tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, pronounced authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a festival on the beach of Palu on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] high waves hit the coast at a cloudy time, sucked many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after a earthquake that measured 7.5 on the judge scale.
"When the tsunamitrus came up yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach. They didn't run immediately and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of Indonesia's disaster preparation GDP, under a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, the dragged cars, tree strains, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho and added that the tsunami had moved through the open sea by 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More managed to survive by climbing up into trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16.700 was evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The catastrophe preparation tool has published air photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afternoons continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be marked in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Board for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in an announcement that the energy triggered during Friday’s great earthquakes was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb that was thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bug, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "abstaining" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were crashed together.
The bodies of a number of victims were found attached to the walls of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been damaged, and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and damage could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was completely lammed without information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
"There are over 300 000 living here," said the Red Cross in an announcement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The board was criticized on Saturday from many fronts to notify that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time when the warning was sent.
Amateur recordings that are shared in social media can be heard by a man at the top floor of a building that desperately calls out warnings about the tsuamia that come closer to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and wears buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that dismantled the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send cargo aeroplanes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but there is still a hard need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for helping, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami smokes more than 800.
It's really bad.
World Visions employees from Donggla have safely arrived to Palu City, where employees are looking for ly under presensions set in the garden at their account. They came past areas with extensive destruction on the road, said Doseba.
"They told me that they were so many destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when helping organisations began the hard work to put the help work back, complaints were made that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, economic support, supply and employees from abroad must only enter if the area where the accident has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at province level," said Aulia Arriani, speaker of Indonesian red cross.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can open for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night of Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people kept firm in the hope that their closest would be the miracles that lighten the thrilling stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a cloak.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been caught under walls for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those caught at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mondayi, were among his students.
"As the veteran in paragliding I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how he had sent whatsApp messages to the participants of Palu, who were part of the festival on the beach, over the hours after the news about the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles.
However, his messages resulted only in one crying flue bone instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty takes $26,750 while filling the money machine in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole Friday morning 26.750 USD from a Brink's advertisement that was meeting a money machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The car's driver had cleared the money machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran back at the Brink's employee and stole a pocket that should have been delivered.
According to the press release, the Witnesses saw several suspects who fled from the site, but the police did not specify how many involved in the incident.
All with information about the identity of the thieves please contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Canye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote, "The creature previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the surname Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the songs of Ariana Grande on the show, which listened for "feelingal reasons," said the show's creator.
The name is a abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier in the year, where he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused pages, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who have changed the name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former collaborative partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between lower and upper case letters and changed whether the binding line is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military power against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military power against civilians, as the country approaches the 50s for a bloody reward action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he would never ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
The troops shot against a peaceful demonstration on the place on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-oriented student movements hit root many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly State grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal bonds.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount they use on research within the field, says investor and AI users Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, after various parts of the U.S. government have made statements of artificial intelligence, but the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aimed at taking the first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind compared to the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
Doubleing the budget could double the chances that the next major performance in artificial intelligence will be achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Executive Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest rated American Othello player, and later he became director of Microsoft Research and director of the Google department in China.
Lee recognised previous technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge, which was held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition will come so that the next visionaries can be identified.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to obtain legs from the government, says Lee.
"It isn't China that snatches the academic leaders, it's the big businesses," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think PhDs in the field of artificial intelligence should have offered professional permissions automatically.
China's State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and the distribution of money by other government organisations to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defence Ministry established a common centre for artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests over 100 million USD a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, American legislation, which seeks to establish a national Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has been still for several months.
Macedonians shall vote on the amendment of the country's name
The Macedonian people voted Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "The Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a decade of old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to achieve membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbouring country to the north constitutes a requirement in the Greek territory, and has therefore used their vetore when Macedonia has sought access to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primary slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote, and a boycot campaign has raised doubts about whether the electoral amount will be the 50 % required to make the vote valid.
The question on the voting note was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Adherents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is worth paying for the creation of access to associations such as the EU and the NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's paraply, because it means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the vote result and make it applicable.
The change of name would require a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The State's election Commission said that at 13 o'clock there were no irregularities reported.
However, the election participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent at the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered electors voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a chooser in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko attended the vote in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country which would open up for membership of the NATO and the EU, in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents, which were set up by those who want to go to the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we will get membership with a travel pane, not at the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asiatic integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would give a strongly demanded investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote for because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and the NATO," said Zaev after giving up their vote.
He said a "yes" result would be a "safe of our future."
A statement of opinion published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43% of the voters would participate in the vote – less than the electoral participation required.
Another observation made by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of these 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the prosperous government since it entered in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero fights throughout the Brighton Defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score that came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a delivery on the middle course at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran quickly by three Brighton defences before he swallowed out on the open path.
Aguero was surrounded by four green trees.
He fought by one defender, and then he ran from several at the edge of the Brighton field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, which used its right boot to list the Brighton painter Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero struggles with some problems with the feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
"We talked about him to play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate advance in the Premier League battle.
That target came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in that sequence the ball deep in the area of Brighton.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he led Sterling to the remotest bar.
The Sky Blues-forward stitched the ball in the network just before it glitched by the target.
City fights against Hoffenheim in the team game in the Champions League at 12.55 Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to drille Rockies.
Nationals have been eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the castuen Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still an opportunity to participate in playoffs for Rockies, who have played a battle more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies at least held fast in a wild card space with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Friday evening, but still have their first division title for good.
"Even if we don't have anything to play for, we can go to the fight well knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet registered the starting position for Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the plate for 34th time, trained his castings on Tuesday and would pitche on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The right hand player from Washington is located on 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inches in this season.
Trump holds electoral meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around his elections to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of meeting the Republicans at the places of vote at mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It is one of the big, great – you can't vote on me, but you actually vote on me. That's why I'm going around and fighting for amazing candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you can see that it happens right now.
And they are determined to get the power back with all the resources available. You can see how evilly, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt who they're going over to get power and control.
The Democrats, he said, have, as a mission, "trust against and block."
"And you have seen it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "peaceful and evil and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned the supreme democratic senator of the Senate's District Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which triggered the audience's audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you like the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, oh no, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those who express their attitudes
When momentum's activists in my local party voted to censure me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the last one in a wide range of Members from Labour who have been told that we are not welcome – only because we have made our opinion known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she strongly dismissed antisemitism.
In my case, the censur plan was to criticize me because I was disagreeable with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically enough similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
The call for the meeting at Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For the majority of my eight years as a local parliamentary member, the meetings have just been such on Friday evening.
Unfortunately today, the tone in many meetings is not that way, and the promise of "friendlyer, milder" policy is far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become more and more evident that different views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed according to whether the leadership of the party can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues, as I previously thought I shared the political position, began to expect that I would make an U-inversion and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed – whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and that is really no matter what I say – I follow a long series of rough messages on the social media that call for the elimination and opposition of the mid-term policy and tell me that I should not be a member of the Labour.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the fighting will of the colleagues who are every day exaggerated with sexism or racism, but still continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is where abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour was supposed to create a tolerant culture.
However, in reality, it is no longer a spatial organization and with each abuse voting or changing selection rules the party becomes smaller.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years, that if I lay low on myself and I'm not so loud, I'm going to be able to do it anyway.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left our classroom in a fall-by state, and I sat myself to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it has been as a city council member or minister of the government.
I've never hide my policy, nor during the last choice.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current management.
To those who submitted the resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country strikes against Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local electorates, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no form of threats to abuse or political suitability will prevent me from acting out of what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Uncovered Ayr becomes top team
Two later scores may have made the final result to draw a not completely true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazing entertaining match of the day in Tentent's Premiership.
They are now on the top of the scoreboard and are the only unowned team of ten.
Finally, it was as much as their superior defence as their better utilization of chances that had the homehold, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our struggles have been demanding so far, and we are still unsuccessful, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish country team player Rory Hughes, who was distributed to fight by Warriors, gave Melrose a advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penalty park just before the half-game. He scored and then got a soloscoring, so there was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed up by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had received a serious injury. He was carried out of the track on the bear. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Working Ayr manager Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose used their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a successive kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the prominent Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the bars and followed up with a more nearly immediately after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe snapped David Armstrong's box kick and sent pilot Gregor Henry off to the fifth score of home track.
Still Game stars looking for new career in the restoration industry
Still the game star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry after it appeared that he has entered the director's position for an authorized restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series that he writes and is the main person with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment on history, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that the Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The Sea is ours": the country of India Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol around the headquarters of the fleet, sheltered in rigs, in La Paz.
In public buildings, there is a sea-blue flag.
Flot bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overmalted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout the country of Bolivia, a coastal distance lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same is the longing to sail again in the Pacific.
The hopes may be at their highest for several decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of vote.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and, of course, is waiting with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court on large-screen screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will provide Bolivia with the obligation to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereignty over a area of access to the sea after decades of discussion.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's carismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial election fight next year, also has a lot to play in the judgment on Monday.
"We're close to return to the Pacific," he promised late August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take the party of Bolivia – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which has seats in the Netherlands, has no power to overcome Chilen territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the International Court of Justice rejects judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have been reversed.
"The case of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
Morales' warrior rhetorics have disappeared the remaining chilen welwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the Court was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given "a extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance of "finishing an era of 139 years of disagreements and gaining advantages for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political cricket.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there is no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never defeat their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to observe promises given at a summit in Singapore between the rivalising leaders.
His comments were given in the extension that the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to face a restart of the fixed nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with the Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is a "woman dream" to continue penalties and the US' opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean war will ever bring North Korea in the knee.
Washington is insufficient to declare so long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump will have a summit more.
But there is widespread scepticity in relation to whether Pyongyang is serious in relation to the removal of an arsenal, which the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Mode shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large main clothing that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk for a collection of strange head clothing in extra big size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hat has dominated on Instagram in summer, and the two designers have sent their incredible creations down the catwalk.
The most impressed work from Valentino was an overwhelmed with a feather-like wide shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including water melons with jewels and even ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had combined lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving stuff with snorkel and mask, and others looked like a melted vaffel ice.
And if you continue the great fashion statements, you're lucky.
Style scouters predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The battle hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the strap hat with a 60 cm wide shadow that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark, which is behind the highest unpractical hatred that was spread over social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw, which is almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange bastard with bastfruits and a white leather handle was the most visible in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in general shops next summer. The designer has had so great influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in giant size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Schotland's independent schools have many great academic results behind themselves, and it is still in 2018 with a number of other unique exam results that are also strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other efforts in the local community.
With up to 30 000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as global citizens.
As a educational sector that can compose and implement a curriculum, we see that modern language remains a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that hits your head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits the heart."
It is an important reminder that we can not just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest test results this year that languages are the highest in the statistics with most exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the high character A.
The data collected by SCIS’ 74 member schools showed that 72% of the students received the grade A in mandarin, while 72% of those studying German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as subject choices at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers were unable to occupy vacancies, 17 % had to do with lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly important in preparing young people for their future career.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career youths choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a precedent to the competitors.
According to a YouGov measurement with over 4,000 respondents in Britain in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
It is therefore important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When speaking more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children give a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ between the languages in which they are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important for Britain when looking forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to achieve success, regardless of what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be truly important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and that must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to the youth of Scotland.
Il faut bee le faire.
John Edward is leader of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Laker's Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James play its first battle for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James plays in the Sunday opening game before seasonal start against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet determined how many minutes he's playing.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reports Mike Trudell twisted that James is most likely not going to play the whole battle.
After the training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six matches before the season start.
"Where I'm in my career, I don't have to fight before seasonal start to get ready," he said.
Trumps election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a strike electoral meeting tonight in Wheeling in West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of the Judge appointed by Trump at the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump is trying to provide support for the next mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control over the Congress when the votes are delivered in November.
When is Trump's pick-up meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is held at midnight (Danish time) night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's chooser meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were excited because of accusations of sexually violating behaviour, and the expected vote in the Senate for confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI examines the charges.
But the primary objective of this series of electoral meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans who face a difficult choice in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that the five election meetings next week aim to "create energy among volunteers and support when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Reuters," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is as important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, now that we enter the busy campaign time," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, which would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
The evening election meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump followers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, which is behind the opinion measurements.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has to troop up to give him a boost in the measurements," said Simon Haeder, who is dealing with state science at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Clearer Cup 2018: Team USA has shown battle spirits and is trying to keep the hope alive before Sunday single dolls
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday's four-man duel might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The turning momentum pendul is a fully invented sport concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we probably see that a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth, before he held the fourth.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: they are 4 points in front and 12 points are more to play about.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have some wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can praise with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and set a good example for his teammates.
The high shouts of joy became higher, as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put that secured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duals.
His put, which guaranteed them the battle on hole 15 was met with a similar shout – the kind of shout that shows that he does not think the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just need to find the inner strength and focus on your own fight," said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the largest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but sympathetic couples have received four points in four matches, and they appear unfailingly.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not get a bookey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Buchey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience, shows that it is the ones that it will be the hardest to hit Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory was fastened by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
All of them synchronously on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning completely in the four-man dolls, when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes digged the Spanish and the Swedish down into a hole they were never near to getting out.
Sunday no one can help you out of your hole.
The fights with four balls and two teams of a two players are so fascinating to look closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can quickly change.
Europe has played better as a team until now and has created a significant leadership before the last day, but the four-man Jews have also shown that the team of the United States has the battle spirit, which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates leadership at 10-6 prior to the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a leadership over the United States at 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the road with two victories over a difficult Tiger Woods and has hit four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the pocal they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a unprecise American team in the morning's four balls and won the series 3-1.
The United States made more opposition in foursomes, they won four matches, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the pokal.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together got the nickname "Molliwood" is after a sensational weekend the only second couple in Ryder Cup's history that has won four points in their first four matches.
They broke Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then defeated elegantly a discouraged Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through the first two battles on Saturday, had small genius glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning's four-balls and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and received a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it, as they want, in a lightly blowing day southwest of Paris.
Three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way to the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They received a hard fighting 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup history that a team has struggled back after being back with four points before the single matches. However, since Furyks currently has the pokal, they need only to get unequivocal to keep it.
However, after having been the second best for two days, it seems that they cannot master an attack on Sunday.
Northern Korea says that they will not disrupt unilaterally if there is no confidence
The Northern Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthen their mistrust to the United States and that the country will not give up their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the global organization's general meeting that North Korea had shown "beacious willingness" in the last year, e.g. by stopping nuclear and missile tests, developing an area for nuclear tests and not promised to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We haven't seen a similar response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will take the first step and disarmament unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-shaped" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important, as it did not clearly reject unilateral disarmament, as otherwise the case was of Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a common pronouncement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting American President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "atom disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has asked for a formal end of the Korean war, which occurred in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to soften up the scratching of international sanctions against North Korea.
"USA insists on 'atomic disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even contradicts the 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
"The perception that the sanctions can bring us in the knee is a dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that they continued sanctions strengthen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader highlighted at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the nuclear disarmament was to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the fire of North Korea's rockets against the US continent was inevitable, after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocked man" on suicide mission.
Last year, Trump in the United Nations threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim to show courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still a lot to be done and that the sanctions must remain until North Korea disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for these actions, but said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without mistake until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met with Ri on the side line during the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that there had been progress, while North Korea just a few hours after accused him of setting "passionary requirements."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile and an atomic complex if the United States took "like steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "similar steps", he demanded, were the security lifts that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements against normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture where you study the whole night with large amounts of caffeine.
A scientist has shown that students at the best university in the world often don't know the first to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleeping medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he thinks, is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea to the course after keeping a statement of the effects of sleep lack on learning.
"When the edition was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get this first to know now when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains the students how good sleep habits can improve your academic and sports performance and your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University’s Health Area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleep shortages during the week.
The hourly course consists of different interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a collegie room where students need to click on coffee cups, gardins, runshoes and books to get knowledge of the effects of caffeine and light, and how your sports performance is affected by a lack of sleep and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear how sleep shortages over a long time increase the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
The participants are invited to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking a "allnighter" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and enough sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain, because sleep shortage causes the brain to believe that you are hungry, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course last year when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course at the entire university.
He hopes that the next will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before they continue their training.
Professor Czeisler recommends the students to put an alarm, so they know when to sleep and when to get up. This can create consciousness about the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens that can move at the day rhythm and make it more difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Measures from Menga lower Gerrard and co.
Rangers had another defeat on the outside, when Dolly Mengas' goal meant that Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team had to take thanks with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was out for their first victory on the outground since 4-1-triumphen on St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only another defeat in 18 struggles as trainers. Thus there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of Ladbroke's Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not reply to.
Rangers now smokes down to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up at a third place after Hibernian with only the target score to difference.
And there could be several bad news on the way to Rangers, as the rulers of Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit by a thrown object that seemed to come from the outdoor section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the setup that reached Betfed Cups semifinale by tons past Ayr.
On the other hand, Holt stood with the same 11, which barbed a point of Hearts' leadership last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhaust the opponents all over the path.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the battle, when Mengas first delivery sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle-way player's attempt passed.
A frising park in the depth of Keaghan Jacobs found a way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow kicked by the rear pile.
Yet, Rangers took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
At least, Alfredo Morales was not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson admitted the columbian's appeals to punishment park, when he and Steven Lawless brought together after a quarter's game.
Rangers could only have two shots on targets in the first half of the egg, but the former Rangers targeter Liam Kelly did not have any problems with Lassana Coulibalys headshots and Ovie Ejaria's tame shots.
Although Livis opened in the 34th minute was something random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a dead ball situation in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga who could easily kick it in target.
At the break Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave pots when the pilot sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the team to play on their premises with many long balls up on the path from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the last part of the battle, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the target.
Rangers' exchanger Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late punishment park after being dried with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": on 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we TALLER... – was the day when the future physician Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Gegers invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that would lead to the apparatus known as the giant counter.
The Geiger Counter has become a solid component of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main roles as bondage scientists:
Man, "What the hell is it?"
Rogers: "It's a giant counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that radioactivity in minerals makes."
Evans, "Keep up, now it's going on!"
"He's" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would've filled 63.
But the invention wearing his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune defense to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and change them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common for many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine works in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, learning the immune defense to recognise cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from patients and change them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein named HER2, as many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "is allowed to develop several forms of cancer", including breast-, ovarian, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Canye West held Trump-friendly speech on a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't work well.
After an inconsistent appearance in the Saturday Night Live Study, Kanye West was defeated when he celebrated the U.S. President, Donald Trump, and said that he would set up himself as a president candidate in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening, Ghost Town had a Make America Great Again cassette, he began to speak against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I'm so often talking to white people who say, "Why do you like Trump, he's racist?"
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have been moved from the United States for the longest time," he said.
SNL started the evening show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star was laughing with Brett Kavanaugh's witness explanation in the Senate's Jurisdiction Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault complaint.
Although the recordings weren't shown, the comic was uploading Chris Rock Wests to the social media.
It's uncertain if Rock tried to show West by putting up the recordings.
West also complained to the audience of poor treatment backstage because of his head clothing.
"They knocked me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hate."
They fucked me!
And they said I was deeply sinked," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Will you see how deep I am sinked?" and said that he would take his Superman cap on, because it means "you can't decide what to do. Would you like to make progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience blowings at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassed, Variety explains with a comment from a person present: "There was a bombing in the study."
West had been booked as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose then boyfriend, the raper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many by acting with the song I Love It, while he was dressed out like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative Group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who twisted: "To one of the most courageous people: DO NOT DO NOT LOOK YOU THE POBLE."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter twisted that West is just "as he is, and it's quite fine."
"But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art") that embraces and eliminates an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And we also have," she added.
Before the show, the rapist had announced that he had taken a name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who has changed the name, and thus follows Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rap colleague Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and the recently dead musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Prosecution of murder attempts for knife knitting at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of murder attempts after a man was buried on Friday with a knife at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, says the police.
Applicants are expected to be brought to the Court of First Instance in Belfast on Monday.
The claims are reviewed by the public accusation authority.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington longs out after toxic maskulinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress longs out after the stereotypical macho whole and says that such TV characters mean that young men often feel that they must be hard to be respected.
Kit declared to Sunday Times Culture that he believes that there's been something wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic maskulinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who was recently married to his Game of Thrones-master Rose Leslie on 31, admitted that the problem is "very in mind".
"At the moment, it's a lot on my mind – where have we gone wrong in the city with maskulinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what have we learned young men in their growth?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic maskulinity due to the very maskulin characteristics.
He said, "What is inborn, and what is allowed?
What are the young men learning from the television and on the streets that make them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think that is one of our time's big questions – how do we change that?
'Cause it's obvious that something's gone wrong for the young men.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he wouldn't make followers to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said he's "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit contributes from November to a replay of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film instructor and his brother who is thieve.
The actress recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best at the whole Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my coming family and formed my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kits character, Jon Snow, gets in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
Over 8200,000 people in the country have been affected, according to the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to something nearly zero, Chinese health authorities report at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100.000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is, accordingly, a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry before or since with women because of the country's conservative values.
Many infections are due to the lack of prevention in these situations.
Since 2003, China's government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denyes to employees leaking data on Republican senators and torture against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied the Saturday accusations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the claims came from websites and support from "the extreme right-wing".
"Laughs, lies and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter lookup.
The published information contained reported home addresses and telephone numbers of the American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was released on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill. This happened during a hearing in the Senate for sexual assault against the High Courtnominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The delicious thing happened after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by Waters' people, then they published information about a member of the Waters staff, writes The Hill.
"This unjustified accusation is completely false and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unjustified accusation is completely false and a direct lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticised online, including from former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's a angry denial," said Fleischer.
"It indicates that she does not have the right temperament to be a congress member.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, don't get angry.
You shouldn't be proud.
Do not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You need to keep your mind alone."
Fleder seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats of Kavanaugh, who was criticized to be too angry during the Thursday consultation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aimed to take Waters' place in the mid-term election, also announced his opinion on Twitter.
"Great, if it's true," he twisted.
In the official statement of Waters, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the rule of law concerning these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the actors are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and anyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again – devastating spy comedie with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British ice leather, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedie in the Johnny English series that started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the country's new export option be dry, sarcastic self-satiers, about how hard it is to do with us?
At least the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the great eyes have received his permission to make bruilers renewed again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic inventory focused on places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife peak Mr. Bean and really climbing by him who performed a single tone for the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international lush bucks that left chaos in his refrigerator water after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television advertisements.
There are some good moments in this last shot on the JE tribe.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a middle-age armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels quite underwhelming and strangely overwhelming, especially now where more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed to children rather than to adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as atkinson's stupid film fools in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point of the film is that the United Kingdom is in serious crises.
A Internet hacker has infiltrated England's homely spy network and revealed the identity of all the English agents in the field for a terrifying the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a pompous and battle-clean Prime Minister, who already suffers a complete melting in political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
Since her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been revealed, she is required to cancel someone's pension.
And of course, it is the stupid Johnny English, who is now a school supervisor at a superclass school, but who in hide teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for a kind of School of Rock education in spionage.
English rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with his hardly tested previous right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an enthusiastic but well-mentioned U-boat captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine was wasted on.
Thus, the Royal Intelligence Service's entirely embarrassed Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful five fatal, Ophilia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is snubbling close to letting himself emigrate by the carismatic and horrible technician Jason Volta, the game of Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their angry risky eskapads: Decorated as servants they put fire to an ancient French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxuryacht; and English creates pure ragnarok, as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to make himself known with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired off in the final sequence of the film, but no matter how well meant and powerful it is, there is a sense of child television over it.
Very moderate.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking with the other Johnny English films: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to fight with plans for four-day working week with unchanged wages to the British
Jeremy Corbyns Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can be kept with a four-day week of work, but few pay for five.
The party claims to have business managers to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give the employees an extra Friday.
This would mean that the employees would have three days' weekends without falling in wages.
Sources say that the idea would conform to the party's economic objective to draw the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day week of work as a way for workers to benefit from a change in economy.
A experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that suits the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the overall strategy of the party for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the elections to the elections in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported by unanimously in the Labour Party.
A speaker of the Labour Party said, "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell declares that he is determined to return power from "anonymous directors" and "using" in supply companies.
The plans of the Shadow Finance Minister also sore doubts whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour at the end could "compense" them on the basis of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to have employees in business boards and to set up, including owner funds, to distribute 10% of the share value of private enterprises to employees who receive up to 500 pounds per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's finding could cause the Republican senators to draw their support.
In a Sunday interview, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something that could make them change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I entered the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, "Do you do that?"
He was steel set, definitely and unique."
On the other hand, Graham's voice seems to be in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and otherwise would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it most powerfully," added Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see that it had to change anything."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York is a host town for the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an even as impressive goal; to end the world's poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will receive for the seventh time tens of thousands of people on Central Park's large plenary, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal of making an end to extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international stakeholder organisation that struggles to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert gangers must carry out a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or another meaningful action that can create attention about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years left to reach the target?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" – i.e. people feel that they do a difference by signing a signature collection on the web or making a Twitter lookup?
Global Citizen notes that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different objectives.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding goals and political measures equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 targets and actions that had become due to their actions, which amounted to over $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have hitherto had a direct impact of almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has been started in England and is a cooperation between investors and traders. They strive to "help children with their full potential" and promise 35 million dollars to remedy nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 twots from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, the social injustice with undernutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the England government has now promised resources to improve the nutrition of mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In answer to one of the website's often asked questions, saying, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: "It's going to be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we're going to snub and make mistakes.
But as with the movement of citizens' rights and the movements against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the acting at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" for Russian energy sports, says the US Ministry of Industry
"When necessary" Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from coming on the market, also in the Middle East, reveals the US Minister for Industry, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examines.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s interference with Syria – especially where they operate on the invitation of the legal government – is a deficit to expand their energy sales.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he must have said.
And he says there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The US has the opportunity with our fleet to ensure that there is free passage on the seaways, and if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organisation that regards itself as the "vote of the American energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that they are in the same way.
"The economic possibilities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These opinions come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing the European export of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, speakers of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump itself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the "catch of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 line, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively an economic project.
Kreml believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of different conditions of competition and simply due to economic considerations.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose supplier," said the Russian Energy Minister, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to interfere outside the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third party is involved in our energy supplies," said the leader of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to set up the presidential election in 2020, says the senator from Massachusetts
Senator in Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to make up the presidential elections after mid-term elections, she said Saturday.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering to set up.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and this requires a woman in front," she said in the Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider strongly to set up the presidential elections."
Warren announced his opinion about President Donald Trump under the City Council and said that he "does the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does about our democracy," she said.
Warren has been expressed in his criticism of Trump and his High Courtnominated Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI has to examine the matter before the vote."
However, a Thursday opinion measurement shows that the majority of Warren's own backland does not believe that she should set up in 2020.
According to a measurement from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" choosers in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32% supported the possible candidate hour.
The measurement showed greater support to former governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% against a possible position.
Other highly profiled democratic candidates discussed in the election of Presidents in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The Bid declares that he announces his final decision in January, writes Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a pick-up meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of violence at home.
"What my own son goes through after he has come home, makes me able to relate to other families that notice the consequences of PTSD and other damages that our soldiers return home," she told the audience to a Trump-chooser meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elefant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and have become harder, they are going to think if there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of violence at home against a woman, to prevent the notification of violence in the home and to be in possession of a weapon in drunk state, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman of the police in Wasillas.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new American law rejecting asylum to victims who flee from punishment or violence at home.
Representatives from the 18 States and D.C. delivered on Friday in Washington a party-dependent declaration in support of a asylum applicant who opposes the law, says the NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union entered in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are bandage members" had abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was held in Texas.
The State Prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum applicants originate, as countries with widespread problems with bands and violence at home.
The new US asylum legislation rejected a decision taken by the American foreign event in 2014 which allowed undocumented immigrants who fled from violence at home to seek asylum.
The district of Columbia's State Advocate, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new law "shes away from the government, federal and international law of decades."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle," states the party independent declaration.
The lawyers also argued that the law on rejecting immigrants damages the American economy, as there is more likely that they become independent and "lever the necessary labour."
In June, justice minister Jeff Sessions deprived immigration judges of the right to give asylum to victims who flee from violence at home and volunteer.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political position," said Sessions in its notice of the Law on 11 June.
It has never been the intent that asylum should address all the problems – or only all serious problems – that people throughout the world face every day.
While the death rate is doubled, the attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For survivors the situation only became worse.
"It's very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her little fever-ramed boy at a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their destroyed homes to sort in bloody possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, also affected by the 7.5 - earthquake, could not follow.
Some of the injured ones, including Dwi Haris, who broke the back and shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outside due to strong afterlife.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shake the hotel room in the fifth floor, he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was mast up against a destroyed wall, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and added that his family was going to wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was still.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper that struck throms for the benefits of an American-Chinese collaboration, accused the U.S. Ambassador in China Beijing to use the American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, the U.S. President, Donald Trump, referred to China Daily’s immigration in Des Moines Register – Iowas’s best selling newspaper – after accusing China to intervene in the Congress elections of 6 November. China rejects the accusation.
American officials declare to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the US election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Peking and Washington are now locked up in an escalating trade war, where they have in several ways imposed customs duties on each other's import products.
China's reimbursement duty in the trade war was to hit exporters in States such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, believes Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador in China, former governor for a number of years in Iowa, which is a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
Branstad wrote in a leader in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China "tracks up the use of the unfine methods of driving propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by driving a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing you will find only a few disagreements. And you will not get a fair picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people to China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under tight control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he didn't say which.
Republicans foreign women before the mid-term election with the Kavanaugh case, warns analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend the High Court'snominated Brett Kavanaugh against complaints about sexual violations, analytics warn that they will experience a reaction in the coming mid-term election, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in the cook, and most Republicans have already published that they would like to see the vote process continue.
"This can't be done again," said Grant Reher, professor of State Knowledge at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said that he doubts that the Republican senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona) request for an FBI study in 11 hours will milden anger choosers.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they don't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, the demonstrators cried out: "November comes!" when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, chose to go on with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness statement by Professor Christine Blasey Ford, Mic says that.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach a new height," said the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"The people say that it has already reached a high level; that's right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among women's swing choosers in the forests and younger electors – 18-29-year-olds – as rarely votes, despite not enjoying the President."
Even before Ford's public accusations on the sexual violation of the Supreme Court nominated, analysts had pointed out that if the Republicans continued to nominate, it could result in a relapse.
"It has become a worse root for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote or the final result of the committee, or whether Kavanaugh is responsible; it is also about how the Republicans have handled this, and how they have treated it," pointes Guy Cecil, President of the United States Priorities – a group supporting Democrats to be elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared attitudes to whom they should believe after the witness explanations from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new statement from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford's witness explanation, while 35% said that they were certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought that Kavanaugh was either likely or definitely lying under his witness explanation, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After request from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the accusations submitted by Ford and at least another, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's court committee last week that Kavanaugh was fully confronted with her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the High Court nominator showed her his sex parts to a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend is Inruption and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inruption is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can create their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is, as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique to the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to John Bruce, the company’s Executive Director, the idea of Inruption is to collect resources, processes and ability to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralized apps by using the available tools on Inrubr's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely, so all of their business models suddenly become overflowing."
"We don't ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in a survey on Medium on Saturday that Inruption's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem, which can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important vote in the so-called network neutrality debate.
While Inruption is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: The clergy receiver of the Victoria Cross from World War I is celebrated
The only priest of the English Church, who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I, is celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Colonel Lieutenant and priest Bernard Wann won the order on 29 September, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a snatch shooter and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vand, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "unbelievable symbolic", that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-winning business.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Lieutenant Watn d. 29 September 1918 led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under severe shooting from machine guns and artillery."
Later he ran to the front line and led his people out with the "greatest man's courage" before he alone attacked an artillery and uninjured three guns.
Colonel Lieutenant Watn was killed by a German snake shooter on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vand at 72 said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Watn also put a crane after the parade, which was mentioned by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Watn said that he “feel very honored to participate in the parade” and added that“the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroic.”
MMA fans got up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the bellator 206 stars and then it's refused to see the main event.
There were 13 struggles on the San Jose program, including six struggles on the main program, and they were shown the night through in England at Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald made themselves ready to meet each other, the viewers in England became somewhat surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimposed after keeping awake until early morning for just this battle.
A fan on Twitter described the change to a child-owned movie as "a kind of sick joke."
"In law, this content was not appropriate at 6 p.m., why they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's seniorvice president, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Gurli', yes."
Bellator's Executive Director, Scott Coker, said that they will work to include English viewers in the future planning.
"When thinking of the re-send, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But it's six Sunday morning there, and we can't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the matter.
Trust me, when the change was changed, I got a lot of messengers, and they weren't all kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We're just having five matches instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minority" over sexuality
The Olympic diving Tom Daley says that he felt less worthy than all others in his grown up because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to get success.
The 24-year-old said that it didn't happen to him until he came into the bigger classes that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hop".
He also said that he went less into winning OL after being a parent.
The usual host on the radio program that has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken free a few months because of disease.
Daley was a guest in Lavers' first program and said that he felt "minder worth" than everyone else in his grown up because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, "From now on, the emotions of feeling worthy of memory and feel different were the things that have given me strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winds have become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and used its participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky in living open without negative consequences, and he would give others hope.
The three-double world champion said that he had become " surprised" when he was in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said that it is difficult to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar up- and downturns when you go through so much in such a young age – he went to his first OL as 14-year-old, and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed."
"If you had asked me last year, it would be all if I had to win a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as 40 years after having been diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley told me his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had received tickets to London 2012 – when he would sit in front.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there at that time.
I kept his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first came to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year Daley participated in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life – to dive in front of a home public at OL. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first song choice – Proud of Heather Small – that had meant much during the uptake to the OL and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is running on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unsharp Mickelson on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson records on Sunday when he plays his 47th battle in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something with the shape if it shouldn't be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who records by joining for 12 times in the competition, which is settled every 2 years, was placed on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the events of the United States as usual, the five - double big winner had to age hops and practice his game in the hope of fixing the faces.
Even at the peak of the career he had the most straight drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the Le Golf National track, where the long rough often punishes wild shots.
And if the path wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will meet the exact winner of British Open Francesco Molinari at the ninth battle on Sunday, who has joined the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four fights this week.
If the Americans start the 12 single matches start strongly, Mickelson's battle may be crucial.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a knock on my back, put his arm about me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He's in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and this week too.
I probably didn't think he was going to play two matches.
I imagined he was going to play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everybody else."
On Sunday Mickelson Nick Faldos record for most played matches in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Cleaner Cup career that has never been able to measure completely with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven undefined ones, even though Furyk said that his presence contributes with something undefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, weird, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes with much more than only the game."
Captain Thomas Bjørn of Europe knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
The European captain Thomas Bjørn knows of experience that a solid leadership before the last day of Ryder Cups single-ups can quickly become nervous.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advance over the Americans, but was just getting retrieved before the target line with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice leadership in Valderrama, we had a nice leadership in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just just watered," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's gonna have to be full of waste tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it is to try to win the trofee, and that's where our focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what is on the other side – the best golf players in the world."
Enjoyed with the performance of his players on a difficult path, Bjørn added: "I don't take any of this as of course.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performance that counts, and that's something completely different.
It's amazing to be out there with a partner when it's okay, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all parameters as golf player.
That's what the players have to understand – get the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he also needs to get the best in himself."
Otherwise it looks like the opponent Jim Furyk who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced cokings on the last day. First at the winner team in Brookline before he lost when Europe made "Miraklet on Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want a good start that you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts a great pressure on the intermediate fights.
We compose our team in relation to it and put the players on the path in the order we feel for. We're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task to try to guide the relapse and face Rory McIlroy in the top battle, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it guarantees us all the way through," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warship is postponed again
The newest fregat of the German fleet should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the cold war. However, the Germans must wait at least one year again due to technical problems and an escalating price, writes local media.
The establishment of the largest ship in the entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of fregates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been launched for the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military speaker.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but surviving problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered back in 2007 shall replace the ageing fregates from the Bremen class.
They know that they want a powerful canon, a large range of anti-air shooting and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature for the latest fregates is a smaller need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the fregates away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships, which, as it is said, will make Germany appear as an overseas power factor, will already be obsolete when they are inserted, writes Die Zeit.
The failure of the F125 fregat created headings last year, when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
It was not known much about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of decisive "software and hardware errors", which made the warship unusable in battle situations.
Software errors were of particular importance when the ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – it is only half of that crew from the older Bremen fregates.
It also appeared that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the possibility of future updates.
The 7000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, which includes training of the crew, is also by being a problem.
It is said to have reached swinging €3.1 billion (3.6 billion dollars), with an original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates become even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet force is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Government, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "launches clear ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He complained that none of the fregates from Baden-Wuerttemberg class was ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Snails to the Secret Life of the flager museums
New research from an area in the Scottish highland is trying to reveal how flagermus uses the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will throw light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help in the work of future preservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland National Trust and follows common flagermus, dwergflagermus, long-earning flager mice and waterflag mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in thoroughly selected places in the area to include the activities of the flager museums through the season.
Data are also collected by NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the flager mice calls and show the type of action.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat is made.
Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal the most important areas of the habitat and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of angels and how to best preserve forest areas for flager mice and similar species.
The number of flager mice in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased dramatically over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban enlargement projects that affect the farmers and restrict their habitats.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flufellers, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pet animals.
Flag mice isn't really blind.
But because they are mainly hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced ecolocation technique to find insects and fly outside obstacles.
NTS, responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flager mice very seriously.
They have ten trained experts, which often collect data, inspect reds and sometimes make rescue actions.
The organization has even made Scotland the first and only dedicated flager mice reserve at the area around Threave in Dumfreees and Galloway, which is home for eight out of ten of Scotland flager mice species.
The operator of the area, David Thompson, says that it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for flager mice," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is a lot that you don't know about flager mice, so the work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to flourish."
He emphasizes the importance of looking for flager mice before making maintenance tasks on property, since the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and kids, thereby risks to eradicate a whole local population.
Flag mice is peaceful, and it is illegal to kill, generate or disturb them or their rescues.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project leader of Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to give a hand with.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our flager mice, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects assault chargers, while lawyers appeal for German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charger against him for "fair news" and says that people will "promove themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to prosecute the German news media Der Spiegel that brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the claims had been published, the 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers at Instagram Live and criticized the information to be "fair news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-double winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to appeal to Der Spiegel because of the accusations they have called "a unforgivable publication of suspicions of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral destruction in a class corresponding to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event took place in June 2009 at a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other on a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he should have raped her anally according to the submitted report in the City Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was "a good guy 99% of time" grabbed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got photographed her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court, because she felt "banged for remuneration" and worried about being "officially embarrassed".
The 34-year-old now says that she will break the agreement, since she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was faced with a change from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the event should have taken place, and switched in summer to the Italian big club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will undo forever" to lose car manufacturers
United Kingdom "will regret it forever", if it lost its status as leading car manufacturer in the world after Brexit," Minister for Business, Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "angry" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting at the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, where 90 % of these were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop our factory if Britain smokes out of the EU at the end of March," said the Executive Director at Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers are related to the risks with the supply chain in the event of an outcome without agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from both the United Kingdom and the EU suppliers.
If Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of production at Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that the Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the European Union is "composed to avoid precisely these inspections at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that does not just allow us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success but to take this option," he said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we have to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have been stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce factory competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustman at the factory, says that his members become more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won't come again."
A spokesman of the government said, "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may have been delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Vice-President of Justice, Rod Rosenstein, can be "shot a week more," as the settlement of the High Court'snominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special charger Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his investigation of Russian election interference, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia and the possible obstacle of the President's court.
Whether Trump will fire the vice-President of Justice and thereby risk Mueller's autonomy, has been a skinny subject in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering to carry microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility to dispose of the President through the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the reputation went on that he wanted to quit.
Instead, a meeting was agreed on Thursday with Trump, which was at the time in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he would "not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a collapse with the Senate's judicial committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual violation, were to witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's choice.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I like always to keep the press updated."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to the game of TV journalists for the gallery, but added: "I don't agree that they are playing up to the camera."
She said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said and added without quoting a source: "We have looked at the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to give it a rich opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in the place of the press meeting when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open consultations or press meetings with high guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made a improvised and sometimes mysterious figure before the present journalists.
The Minister for Health contacts EU staff in the Scottish Health Service after Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has written to the EU staff working in the NHS of Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than a half years before Britain withdraws from the European Union.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to pay for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit continue, and it seems that decisions are expected for autumn.
However, the British Government has also increased their preparation for any Brexit without an agreement.
I know that it must be a very uncertain period for you all.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts made by each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the European Union have valuable experiences and competences to strengthen and improve healthcare work to the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie receives acute surgery after main damage
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely surgered after having had a major damage in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, it reads from Tennessees Mike Organ.
The first coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sidebar and just fell out there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidebar before they put him on a bar and took him for further investigation.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombies operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center had over.
Harris added that there are no "now details about the type or extent of the damage yet," and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he caused the damage.
Abercrombie is studying in the second year and is working on his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five takings on Saturday before leaving the battle, which gives him 18 takings collected this season.
Abroad buyers are charged higher stamp fee when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp fee when they buy a property in the UK. The extra money is to help the homeless, according to the conservative party.
This move has to dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young choosers.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The Ministry of Finance expects that it will provide 120 million pounds a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp fee when buying property in the UK for the benefit of homeless.
The drag will be considered as an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young choosers with promises about cheaper dwellings and walking after them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The revenue from here must be used for the government's struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee imposed above the current stamp fee and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and rental purchases may reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, making prices rise and make it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot in the living market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spooking cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp fee to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies to keep the property prices upwards by buying grounds they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap housing to solve the "shameful housing situation of Britain."
Corbyn has proposed a prominent number of housing reforms, including checks on rental prices and the removal of the lessor's ability to put people on the street if they comply with the lease contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public residential buildings.
May said: "I said last year that I would use my Presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for each generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
United Kingdom will always be open to people who will live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be appropriate that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside Britain to buy homes as for hard working British.
For all too many, the dream of possessing a home has become too far away, and the indignity of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland trainer"
The Chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is at a time to become Scotland trainer.
The 42 shot enjoys the challenge of reliving the club from North East, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light last summer after looking St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country playing.
"I played a battle with the B team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports sound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always pulled in me.
But this option would only arise if I had a success in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors as trainer for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says that he had no concerns about following the so established names in such a large club and had previously rejected the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success on whether I can get this club back in the Premier League."
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not a easy task, but I'll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in the career that trains after a period of assisting training at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of the Heart Trainer Staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after being pulled down into the third best row and transformed St Mirren from the depression threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more pleasant now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real divorce," he remembers the time in Alloa.
"I sincerely thought that the training work was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
That sounds strange because I managed to do well, served sensiblely and had some success experiences.
But it may be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you're going through on a weekly basis.
There is still such stress and pressure that trains, but it feels just right.
I always wanted to train, and now I do it. I haven't felt more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."
You can hear the whole interview at Sportsound on Sunday 30 September at Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturday at 17.30 p.m., shows the study
The heat wave this summer has increased the cost of England's puber, but has put restaurant chains under bigger pressure.
Sales on pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have decreased 4.8%, showing figures.
Peter Martin, a company consultant at the CGA and collected the figures, said: "Continue the sunshine and England's unexpected long VM have meant that July follows the pattern of June, where the pubs experienced more sale of 2.8%, except that the restaurants have been harder hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Puppers and bars focused on the sale of beverages made it clearly best and experienced progress corresponding to the decline of restaurants.
Pumps with focus on food parts in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Throughout pub and bar chains, the sale of beverages increased by 6,6 % for the month, while the food fell by 3,3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the outside-of-home market, weather and major social or sports events are the main factors.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% year by year will make real hurt above increasing costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will give a hardly demanded breathing."
The total increase in sales collected for pubers and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, which shows the decrease in new fires.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for the English pubers, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than 9 billion pounds, and they are leading in the area.
Every five children have a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents
Every fifth child – up to 11 years old – has secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, shows study.
A study of 200,000 students in the 4-9th class reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of adding sexual content
20% of the students said they have a "main account", which they can show their parents
Every fifth child creates accounts on the social media they hide from adults.
A study of 200,000 students from the 4th class and forward reveals a violent growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear of adding sexual content.
20% of the students said they have a "main account", which they can show their parents while also have private.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, saw a teenager who urged others to " rape me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's terrible that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most winning athletics in Scotland, and President Ian Bettie described the change as a good opportunity for those taking decisions on sports to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world in Scotland, United Kingdom and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her in the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the athletes' voice, and I hope that I can contribute and help to achieving a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of its four Olympic Gold Medals in the 200 and 400 metres runs at the OL in Atlanta in 1996, which is now often a commentator for BBC, could not go after a transitoric ice-chemical seizure.
On Twitter he wrote, "A month ago I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time would show if I would get up on it and to what extent.
It's been a hard work, but I'm very healthy, I've learned to go again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers with cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump business has shared the opinions online with an advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first soundless breast pump, the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom of the new pump giving mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a costume full of hooks, to a song in which it is blazing, says, "Yes, I paint myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, this isn't joyful, it's my breasts."
The reconstituted sounds, "Eject it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I paint my merma."
But the advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has led to controversials online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes laughing with the "removals" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they will be pregnant and food before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote a user.
Elvie breast pump fits discretely in a breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: "Reasonably, traumatic enough for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "What a insensitive advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, a woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredible fun."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I would have had one.
Breast-feeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertising directed to mothers pumping milk (often on their workplace or on toilets) and feels like 'cows'.
It's not a advertising that roses or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bh's.
The concept behind the advertising is based on that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly in a breast-bh, which gives women freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The puppy from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a courageous and provoking launch.
By dragging a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while we showed in an entertaining and recognisable way the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time that Elvie's pump has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother to two catwalks went for Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children in secret moved to tent camp at Texas' border
The number of retired migrant children has been exploded, even though the number of border gangers has not changed. This is partly due to a harder retoric and the Trump administration's scraper laws that make it more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to stay in the country by standing up and accepting a child.
The risk of home transmission increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members should give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed to the Congress and told them that they had arrested several people who wanted to sponsor unmanaged minors.
The management later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had pure criminal certificates.
"Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue hunting those people," said Albence.
In the attempt to deal with the children's cases faster, the authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to meet in the court within one month of their retirement.
Many use video calls instead of meeting themselves and speaking their case for legal residence to a immigration judge.
Those who are judged unjustified to stay will be deported quickly.
The longer children are being cautioned, the more likely there is that they get anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or refuge attempts, says from assistants and in reports that have come from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say that these risks are more expressed on larger installations such as Tornillo, where the size makes it difficult to observe if a child suffers.
They added that relocation to a city of tents without mental preparation or opportunity to say goodbye to friends can raise traumas that many are already fighting with.
Syria announces American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" that they should move immediately
When Syria’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-Premier Minister, said that the residence of the foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the defence of combating terrorism, and they will be "confronted with equivalent means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror "neast is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have escaped from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this crucial war until we have cleaned all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "inadvertent foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who principally train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arabic forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the warful country.
In the refugee area, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough to return home, and then he accused "some western countries" to "spread unjustified fear", which led the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these return missions," he said.
"They police what should be a pure humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large rebellious controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political conversations.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack was avoided from Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province where three million lives.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military actions will be followed by jihadists from Nusrafront, a progenitor group of Al-Qaeda, which will be "extinguished".
The United Nations mission Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon call for the first meetings of the new committee to identify a post-war constitution for Syria and to set the path for a choice.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Committee and declares that the panel's work must be limited to "to review the legislation of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another president's period.
Based on this logic Trump is likely to be reselected in 2020, unless the case of the Kingdom law and the scandals end his presidential period before time, which many liberal viewers enough hope for.
In what undoubtedly becomes "The most dramatic end of a presidential period ever!"
At present, there is no sign of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, in the best shipping time, seen figures have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best shipping time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million in evenings with great news.
"It is a spectacular that people are attracted by because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who leads the ABC Drama Designed Survivor about a leader of the cabinet, who becomes president after an attack, destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedie author and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' said Scovell.
Kaosset has an entertainment value.
However, in contrast to all other television programmes, the stories coming from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can reunit and the health of the world economy.
Switching channels is only the most privileged ones.
And yet, it is more than being enlightened citizens when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's bustling jacket for $15,000 ("coated with hybris," wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's living descriptions of Trumps anatomi.
At least I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"Something of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises (squets with N.F.L, praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he took CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, which was to be heard in the Senate Jurisdiction Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows before in time, and people said, "It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find the way to the close mid-term election to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money.
This recently transposed suburban district in Pittsburg creates problems for the democratic representative of Conor Lamb, who won its seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another sitting congress member, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps strongly with the new 17.
The cards were made about after Pennsylvanias High Court in January condemned that the old district was legally set up in the favor of the Republicans.
The struggle on the new 17th district has started a struggle on financial resources between the Committee of the Great Parties, the Campaign of Democrats Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high guardial election in March' special elections for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been on the hands of the Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a little advantage.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador for support to China, but reconsidered
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners cast Trump's management team out.
Officers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Talkwoman of the Foreign Ministry in an announcement earlier in the month.
But only El Salvador was punished. They received about $ 140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cutting financial assistance and restrictions on entrance permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings went forward, North and Central American officials eliminated a top conference on security and economic development, which should continue to be considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in the middle of September, top officials made it clear that they would have the conference to take place anyway, and thus dropped the considerations of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence must speak to the conference planned for mid-October in order to signal the importance of the Americans' meeting, said diplomats.
And the three Americans sent back secretly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard demands or punishment from Washington.
A speaker for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outstanding analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on a condition of anonymity.
Know History
The next obstacle could well be the special charger of Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, which is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller is also claimed to address the question of whether Trump's campaign was secretly cooperating with Russia on the attack on the election.
If the Congress was to come on new hands, Trump would probably be responsible while preparing to meet the voters again and, of course, a jury of his flocks.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trumps is inevitable – and the same applies to his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to engage with a state coup against Hitler if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the checkcos laws in Munich.
We failed and did not take the opportunity to avoid the years of blood bathing afterward.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history turns, and the indispensable march of democracy to or declines.
The United States now faces several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Vice-Judicial Minister Rod Rosenstein?
The seat of Rosenstein has been hot since the present newspaper could announce that he had proposed to make hidden recordings of the President and contempt his suitability for the official.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
"How do we react if the recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh of the F.B.I is suspended or not properly carried out – or if he is approved to the High Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false evidence?
And, more importantly, will we vote at the mid-term election for a congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these trials, it becomes a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who once occupied my ambassador's homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to turn the Sabbath light on the table with the garden cross.
How can I be more than optimistic about it in the baggage?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic before fighting SK Rapid Vienna
Rangers will take on Thursday against SK Rapid Vienna. After the impressive undetermined results in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the month, they will have good opportunities with a victory against the Austrians to get further from Group G of Europe League.
A knee damage prevented the mid-way player Graham Dorrans from getting seasonal debut before the 2-2 struggle against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a jumping board for something even larger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the battle with the belief that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but it was probably a reasonable result.
I guess they were best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
On Thursday, another big European evening will be.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they have a good result in the last battle, but with the audience behind us I am sure that we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can drive on now, put the last season behind us and get success."
Fear of pension saving makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the participants of the study had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared, there were only few who talked to the family about it.
Approximately half of the participants in the Nationalswide survey reported that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent told them to talk to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nations-wide life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not tell them in good time about your wishes.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices may be crucial factors for the costs.
Ask your economic adviser: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, inter alia, by traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-surveillance with your own funds – as long as you have a economy for it.
Get ordered the legal documents: take the legal matches in the race.
Get prepared a full power so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, if you are not able to communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic power.
In that case, you will designate a trusted person who can make economic decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aged parents needs medical help and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all of these details in writing, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question about the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who's the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a tour in the city.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the middle floor and the hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 02.30, as "the whole random."
The victim didn't see the devil man.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police urge witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamia in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. It tells the authorities that expect the number of killers to rise.
Since the communications routes are out of play, emergency staff have not been able to receive information from the Donggla regentship, a region north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesian province and is located in the bottom of a narrow bucket on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379.800.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami hit.
Donggla is a rulership that extends more than 300 km of the coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The rule, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basic pillars of the central Sulawess economy, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel recovery is also important in the province, but is mainly taking place in Morowali, which is opposite the coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggla have, according to Indonesia’s disaster centre, been affected by tsunamia several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggal was again hit by a tsunami who killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically on the so - called ignition in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in the northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in the end of March and until April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake that measured 6.8, hit south of Java, Indonesia's most closely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that brought to the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake measured 7.5, one of the Mentawai islands hit out of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya rule in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of the 2004 deadly earthquakes and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the colliding buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily on the beach.
Sarah Palins Oldest Son aimed for violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspicion of violence in the home, obstacle to the notification of violence in the home and to resist arrest, according to the report sent by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a woman's familiar when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is caught in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a deposit of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was sent to the court on Saturday, when he declared himself "absolutely not guilty," reports the network.
Palin is charged for three class A infringements that can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250.000.
He has also been sentenced for a class B infringement that can lead to a punishment on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin has been sentenced for infringements.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently under consideration at Alaskas Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was aimed at violence at home, preventing the notification of a violent crime at home and the possession of weapons in the affected state of the event.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a hit in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after a earthquake on Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication paths, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit right south of the central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media there are videos that show the moment when the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami went to the coast.
Public prosecutors try to get terrorist suspects in NYC sentenced rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to be sentenced death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terror attack in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare penalty that was last sentenced for a crime in the state in 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov used a rental car from the construction market Home Depot in October to accommodate an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists, who came in the way, were met down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the chargers must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious personal injury, which is required by the deliberate declaration of death penalties in the southern district of New York.
According to the legal document, death penalty is a possible result of both of these claims.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov for an appeal of 22 points, under which eight charges of murder in the case of gangsters were used typically by public accused by organised crime cases, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "reasonable planning and preparations", said the chargers and described Saipov's execution as "unholy, evil and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, body damage and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the Declaration of Intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's a decade ago that New York's southern district last traveled in a case of death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for murder of two drug providers, but ended with lifelong penalty in September 2009.
The death penalty was last sentenced in a state case in New York in 1953. Then the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced for spying on behalf of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg pair was executed in the electric chair on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, did not show any evidence of repentance in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said to the investigators that he was good with his deeds.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, told the officers.
He refused to be guilty of the 22 points of the accusation.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defence officers, announced that they were "naturally disappointed" of the decision of the chargers.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life-long penalty without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the chargers not to go after death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that the politicians had to be able to "mark the pressure" of the Euro-Skeptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the European Union.
The Conservative Member Peter Bone said to the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom would have "been out now", if Farage had been Brexit dealer.
May's challenge to create a collection in the deep split party is underlined by the fact that conservative remains participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his compromise plan on track under attacks from both brexites, remains and the European Union.
Her alliated insists that, despite the relapse, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thereby force the Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package or "caos".
For the demonstration, Leave Means Leave in Solihole, Bone announced that he would scratch the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added: "I want to fight for Brexit, but we have to scratch Chequers."
Concerning the background of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars for being the subject of someone.
We will decide our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected that the public's position should have changed since the 2016 vote: "The British people should have changed their opinion and wish to remain in the European Union is completely wrong."
The Conservative Brexite Andrea Jenkyns was also for the demonstration and told the journalists: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is upopular in the wide population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is upopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us chosen in.
Now drop Chequers and start listening.'
As a point of remark to May, she added: "Premier Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the tour that the politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail to vote in 2016.
"Now it is a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They will betray Brexit, but we're gathered to tell them that we don't let them go."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class, which is on the tip to betray Brexit, can feel the pressure.
"We mobilise the army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-controlled and proud United Kingdom."
While marched remains through Birmingham before a two-hour recording in the city centre.
Spreaded activists vibrated with Conservative Mod Brexit-banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis was laughing before the meeting with the security problems of the conservatives' party app.
"They are the people who claim that they have control over the IT systems and the technology for Canada, the border controls, the free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's all to laugh.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to set up the presidential elections
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to set up the presidential election" after the mid-term election in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democrats of Massachusetts spoke about their future during a city council meeting on Saturday in the western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, must in November try to get a revelation against the state’s Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been wondered if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters in the council since Trump took over the office.
A participant asked her if she planned to set up the presidential election.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front."
Arrest in case of shot breaks on LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced Saturday that Friday a suspect was arrested for the shot murder at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they had released a video of the shooting to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by shots in his head and died of the damages," said police officer Murphy J. Paul according to the media 247 sports.
Wayde took action to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to be present, possessing a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without trouble and is now in the police in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two meters high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. In the last season he played 32 matches, started in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's grand prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the world championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment when Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a decisive role in the race.
From the driver's position, Bottas got a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton completely off when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in pit as the first, and let Hamilton fight with the traffic at the end of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went in the pit a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front when the Ferrari runner, after some wheel contact, had to leave the indoor track after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round on his 21-year birthday.
Then he led into a large part of the race when he failed to change tyres in an attempt on a fast end to take Kimi Raikkonen’s fourth place.
He had to pit at the 44th round, but could not increase the rate of the last eight rounds, why the Raikkon secured the fourth place.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri did it amazing all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team made an incredible piece of work to ensure us both the first and the second place," said Hamilton.
Real bad body language
President Donald Trump insulted senator Dianne Feinstein at a voter meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not deceived the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the High Court'snominant Brett Kavanaugh of sex abuse.
At a electoral meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to the witness statement given by Ford before the Senate of the United States, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "bad and dishonest and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days of the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are anger and evil and dishonest and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you that leaked it?
Remember her answer... was it you that leaked the document – "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't tasted anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked anything," he added to a simulation of the senator.
Feinstein was sent back the letter about Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't delighted her story," said Feinstein to the comee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I've done that."
But her denial was not well received by the President, who said at the Saturday election meeting: "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the President's continued defence of the nominated judge at the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual violation by three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own case.
"They don't shoot any means in their efforts to take the power back.
You can see the evil, the disgusting things they don't care who they're going to tromle to get power and control," said the President according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it again after Friday's lost Elite League battle against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants arrived quickly with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were compliant at home before Dwyer brought Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came back to hit Dundee 2-1 in the Friday fight in Belfast.
It was the fourth season meeting between the sides where Giants went out as victories in the three previous matches.
Dwyer posted out for the fourth minute of 3:35 from a assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assist, when Beauvillier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt stood behind the Cownies compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants came in front at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Boochard recompensed with a great goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated in helping Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the battle late in the second period, and he guaranteed the victory with the fifth goals of the team halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five matches, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next fight on Friday.
Airlines died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia is celebrated as a whole after he died to ensure that a plane of hundreds of passengers came safely down on the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a larger earthquake in Friday, the Sulawesi island hit and triggered a tsunami.
Strong descendants still ruin the area, and many are caught in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agungs colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his place in the sweating control tower in the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He got back in his place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was holding on the startway, was safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
President of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said, according to the Australian ABC News, that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broken," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, and the country's disaster preparedness announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggla, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six feet high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes fly in emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops are plundered."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we come to.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's president Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the day to carry out all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier in the year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says that a man is missed after the flight crash in the lagune
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Lagune of the Pacific in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, even though it had been previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the falling plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini says that Saturday afternoon it could not find a male passenger.
The airline announced cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned on requests for more information on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local both helped to save the other passengers and the crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officers said Friday that seven people were driving in the hospital.
The airline says that six passengers stayed in the hospital for Saturday and that they were all in a stable state.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of the events.
The airline and the U.S. Marine both declare that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the landing path.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was flying by the runway.
The U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was landing on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go in water to life to get to the emergency exits of the falling plane.
He said the crew was panicing and crying, and he had had a smaller head damage.
The U.S. Marine said that sailors who worked on renovating a cage nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to ask people in land before the plane dropped on about 30 meters depth.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 persons have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines during the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analytics define the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his proof on Saturday during the prosecution of a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analytics at the US Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, made witness statements for several hours as experts in data analysis.
He described for the jury how he used teleinfos to merge the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the evening she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed that he and his friend Michael Sanford visited the police Sanford.
Sanford was sitting in the testimony on Saturday and told him he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis spoke the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that evening, Sanford said he was lying 'cause my truck was in Nashville'.
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at a time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He deleted her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is planned to start its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is political hiphop?
A hiphoptrio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in Britain because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Child girl in New York inquiries couples for fire with "racist" SMS
A child girl in New York appeals to a couple of discriminatory fires after having sent a message by an error from the mother who complained that she was "and another black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the case with "depreciation".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is a mother of two, expressed her fear of finding out that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEJ, NOT ENDNU A SORT PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their former baby girl, from Africa-American, had been bad for her work, and that instead she expected a philipse, according to New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day work and sent home in an Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice's parliament seeks reimbursement for the fire and compensation for $350 a day for the six months in which she should have lived with the family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I would like to show them that you can't allow yourself to do such a thing," she said to the newspaper Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple defended themselves with the fact that they were not racists and that the fire of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they wouldn't trust her after being offended.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been obsessed with, even if it had happened by a mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, honestly."
Plasco compared the case with "depreciation" and that his wife had born two months before and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after someone like that?
This is not particularly kindly done," added the investment adviser.
Although the case is still in progress, the Court of Justice has already declined the parliament on social media and harmed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers could not relate to a speaking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted to release, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine to be the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's pretty fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at BBC, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little clothing bams, would have been optimistic, although his story was rejected, and that the 60th year for the publication of the books was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modestness was proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to praise," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt almost as if you had a child who achieved something: You're proud of them, although it's not really your gain.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity like that.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Say goodbye to the dying daughter over the phone
After landing, her daughter was driven to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors in vain attempted to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes, and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll see you again soon.
See you later.
The medicine she had received to keep her heart started, slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now her body shut down.
I just had to sit there waiting for it to happen.
I couldn't shout or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together."
Finally, the mourning Ednan-Laperouse went on board the plane with the other passengers who didn't know what she was going through.
"Nobody knew it," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears continued running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women try to stop suicide shoppers
Two women who have lost their relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a whalelic bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he was depressed, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I endure every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promised cook with an infected smile.
"He's smile was known by everyone.
People said his smile blowed up the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him when he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "telling people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis's many-year-old friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her girlfriend through 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about that he was sorry or depressed or something," she said.
"Some days before Christmas he began to change.
When the kids opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but they have to get through it, "It has created a hole in our family.
It has revenged us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear, while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited time study with a limited extent – we might have a little consensus," said Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the coma "falled from the hind" in the midst of the locked partial situation.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican support the FBI's investigation?
Their retention is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, are bad, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have chosen as the highest judge of the country.
George W. Bush called senators to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has completed his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice-President Mike Pence the decisive vote and choose him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean afhoppers 'fall' under Kim Jong-un
The number of Northern Korean hoppers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Cohesion and said there were 1.127 descents last year compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher figures due to traffickers contributed to the changed figures.
Pyongyang hasn't given any official comments.
In time, the majority of the hips from North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean Government states that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most people fly through China, which has the longest border up to North Korea and which is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the hopes to be illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often compulsory.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is still technically in war – has been significantly improved in the last few months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met to talk about the beached negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea at a global level.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. penalties for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States there is no faith in our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we will defeat on our own," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh for "hysterical" and says he's inappropriate for the High Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the High Court of Justice, for "hysterical" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the High Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview on Saturday to Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, one would have called her hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness statement before the Senate's court committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the emotional accusations that he had committed a sexual violation of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "great and coordinated character courage" arranged by the left fleet who was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was pre-intentioned against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after the Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi went beyond when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh for a Kingdom law if he was confirmed and if the Democrats were given a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say that if he does not speak true to the Congress or the FBI, he is not suitable to sit in the High Court, but certainly also in the court he is sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Appeal Court of Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions concerning Obama's health reform or abortion case Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the consultations, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reconcile certain former Supreme Court decisions.
"It mustn't happen that a hysterical, pre-intained person has to argue a job as a judge and expect us to say 'jamen, it's not just nice'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, several months' and year's anger that chambers over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I got a great support from a woman who was the boss who said that she was also crying when she became angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began crying, she would say to the one she was talking to, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstanded.
One of my most clear memories is from one of my first jobs in a office with a overweight of men, where I often cried of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss, which I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see that you're crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll please that they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Congress of Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed in having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and pulled himself as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and found that she could as well set up as a president candidate.
"It wasn't a very thought-out decision," she said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly didn't need another candidate.
Some called it Snow-White and the seven dwarfs."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was back with fundraising, so she promised that she would not participate unless she collected 2 million dollars.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her support, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she thought.
When she kept a speech that she wouldn't stop, she was overwhelmed by feelings – thankfulness for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to travel money and reach electors instead of electors, and anger over sexism – that she got a clump in her neck.
"You could think I had a nervous interaction," remembers Schroeder how the press responded to her.
"You should think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what's going to be writing on my grave stone?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can be a advantage for Beijing
The opening salves in the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and even though the battle is far from over, spread between countries can be a benefit for Beijing in the long run, says experts.
The U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by placing customs duties on important Chinese export products, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest escale this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of $200 billion, applies in principle to half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing has made rewards every time, at last by adding customs duties of 5-10% on US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second largest economy probably does not give after just ahead.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its claims, it means they give up, but for China's president, Xi Jinping, it will be too embarrassing to bow down for the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a crude for a economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it is actually much more dangerous than one thought," said Abigail Grace, researcher with focus on Asia at the thought centre for New American Security.
Syria is 'klare' to receive refugees, believes the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready for refugees to return and ask for help to build the country destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country were better.
"Today, the situation is more stable and safe thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working on recreating a normal state.
All conditions are now present for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily and lifebread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since 2011 when the war began.
Additional six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian Government would like to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept contingent aid or aid from countries that contributed to supporting the rebellion.
Europe ensures Clearer Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and hit the American team 16.5 - 10,5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a single Cleaner Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14,5 points, it required to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had it hard at most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on pair 3 on the 16th hole, which led him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have been given5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest rated European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Number 1 on the world order list, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the baggage, Spainrd Sergio Garcia, became the most winning Europeans with 25.5 career points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't do for it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It is a team effort, and I am pleased that I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the fake to his countryman John Ram, who fell the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud of having hit Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Cleaner Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a spooking statistics for one of the best golf players who've ever won 14 big titles, only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had the whole weekend problems finding the shape with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing show, "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the matter.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe counterparts.
We lost.
The hatred of Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players were really good.
We will regroup and I will cooperate with the PGA of America and our Cleaner Cup Committee, and then we will continue.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud of being their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
We were defeated."
