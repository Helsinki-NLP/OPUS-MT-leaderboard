Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear interference with the Muppets
In some Members of the National Assembly, the proposal to amend their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) is disadvantaged.
This is why plans are to change the name of the National Assembly to 'Welsh Parliament' (Walsh Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political directions fear to become the target disc of spot.
A national assembly member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name “twp” and “Pwp” is rhyming.
For non-walisian readers: "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A national assembly member of the Party Plaid Cymru indicated that the whole group was “not happy” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was unlocked against the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the valian letter w is similar to the letter u in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which currently constructs a law on the change in names, said: "The final decision on the names of the national meeting members is obviously with the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" of the National Assembly was given.
With regard to the title of the National Assembly members, the Board of Welsh Parliaments (Walisian Members) or WMPs preferred, while a public hearing of the MWP option was the greatest support.
The members of the National Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but the ring for a consensus to the chairman of Elin Jones, who is supposed to present a draft law within weeks, could be a problem.
The reform legislation will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for disqualification of national meeting members and for the design of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was launched to settle a decades of dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the same name as Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim is raised to the Greek territory and has repeatedly expressed itself against its inclusion in the EU and the NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he would not recognise the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people with whom I spoke said, in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” said Adams.
"Today there are no more both."
He said the disappearance of the bars is complete.
"The social life of people looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood, where people find themselves regularly."
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets is not enough as long as the church leaders assume, and that they “will be at the beginning before or afterwards”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with property apartments in which people who do not support the remaining refugees.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy property homes in these buildings will be whites,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these property apartments will be members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropole: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's one decade later.
In the 1930s, the original white metodist community went out.
A black municipality who held their worship nearby became owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who directed a boykott by retailers in the 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to set up or support black ones.
When a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson’s municipality members planned the reconstruction, they ordered the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who spoke of the bell game in July used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "a indispensable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, found that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, which had changed to the larger bell game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been played in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, which have been attracted partly by the leaders of the church and partly by the Bishop diocese.
In July, the municipal board of directors of the municipality expressed written concerns to the Diözese that the Diözese would try to transfer the costs to the municipal board, although it had not been involved in the task of the architects and contractors sent by the Diözese.
Some commune members complain about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds due to praise
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, a 13-year-old boy attacked a shark on the diving to Lobster, according to official statements.
The attack took place near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas shortly before 7:00.
As Chad Hammel told the transmitter of KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been with friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy's help yell and with several others paddled to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was happy to have caught a lobby, but then he realized that the boy cried “I’ve been biten!
I've been biten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire key leg had been broken up.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flying to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Captain Larry Giles said to the media that a few weeks before had been seen a shark in the area, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
For investigation purposes and for safety reasons, officials locked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but mostly not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans ahead of the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks cosmetics that are occupied with specialized assistants, boats, superdrug and debenhams.
In the framework of a large advanced cosmetic market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, while fashion and budget revenues decrease, the larger cosmetic divisions are tested in 11 branches across the country. If they prove successful, they will be expanded to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics is combined with the search of supermarkets for possibilities to use previously used shop areas used for television, microwave and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the extent of his cosmetic offer is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Available series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's bees also receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket runs a relaunch of its makeup series “Boutique” so that most of the products are veganer-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the parfum dealer Fragrance shop will be tested in two Sainsbury's films. The first sales station was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and a second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, next year.
Online shopping and the transition to daily purchase of small amounts of food in local needs articles means that supermarkets need to do more to make customers visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales stations are increasingly looking like shopping houses, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight against the discounter Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food articles.
Sainsbury's has set up a number of Habitat sales stations in hundreds of branches Argos since the purchase of the chains Argos and Habitat chains two years ago. This has increased food sales as well as the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, but after a discussion on the distribution of revenues from the branches of the drug dealer in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branches comprehensive pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million UK pounds three years ago.
The company claimed that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in so far as an extended range of luxury-heading marks, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetics divisions to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues available as consultants.
Our brand palette is cut to all needs. Because of the attractive environment and the favourable locations, we are now an attractive target for cosmetic purchases that question the former kind of shopping."
Peter Jones ‘wild’ after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughby from a business worth 11 million British pounds
“Dragons” The” Star Peter Jones is “angry” after TVModerator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning” Moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby irritated “Dragons” The” Star Peter Jones by their very short-term withdrawal from their lucrative lifestyle brands company to focus on their own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is supposed to have been “angry” when the “Golden Girl” of the TV was awarded at a thrilled meeting on Tuesday in the central of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, because of her new businesses – worth up to 1.5 million British pounds – to not be able to dedicate the common homewear and accessories brand Truly enough time.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced their withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his holidays.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly.
It should ensure its future for them over the next decades.
Their decision for withdrawal was completely surprising for all stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, as soon as before the introduction of the market.
In the centre of Marlow, a warehouse of goods is waiting for sale."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning”Moderator, one of the most promising Stars of Great Britain, could cost the company millions because of high investments in products from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in the introduction of the market.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been closely friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, came as Chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a proportion of 40 percent in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand messenger for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a moderator of the ITV broadcast "I'm A Celebrity".
A nearby source of Jones said yesterday evening: "We don't comment on his business matters."
Hard words “and then we have loved”
He shouted about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment which some would view as "non-president" and for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said the voice of a newsmoderator following:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore in June of Trump was praised as a great step towards Denuklearisation of North Korea.
However, the denuclearing negotiations have been put into stock.
Over three months after the June Summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the highest diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world at the UN General Assembly that the north is not a "compliant reaction" of the United States on North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted that the United States held penalties to maintain pressure.
Trump proved much more optimistic in his announcement.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were in front of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: end of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and return of the deadly survivors of American military members.
In addition, he defended his unusual way of speaking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 100,000 people who stand outside and try to enter this overfilled arena, about 200 people would stand here," said Trump and pointed to the crowd right before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes destroy an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
For example, after the earthquake of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they would not be used.
Although more than 10 percent of the population were distributed by Lombok, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilisation of international aid.
"They have in many cases made very clear that they do not demand international support, so that is something difficult," said Sumpting.
While Save the Children set up a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure whether foreign employees can work locally.
Sutopo, speaker of the Cascade Protection Authority, said that indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international bodies would be able to participate in the aid measures.
Given the shakings of the earth with which Indonesia is constantly fighting, the country is still badly prepared for natural violence.
While Tsunami protection accommodations were built in Aceh, they are not everyday views on other coastal stripes.
The tsunami warnsirene in Palu, apparently missing in spite of a warning, has probably contributed to the deaths.
Tours between Indonesia’s many islands are already a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A lazarett ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will reach the place of the new disaster in three days at least.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the affected Indonesian infrastructure a core piece of his electoral campaign and has used plenty of money for roads and railways.
However, the government of the Joko seeking re-electives next year suffers from financial deficiencies.
In addition, Joko is under pressure by persistent confession tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practise a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and expelled tens of thousands from their houses and apartments, when bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with Machets, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday in the London Stamford Bridge City with a hit in the 89th minute before a premier League lose against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri at the 0:1-back of his team at about 27 meters from Chelsea's gate.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the back fountain.
The shot sailed high above the penal room and operated in the right upper corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"I just tried to bring myself to this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for me," said Sturridge against LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edges come and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just accepted the shot."
After a hit in the 25th minute, Chelsea led through the Belgian Star Eden Hazard at half time with 1:0.
The Blues storm gave a passport with the feather back to Mateo, then turned down near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle of the field.
Then he shot a good steep passport, so that danger came into the penalty room.
Hazard left the defenders behind and shut down with a left shot on Liverpools Alisson Becker behind the network.
Liverpool plays at the Champions League's group phase on Wednesday 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea stands at Thursday at 15:00 in London in the UEFA Europe League videoton.
Number of death victims of Tsunamis in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of death victims of earthquake and Tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the Disaster Protection Authority on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to have been captured in the troughs of buildings that had been brought to an invasion by the earthquake of the starch 7.5 from Friday, which had triggered up to six metres high waves, the public speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 3800,000 inhabitants, was overseated with the debris crashed buildings.

The police urge the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early phase, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and who have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all people, especially taxi drivers who may have taken up something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of great importance for our investigation."
A police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and found in a building.
Today's afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman have arrived at the Tatort to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing, and the police informed that she was informing the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The inhabitants are now informed that it will take hours until they can enter the building again.

The Cromwell State before Parliament will be the most recent monument of the dispute about rewriting history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for its destruction of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious art products of England through its fanatic puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "tourness" and "a attempt to rewrite the history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell was a goal in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The picturestorm in the English civil wars was not arranged or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful representation of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion and part of the historical description of a figure which many still think it is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today than someone who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case, of course through the monarchy.
Whether it is a fully appropriate representation, it is the subject of continued history debates.
Surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognisable figure that represents a side of this climb.
His services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating them and remembering them."
Killing pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in the southwest of China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man whose surname was only called "Yuan" was discovered with a diluted artery of blood flowing near a pig stall on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is ready to inject pig vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
According to reports on Wednesday, he and his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan were traveling to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighbouring pig bar was open.
He said there was a great male pig in the stack with blood on the snause.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 pounds of heavy pig had killed farmers.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and stumbled," the cousin, by which the surname was called "Wu", was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Recording a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged neither to Yuan nor to his cousin.
A market manager said the Evening News that the pig had been locked in order to prevent attacks on other people, while the police collected evidence at the site.
Yuans family and market authorities negotiate reports on a compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 pounds [290 pounds] heavy pig crammed a whaleous farmer between himself and a tractor until the wife of the farmer could excavate the animal.
After a farmer was eaten from his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a "exploitant".
“They're only lost.
They like to twist and are very curious, ... they're not about to hurt someone.
You only have to treat them with the right level of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurrikan Rosa bring widespread strong rains in the southwest of the USA
As predicted, Hurrikan Rosa is weakened on the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring overflows of rainfall in North Mexico and the Southwest of the USA in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 eastern coastal time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to an orchard of category 1, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa moves north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a troop begins to be drawn across the Pacific towards the east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported to the north in the southwest of the USA.
Rosa will trigger rainfall on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 25 cm.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical moisture generates strong rainfall in the southwest by interactions with the trailing trog.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous fluid floods, water-driving shots and possibly earthweeds in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to downturn rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centuries per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, rainfall is expected up to 5 to 10 centimeters.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of fluid floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Given the threatening tropical rainfall, it is urgently advised to go to the wilderness.
Strong rainfall can cause canyon’s ragging streams, and the weather brings local wind beaches as well as the wind that leads dust.
The nearing trog brings strong rains to parts of the southern Californic coast.
The total amount of downturns may be over a centimeter which can lead to shots running in water and smooth paths to a small extent.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainfall in this region.
The first single tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it is widely raining.
On Tuesday strong rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and continues on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools off while the tropes remain relatively hot.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the USA.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 12 oC.
In the next days, the ongoing summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the USA a warm October beginning with wide-spread temperatures of 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast is expected.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of excessive temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern USA.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, over 20 million viewers have seen the fascinating statements of the Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual violations in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political patch situation stopped. On Friday, television broadcasters interrupted their regular program because of a turning in the last minute: a agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, thus the FBI is to carry out a weekly investigation of the accusations.
Ford announced the Senate Jurisdiction Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, had pressed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average accompanying figures at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewers' numbers in offices.
To put this in the right perspective: This corresponds to the number of viewers in a play-off football game or in the Oscar award.
The broadcaster Fox News Channel, whose intent-oriented moders strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, says Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the whole day hearing, reported the highest numbers of all networks.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS reported Nielsen had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After publishing a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the office of the moderate Republicaner was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, as protesters pressed him in the wheelchair on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee with words.
He stood for minutes with a lower view while he was swallowed. The scene was transferred live at CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said a woman.
"Do you believe that he tells the country the truth?"
"You have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said that his office published a statement and supplemented before the elevator concluded that he would have to say more at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks sent live hours later when the Jurisdiction Committee was to vote on the continuation of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote on the whole Senate.
Flake, however, said that he would do this only under the condition that the FBI demands the accusations against the candidates in the next week as from the democratic minority.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with a friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and then different senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was evident that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has led a FBI investigation of the accusations raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics to use Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times Critics, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her plans for exiting the European Union to use the future of Great Britain for political purposes and to undermine the interests of the nation.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May meets on 29 September 2018 on the day of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In another interview published on the title page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson intensified its attack on her so-called "Chequers-Plan" for the Brexit by calling a proposal for the mutual acquisition of customs duties by Britain and the EU as "full of absurd".
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police takes Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
In connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU), the police arrested a suspicious.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested by Baton Rouge for death.
The Authority published video recordings of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reports, the police secured the glasses at the site and said that the bricks had been found on the DNA of Simpson.
After a survey of Simpson, the police indicated that he had the deadly shots on way.
The lawyer reports that the deposit was fixed to $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to the cause of death, a shot wound on the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police Laboratory, Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to arrest.
LSU Port Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive authority for “their care and their pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 m large wings player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball.
During the last season, he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball trainer of the LSU said that Will Wade's team was shaken over Waydes' death and "standing in shock".
"There is always a fear of such a thing," said Wade.
The volcano cooks ash in Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to keep away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the Krater and was registered within 24 hours 183 outlets of gas and ash.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of grools and shocks.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windscreens of cars in quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Since September 2017, a earthquake had shocked 7.1 Central Mexico, Geophysics identified increased activity on the 72 kilometres southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independent vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after conflicts between the police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands took part in other demonstrations to remind the first anniversary of the Polarising Independence Referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-Separatists, held by the prepared police, threw them with eggs and also swallowed color powder, so that in the normally populated streets of tourists, dark dust clouds occurred.
In the next day, there were also hand joints with the police who used their battleheads to hamper the battle.
For several hours, pro-independence groups “No forgotten, no forgiveness” were scanned, while Unionists called “Long Live Spain”.
As reported by the local press, fourteen people were treated for smaller injuries in protests.
However, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid has seen as illegal, but has been celebrated by separateist catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very excited.
The electorates had decided with an overwhelming majority for independence, although the electoral participation was low, as the opponents were mostly boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent conflicts before the electoral premises.
Pro-independence groups had struggled in the outdoor on Friday overnight to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in protest of the separatists, said that he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“We have experienced one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they were able to choose, but now we are attached," he said.
Despite an important, though also small, victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan Pro-Independence Parties had difficulties in maintaining the swing this year. Many of their most famous leaders are either in the exile or in prison, where they are waiting for their procedures because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest to the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been ceased by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more stressed," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were in investigation since the end of last year, announced his candidate for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European election, the best way is to decline the democratic values and the oppression of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after the house of car had been caught
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been caught several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 after British summer time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, it may have been shot on the car with a brain.
Menga-Treffer means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first gate for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hits proved decisive for Gary Holt's crew to be able to draw like Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's crew remains in this season without outward victory in the premiership and faces the next Sunday the hearts, which are behind the eight points.
Previously on Thursday, the Rangers in Europe League are hosts for Rapid Vienna.
Livingston can in the meantime increase his victory series in the division to six games, i.e. Chieftrainer Holt has not yet been defeated since his acquisition by Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against boldly playing guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the meeting, as its directness the Rangers faced the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but was slower in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he had been shot here to meet Craig Halkett's headhead on the gate.
The hosts were pleased to let the rankers play before themselves, as they knew they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate came.
The Rangers allowed an outgoing, and Livingston prepared a chance at which Declan Gallagher and Robinson brought Menga together in a shooting position. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the criminal area.
In this phase the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but the host's defense could not overcome, and Torhüter Liam Kelly was largely unhealthy.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to defend.
Scott Pittman was defended by Rangers-Torhüter Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow passed the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanks came back to Livingston's penalty room and were regularly brought out of the danger area, while two criminal offences required – one of Halketts against Glenn Middleton and one because of handplay – were refused.
“Penomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have again exceeded the expectations of this upward trend.
Their plays and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt pays great praise for the way he has watched the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led to an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on trab during the whole game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as at times they were under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the crew of the hosts – and that is something like a wake call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan with mixed reactions received in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) smiling faces and blue skys reigned when the heads of the government of Turkey and Germany in Berlin came to breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between the NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and accession to Turkey.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for preventing a 25,000 people from gathering before the mosque. However, many attendants found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurden – also listened. They condemned Erdogan's politics as well as the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, praised by some German dryers as heroes and smashed by others as autocrates.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicycles die in collision with car
In a crash with a car, a cyclist died in London.
The collapse occurred at about 10:15 p.m. of the British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a transportable road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the sanitary cared for the man who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another bicycler had died in an accident with a rider flight in the Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident from Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next family.
Road locks and redirects for buses are set up, and car drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officials injured in disturbance
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in a high-security prison for men.
The disturbances broke out on Sunday at 9:30 p.m. in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stands.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were attracted to end the disturbances involved in eight inmates and restricted to a wing.
The officials were treated locally because of smaller injuries in the face.
A spokesman of the prison service said: “It was specially trained prison staff to fix an event still ongoing in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to clarify that police officers will be handed over and may spend longer time behind grids."
In HMP Long Lartin, there are over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison leader was reported to have been treated by a prisoner in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, operations officers were sent to prison to deal with severe disturbances in which staff with pool balls were attacked.
Hurrikan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flute floods (through areas may benefit)
It rarely occurs that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but exactly that will probably happen at the beginning of the next week when the rest of Hurrikan Rosa moves over the southwest of the desert and brings the risk of fluid floods.
The National Weather Service has already published warnings against fluid floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada and southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa approaches with rain on Monday evening and moves directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a Tweet that “from 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come near as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix to 320 miles [320 km]!
Katrina (1967) was a horrican within 64 kilometres from Arizona's border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall with up to 15 centuries in the Mogolon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestly deserted, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm and can be combined in total up to 10 centimeters.
For those who do not risk fluid flooding, the rainfall associated with Rosa may be a blessing because of the drying in the region.
Although flooding is a great concern, this rain is likely to be useful, as it is currently dry in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, in some more than 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drying occurs, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
Firstly, the path of the Hurricane means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have a maximum of 136 kilometres per hour and will be 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the Hurricane will move north with 19 kilometres per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet on colder water and thus weaken.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The precipitation can be strong in parts of Mexico, so that there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, rainfall sums are expected from 7.5 to 15 centuries, allowing up to 25 centimeters”, reported weather.com.
Then Rosa as a tropical storm will move across Mexico in the north, as a tropical depression in the early Tuesday morning, reach the border to Arizona and then move through Arizona to the south of Utah until the late Tuesday night.
“The main danger is to be expected in connection with Rosa or its remains to be very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert and the southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of these rainfall, life-threatening flute floods and water-driving shots are expected in the desert as well as in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teenage was injured on Saturday at 4:00 in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was brought to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the wheelstock area.
The officials asked everyone who had records of events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered “under the community, the anger” of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the credible and unheared techniques of Democrats," said Trump at a contest in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered “under the community, the anger” of the Democrats during the entire nomination process.
On Thursday before the convention, Kavanaugh rejected the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually distressed them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also said to her accusation at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh this day.
"A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for confirming one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance sheet in the service of the public," he said the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the intermediate elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our life.
I don't touch, but in reality I'm approaching," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission to "compare and block resistance".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place at the Senate at the latest on Friday, said a high employee of the GOP's leadership against CNN.
Hundreds of earthquakes killed in Indonesia, victims rising
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were swept away when, due to a strong earthquake and a tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there were gigantic waves on the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered together on Friday at a festival at the beach of the city of Palu, when the darkness blowed up to six meters of waves on the beach, rising many people to death and destroying everything that was in their way.
A earthquake of the strength of 7.5 had preceded the Tsunami.
“When yesterday the threat of the Tsunami came up, people still went on the beach and didn’t run away immediately, and they fell to him as a victim," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian Disaster Protection Authority GDP at a conference in Jakarta.
“The Tsunami did not come alone, he swemmed cars, tree tribes and houses, he met everything on land,” said Nugroho. He added that the Tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he met to the coast.
Some people were climbed on trees on the escape from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated and lived in 24 centers in Palu.
Air captures published by the disaster protection authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, verbose and crashed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further descendants.
The earthquake series was experienced in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Authority BPPT (Agent for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in an explanation that the energy released by the massive quake from Friday has responded to the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb thrown on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the Tsunami could have grown larger, the Authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as “reasonable” and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were crashed.
According to his statement, the bodies of some victims were found among the crushed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damages could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area named Dongga, closer to the epicenter of the quake.
According to Nugrohos, communication with Donggla was completely paralyzed, and there was no information.
According to a Declaration by the Red Cross, more than 300 000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on the way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," said the explanation.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticized for not having informed that a Tsunami had met Palu, although the waves were officially found at the time of the warning.
Amateur recordings published in social media show a man in the upper floor of a building who desperately warns the people on the road under him from the nearby tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall works on the shore and swims buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
Through the bidding and the tsunami, a massive power loss occurred that interrupted the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military began to send freight aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other viable goods.
The city airport remains closed until October and was reopened only for assistance.
For Sunday, President Joko Widodo's visit was planned to evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where the employees are in tent accommodations in their office, but according to the words of Dosebas, on the way to scenes of destruction.
“They told me they had seen many destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the helping groups began to start the catastrophe aid with the hard task, some believed that expert foreign assistants would be obliged to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, delivery and staff from abroad are only possible if the place of an accident has been explained to the national disaster area.
This has not happened until now.
"On the moment it is another disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but this status does not apply until now.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the Tsunami of Friday dropped over Palu, friends and family members of those who were still missing for one of the miracles that lighten up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a sewage channel.
On Sunday, a woman freed a rescue force that was clamped up in the body of her mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paraglider for the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Others who were prisoners in the Roa-Roa hotel, as Mandagi supplemented, were his students.
“As a senior at the paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to carry,” he said.
Gendon told me how he was doing the round in the hours after the message of the invasion of the Roa Roa Hotel among the paragliders, a desperate WhatsApp messages sent to the contesting participants from Palu who attended the beach festival.
His news, however, led to gray question marks instead of blue hacks.
"I think that means that the news were not delivered," he said.

According to a press release from the Newport Police Office on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Diebe a Brink’s employee when filling a money machine 26.750 US dollars.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a money machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to make more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came behind the employee of Brink’s” and stole a bag full of money that was intended for the automation.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee from the site, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
People who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the police of Newport under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The being officially known as Canye West).
West, 41, has been using the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth albums published in June.
The change predicts his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the publication of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
He appears in the shipment as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has canceled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not just a shortening of his current professional name, but it has a religious significance for the West, according to its own own statement.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with radiomoderator Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it's us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only’, only ‘Ye’ – just a reflection of our good, our badness, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was announced under the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with which West had collaborated earlier, has also written his name with and without binding and uppercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to apply military violence against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of bloody repressals against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers had fired on October 2, 1968 for a peaceful demonstration on the site and killed 300 people. At that time, left-right student movements were setting up throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training possibilities led young people to criminal bands.
The United States should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's enhanced activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its expenditure on research in this area, says investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who was active in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow on AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even if the United States generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented his plan last year: The country intends to become the 1 in the field of KI innovation by 2030.
"The duplicating of the budget for the KI research would be a good beginning in view of the fact that all other countries are so much behind the United States. We are looking for the next KI breakthrough," said Lee.
The double of the financial resources could double the chances that the next major KI success would be achieved in the United States, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest positioned American Othello player. Later he was leader at Microsoft Research and President of the Google Delegation in China.
Lee appreciated previous technology competitions from the US government, such as the robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked for the date of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionary.
According to words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain State subsidies.
"Not China takes away the academic forces, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up coryphes of universities to work on KI.
According to reading, a change in the US immigration policy could also be favourable for the efforts made by the US.
“I think that in the field of the KI promovated persons should be automatically offered Greencards," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Read Words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances persons in academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations forgive money to US researchers, but the quality of the academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Defence Ministry founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, to which partners from industry and science should be involved. In addition, the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of 2 billion US dollars in the ‘AI Next’ initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million US dollars annually in the KI research.
In the meantime, in US situations relating to the education of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, nothing has been done for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on a change in the country name
The population of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia. This measure would attach a decade of ancient dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's applications for entry into the European Union and the NATO.
Greece, which has a Province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim is raised to the Greek territory. Hence, Greece has introduced a veto against the inclusion of Macedonia into the NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum. A Boycot campaign doubts that the electoral participation reaches the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting list was: "Are you for a membership in the NATO and the EU through the adoption of the Agreement with Greece?"
Understanders of the change in name, among which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the Joegoslavia's collapse, was worth the entry into organisations such as the EU and the NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the screen of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they would follow the result to make it crucial.
The amendment would require a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State election Commission said there were no reports on irregularities by 13.00 a.m.
However, the participation of elections was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, held on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, their vote in the referendum on the change of the country name, which Macedonia would open the way to accession to the NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage before the Parliament in Skopje, and put chairs before tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for the NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back entrance," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO membership will lead to urgent investments needed for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will be for it, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
According to his words, a "yes" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the electorates would participate in the referendum. This number is under the necessary election participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote with 'yes'.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral participation must be at 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious struggle for the politics of the prowest government since its takeover in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manövrated through the whole Brighton defense to reach the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cross the Brighton defense at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hits look ridiculous in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received a passport in the middle field.
He rushed between three Brighton defence players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then looked around four green tricots.
He played around a defense and then overhole several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's penalty room.
Then he shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penal room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overwhelmed with his right shoe Brighton Torhüter Mathew Ryan and shot to the right side of the network.
“Aguero fights with problems in his feet”, said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We had talked about having to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he reached a gate at this moment."
It was Sterling, however, who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League dual.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steilpass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few moves to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues-Angreifer aimed the ball into the network shortly before he shot out.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hopfenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies game
Since the nationals were excreted from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force a further use.
The always powerful joke, however, hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the rockies that have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West for the playoffs.
The Rockies achieved at least one wildcard on Friday evening with a 5:2-victory over the nationals, but still want to secure their first division title.
"Even though we don't play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere of the audiences here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The nationals have not announced a start player for Sunday yet, but are inclined to make jokes throw in such a situation, according to reports.
Scherzer, for which this would be the 34th use as a start player, practiced on Thursday in the Bullpen and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington legal hand has this season with a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 Strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds customers in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in relation to the Board Kavanaugh selected by the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the intermediate elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our life.
This is one of the big, large – I don't go to it, but in reality, I'm engaged in fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happens right now.
And they are determined to take over the power with all means, you see the commonness, the abhorrence.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to ride over to get the power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, see their mission to "compete and block."
"And you see this in the last four days," he said and called the Democrats "angry and mad and dishonest and dishonest".
He named the highest democrat in the Senate's Jurisdiction Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered the audience's loud bow calls.
“Remember your answer?
Did you leave the document outside?
Oh, uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer applies to all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted for cheating me, this came a little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who are told that they are not welcome – only because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had raised herself powerfully against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the request for taxation that I represented a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy with former top politicians did not agree.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "the meetings should all involve and be productive".
Mostly, in my eight years as a local Labour Member, the Friday evening meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings are not marked by this tone today, and the promised 'friendlyer, more careful' policy has been forgotten for a long time when it has ever started.
It is increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion will be assessed afterwards whether they are accepted by the Peace of the Parties.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views were now expecting me to take a turning-up and take positions that I wouldn't have agreed with, whether the national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I'm saying – there's a sjimptirade in the social media that calls for my choice, appeals to the political centre and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience I'm not standing there alone.
Actually, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of the colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist discomfort every day and never give little attention to them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuses have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn asked last week the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer let all the opinions apply, and with every suspicion proposal and any change in the electoral rules, the party becomes closer.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to put my head in and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have "no problems".
But I didn't go into politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, caused by the negligence of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom in the general school literally fell apart, the Labour Party joined, I struggled for better public services for those who need them most urgently – as a municipal board as well as as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a hole of my political views, even in the last choice.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear on my political positions and on areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
In view of the fact that the country is going to rush to a Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am not sending this one message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, regardless of whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many voting threats or political thoughts will not prevent me from acting in my opinion the best interest of all of you.

Ayr against Melrose 38:17: Unmoorded Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result something, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this very entertaining game of the day in the Tent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten crews unattached at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home crew was due to its superior defense as well as to their better chance recycling, and coach Peter Murchie had all reason to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in our games until now, and we are still unsuccessful, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have reused their chances better than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, Melrose was able to speak the numbers because of a yellow map for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot started an unincreased attempt.
Climo built the leadership of Ayr with a criminal tribunal before he reached a hit directly in the mid-term and then achieved an increased attempt in alone, so it stood for Ayr at the break of 17:5.
Melrose, however, started the second half time well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Following a longer interruption due to a severe injury by Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field. After the continuation, Ayr built his proximity by an attempt made by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as a captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again Melrose let the extra man pay by a unincreased attempt from Bruce Colvine at the end of a phase of enormous pressure.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained from the criminal gases from a touchdown behind the front Ayr package.
Climo increased as almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's box kick was captured and flamingo player Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth attempt of the home team.
“Still Game” star seems ready for new career in the gastronomy
“Still Game” Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change in the host business after showing that he was called the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC broadcast, whose turnbooks he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-year Comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next nineth pillar will be the last of the consignment, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in getting into Glasgow's “florating restaurant shop”.
“The Sea belongs to us” means the bolivia included by the country hopes that a court opens him the way to the Pacific
Seafarers patrol before the marine headquarters decorated with Tauwerk in La Paz.
Public buildings have a more blue flag.
Flower bases from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon are the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout the country-included Bolivia, the memory of the coastal section of Chile lost in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still as vivid as the desire to return across the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as for decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the International Court of Justice which will be held on 1 October after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has the swing, a spirit of unity and permission and expects the result of a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will persecute the IGH's judgment on large-screen screens in the hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea after decades of sporadic discussions.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who will be in the future of a controversial struggle for his re-elective election, there is also a lot in the judgment on Monday.
"We are just standing before returning to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court decides in favour of Bolivia, and believe that there would be little change thereby.
The United Nations Organ with seat in the Netherlands is not empowered to speak to the Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
That the IGH's judgment was before six months after the final pledge, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, suggests that the case was "non-complicated".
A far away from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also mean a backfall.
"The current Bolivian government has broken down the question of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' warrior rhetorics chucked any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will sometime continue their conversations, but after these events this becomes extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in Den Haag, rejected the view that the decision of the Court was unusually prompted.
On Monday, Bolivia has “a extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to“end the 139 years of disputes for mutual advantage”, he said.
Calzadilla also argued that Morales – still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America – uses the theme of the sea as a political crown.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is a chance to recognize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never take up its nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made at a summit between the heads of the rivals in Singapore.
His comments come at a time when the US Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, appears to be shortly before the launching of the fixed nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit with the North Korean Head of State, Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and the US resistance to a declaration to end the Korean war would ever force the north into the knee as "the brain spinst".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the explanation without first taking significant disarmament steps.
Kim and President Donald Trump both want a second summit.
There is, however, widespread skepsis that Pyongang considers it seriously with the absence of a arsenal, where the country is likely to see the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjonghang for the next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Mode views in Paris show the latest collections for huge head covers that will be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely protect the sun, you no longer have to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy excessive head covers for their summer collection in 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Extremely unpractical hats have overflowed Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their exciting creatures over the run.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige-coloured hat with a feder-like wide edge that just pushed the heads of the models.
As other superdimensional accessories, water melons occupied with jewels were shown, a magic hat and even an ananas, but they are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were equipped with close lips and had more similarity to Hannibal Lecter than with Haute Couture.
One creation was similar to a diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glass, while another looked like a melted escort.
And if you want to put another huge fashion station, you're lucky.
Mode observers predict that the huge head covers could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional hats follow directly on “La Bomba”, the 60-centimeter-wide strohhut, all wearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very unpractical hat, which hit large waves into social media, sent another large creation over the runway: a beach bag of stroh, which was almost as large as a bathing suit that holds the bag.
The bastach in red orange with bast francs and a white leather pink was the prominent piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection “La Riviera” at the Paris fashion week.
The prominent Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I assume that big hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has so much excited that the demand for superdimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Languages for World Citizens Indispensable
Schotland's independent schools continue to be academic excellence. This has continued in 2018 with further outstanding test results and is only supported by individual and common successes in sports, arts, music and other Community businesses.
With more than 30 000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are pursuing to care for their students and their parents at the highest level.
Independent schools are pursuing the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can draw up a customized learning plan and actually implement it, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current test results of this year are that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students learning foreign languages reached Note A in the higher tests.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved Note A in the higher trials, while 72 percent of the students learned German, 69 percent of the students learning French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also reached Note A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered as electoral vacations as well as STEM Factors (Natural Sciences, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in the teaching plans of independent schools and in other places.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons why employers called the problems of occupation of open jobs were related to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language knowledge will be increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
Since more and more open posts require languages, these knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Independently, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage by such a lifelong ability in the future.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual individuals will automatically provide ahead of candidates.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak the foreign language well enough to entertain, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason it is important for the children of today that we are now investing in language education.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have better opportunities to find a sensible job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whereever your child's interests are, in independent schools, a number of languages with appropriate specialized teachers will always be elected.
Scottish independent schools are engaged in creating a learning environment that prepares the children and provides them with the necessary skills for their success, as the future looks.
At this time in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so this must reflect in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as ‘international communication capacity’.
Independent schools in Scotland will continue to offer young people this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bee le faire.

LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see how LeBron James arrives for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting will soon end.
Lakers Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the presaison against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
The number of minutes he will play, however, is not fixed yet.
“It will be more than one and less than 48”” said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twisted that James is likely to play just a few minutes.
In the beginning of this week James was asked for training for his plans for the six games of the Lakers' full seasonal game.
“I don’t need pre-saison games in this phase of my career to prepare me,” he said.
Time for trumps advertising in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a number of elections.
This is the first one of Trumps five planned for the next week, including well-minded places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the floating vote on the confirmation of his choice for the vacation at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming semi-term elections in November, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control over the Congress.
When is Trumps' advertising in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trumps kundgebung in Wheeling, West Virginia, is planned for today, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19:00 (eastern time).
You can track Trumps customership in West Virginia below as livestream at YouTube online.
Trump is likely to respond to the hearings of the Board Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court on the charges of sexual error that have been carried out this week in an excited atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains up to one week in the sweep while the FBI is carrying out investigations.
However, the main objective of this series of advertising is to support Republicans who have to make a difficult choice in November.
Therefore, President Trump's electoral battle team against Reuters stated that these five customers next week serve to mobilise “volunteers and adherents, while the Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the Representative House”.
"The control of the Congress is as important for its plans that the President will travel to as many states as possible, while the operating election season is near," said a trump-walk speaker who didn't want to call his name to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, it is possible to participate in the advertising planned for this evening in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling “Ohio and Pennsylvania and report media from Pittsburgh”.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the republikan Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, in surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the President must come to try to give him in the surveys," said Simon Haeder, policeologist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the United States shows fighting willingness to maintain the hope for individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four parties may have been exactly what this clearer needed cup on Saturday afternoon.
The vibrant pendle of the moment is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one that the players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So where is the moment of their opinion now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now it's four, therefore I think this means a little moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when leaving the place.
Europe, of course, is in the advantage of four points, while twelve others follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can present three of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from departure to green and goes forward with a good example.
The goodural enthusiasm shouts became louder in his next round when he lowered an important punk to decide the fourth match with four points for himself after he and Thomas had left back after two holes with two points.
His Putt, who decided the match for her on the 15th hole, triggered a similar cry, which makes it clear that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really have to knee in and care for my own game," said Spieth.
That's all that remains for each player.
18 holes to put a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas, and therefore undoubtedly wrote the history of Ryder Cup.
Europe's inequal, but sympathic duo is at four of four points and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” was not the only couple who had not hit a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning Bogeys.
This series and the apparently between them and the extinct amount of flowing energy supports them to be the players who are to beat it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who conquered a possible European victory when the sun declined over Le Golf National.
Preferred both at the same time on different holes.
However, speaking of European fame would be early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-held of the morning, who played along with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spanish and Sweden into a climb that they couldn't overcome nearby.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the climb.
The four and four pairs are so fascinating from nearby, because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give or not, and the way a strategy can change quickly.
The Europeans have played better as a team until now and are clearly in the leadership of the last day. However, this four round has also shown that the team of the United States is ready to fight, which some, especially in the United States, had doubted.
Europe runs on the last day of Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is at the front of the fours and four parties from Saturday to the United States with 10:6 and goes with a solid forward in the last day of Ryder Cup.
The genius-playing Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went forward with two victories on the tiger Woods that struggled with difficulties and could thus book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team referred to by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to return the lost trophy in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the fours in the morning against the American crew who played wrongly and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the United States made more resistance and won two matches, but could not pick up the remainder.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in a row as the first European newling, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend, only won four points after the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After hitting Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized outstandingly and struck the enthusiastic woods and the American Neuling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more prominent 5&4.
Woods, who had slept through two matches on Saturday, suddenly got his brilliance lighted up, but now 19 of his 29 matches lost in fours and four parties and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning during the four, returned and played as a partner of Henrik Stenson the four parties. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris did not run everything according to their ideas.
The three-fold Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the messenger for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a thick 2/1 victory in the fours over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3, after they lost the first two holes.
In the history of Ryder Cup, it has only occurred twice that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a remnant of four points. However, as a title holder, a disadvantage is enough for Furyk's crew to keep the trophy.
After just two days on the second place, it does not look like they could start a counter attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral degradation without confidence
On Saturday before the United Nations, North Korean Foreign Minister said that continued sanctions deepened their distrust to the United States and would not, in such circumstances, give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that in the last year, North Korea has taken essential measures of good will. For example, it has stopped nuclear and rocket tests, degraded the nuclear test area and committed itself to not growing nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not one-sided first."
While Ri replied to Nordkorea's complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach to denuclearing which would reward North Korea for successive steps, his statement seemed significant when she did not reject one-sided denuclearisation from before, as it had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official president of the US and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this, Kim was assured to work on the "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is pursuing an official end of the Korean war conducted from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington is opposed to demands for enlightening the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is on "first denuclearation" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal by compulsory force, and is even against the "declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into the knees is a brain spin of the people who don't know anything about us.
The problem is, however, that the penalties continue to deepen our distrust."
Ri did not accept plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Head of State had highlighted with the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If South Korea instead of the United States had been the other party in the denuclearing question, it would not have been this stop when the Korean peninsula was denuclearized."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris speech differed enormously from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it is inevitable to aim with North Korea's rockets on the United States' Festival, after "the evil president" Trump Kim had called "Raketenmann" on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened with the “full destruction” of North Korea, overwhelmed Kim with praise for his courage in terms of defence steps. However, he said that there was still much work to do and the penalties would have to remain in force until the detucearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he has no timeframe for it: "If it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council must reward Pjongjang for the steps taken.
However, on Thursday, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must in any case be continued energyfully until we have achieved the complete, final and verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to remove Pjöngang's programmes for nuclear weapons and ballistic rockets financially.
Pompeo met with Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he said when leaving Pjonghang, that progress had been made only for hours later to be accused of North Korea of having made “passion-like claims”.
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with Moon, a rocket base and an atomic complex when the United States took "compliant measures".
He said that Kim told him that the endeavors to "compliant measures" are security guarantees given to the Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep this year during basic study. This is a measure against the widespread macho culture to keep themselves alert with caffeine and learn throughout the night.
A scientist has found that students at the world leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to watching themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to call the course into life after holding a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I know about this only now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. This surprised me." he said to The Telegraph.
The course that took place this year first explained to the student how the foundations of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve the general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Director of Health Services at University, said that the university decided to introduce the course after she found that students were under severe sleep retirement during the week.
The single-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the students see the picture of a room in a home and click on coffee bags, curtains, training shoes and books. They get information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of sleep shortages on the sports performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
Afterwards, they are encouraged to think about their daily routines using a map of the university area with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a ‘night layer’ is still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the constantly growing pressure on the students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
He said that there was sufficiently good sleep to ensure that the “home weapon” of all students should be against stress, fatigue and anxiety. In addition, a weight increase was avoided as sleep withdrawal puts the brain into hunger mode, so that they were constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had been in Harvard last year in his first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to press on a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all post-graduate students will be invited to complete a similar study programme before they start their study at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, students should set awake for the sleeping and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that come from electronic screens and LED lights and can bring the zircadian rhythm out of the tact. This leads to problems with sleeping.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor conquered Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another outward game than the hit of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrard's unanimous team meant a 0:1-deposit at Livingston.
The Ibrox manship wanted to book its first outward victory since the 4:1-Triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added Gerrard the first second victory in 18 games as manager, so that his crew is behind eight points behind the distant hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before the half, and the inspired poor Rangers seemed not to have a chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is only behind Hibernian at the Tordifferenz.
The Rangers are also threatening further trouble after the ruler Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object that appeared to be thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard took eight changes to the team that Ayr excreted and reached the half-final of Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, the same eleven Livingston players who took a point to the heart in the last week, would have to be enthusiastic about how his well trained team held their opponents under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingston reached more if they had the ball.
You should have reached a gate after just two minutes when Mengas first release led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate. However, the middle field player missed his chance and shot at the end.
Then a long release of Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only prey on the back.
The Rangers took over the control, but their game was more hopeful in the last third than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of time, he should have received a criminal offence due to a collision between him and Steven Lawless, but arbitrary judge Steven Thomson did not apply the complaints of the Colombian.
In the first half, the Rangers came only two towers, but the former Ibrox Torhüter Liam Kelly had hardly trouble with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a tame shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's matches in the 34th minute may not match the game history, it is not denied that they deserved him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted half-time and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately showed effect when the wings player morelos positioned, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game that lies with them, where Lithgow and Halkett got a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and rejected Jacob's before Lithgow had a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also demanded a penalty after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Victor
And now one page from our “Sunday Morning” Almanach: On 30 September 1882, today’s 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for the detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as a winger.
Since then, the winner became the standard element of science became a standard element of popculture, for example in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado” with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the whole world is this?"
Rogers: “This is a victory counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "In fact, I hear a kid!"
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention that wears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ disturbed cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and destroy disturbed cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to identify disturbed cells in the treatment process.
The method is used to remove immune cells that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a lot of cancer types of common protein and then will be injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify disturbed cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method contains immune cells that are modified in the laboratory so that they can see the many cancer types of common protein HER2. Then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of various types of cancer", including breast-, egg-stock, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method where patients are taken from immune cells and learned to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a type of leukaemia.

Canye West was built out at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had praised and said he wanted to join a presidential candidate in 2020.
After having sung his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make-America-Great-Again cap, he continued with a shimp canonade against the Democrats and once again emphasized his support for trump.
“I am so often asked by the whites, ‘How can you like trump? He is racist.’
So, if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the shipment with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywoodstar made fun about Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Jurisdiction Committee on the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's Shimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by comic Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the publication on West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his head coverage.
“They have sharked me behind the stage.
They said, ‘Don't go out with the cap’.
You've kicked me!
And then they say I'm in a deceased area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the deceased area?" He said that he will "to dress my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go forward with the world?
Try it with love."
His comments revealed at least twice the audience's bow calls, and SNL-contributors were embarrassed, reported Variety. One person said to the magazine: “It was dead still in the studio.”
West had been committed late as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a lecture of the title “I Love it”, where he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the Conservative Group TPUSA. She argued: “On one of the most courageous spirits: DANKE, DU HAVE THAT THE MASSE HAVE DIGNED.”
The Talkshow engineer Karen Hunter, however, twisted that West is just he himself and that is absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes an injurious ideology own to my community and gives from himself (in order to buy his music or clothes or to support his ‘kunst’).
He's free.
The same applies to us." added she.
Before the shipment, the rapper had announced at Twitter that he had changed his name and was now “The being formally known as Kanye West” (the officially known being Canye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the deceased musical legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to “The Artist Formerly Know As Prince” (the former artist known as Prince).

“Game of Thrones” Star Kit Harington attacks toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword swinging Jon Snow in HBOs of violence-powered medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actress has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such roles on the screen would have resulted in that boys often have the feeling to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said that he believes something was wrong and asked how to solve the problem of the toxic male in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who was also a member of "Game of Thrones", also 31, admitted that the solution of the problem was "very important".
"I personally think the question is very important at this time, what happened wrong with maleness," he said.
"What have we taught growing men about the problem we are watching now?"
Harington believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic maskulinity due to the very mathematical characters.
He continued: “What is inborn, and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the street that gives boys the feeling to have to embrace this particular side of a man?
I think that is really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
For the young men have clearly failed."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series, he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones" after the next summer. He has "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November on, Harington is seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's “True West”, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actress recently told him that the best thing for him was to “Game of Thrones” that he had met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife at this mission, so I received my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played the fantasy series Ygritte, the beloved of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14°% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820 000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40.000 new cases were reported.
Unlike the past, the transfer took place in most of the new cases by sex.
HIV has hitherto spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
The number of people infected with HIV in this way, but had been almost reduced to zero, reported Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in the annual comparison, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100 000 in China.
HIV transmission by sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT-Community members is to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of the men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transfers are due to insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees let the data of the GOP-senators pass through, criticises "hazardous lies" and "combination theories"
Maxine Waters, Member of the U.S. Representative House, argued on Saturday that a member of their staff published the personal information from three Republican American senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Members.
The Los Angeles Democracy believed that the claims of "ultra-righted" experts and websites would be spread.
“Lucks, lies and more disgusting lies”, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday online. They were published during the hearing of a Senate Committee on the charges against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual infringements by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three Senators had consulted Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of contributions was assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
“This unjustified accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for transmitting this information.
This unjustified accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ explanation quickly triggered criticism online, including those of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
“This dementi is angry,” said Fleischer.
“This makes it clear that she does not have the right temperament to be a congress member.
People who are accused of something they have not done may not be angry.
You can't be proud.
You may not question the applicant's motives.
You must be quiet and left."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ response to the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of having done too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who joined the semi-time elections to trigger waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if this is true,” he twittered.
Waters said in her statement that their office informed the competent authorities and criminal persecution authorities about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the actors are revealed,” she continued, “and that they will be accounted for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all members of my staff.”
Critics for “Johnny English – You live only three times” – weak spionage parodie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to search for Brexit references in every British colored film. This seems to be true for this releasing of the Actioncomödie-Parodye-Franchise “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spion, which devoured it” and reared with “Johnny English – Now right” in 2011.
Will an ironic self-parodie about the subject, as obviously we are, becoming a new export opportunities for the nation?
In any case, the license of the gloomy, grigmass cutting and incompetent Johnny English has been extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinema seekers in the non-English language space.
Of course, he is again the tricky secret agent who considers himself bizarrely cool and world-manly, while in fact he has contributed from something Clouseau, a prize Mr. Bean and a cliff of this guy, which consists of a single note to the title melody of "The Hour of the Victor" at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos of travellers and international secret agents who played the Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television spots.
The last adventure by Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor leaves shortly boiled to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comics occurs, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely overflowing, especially because the "serious" series of films such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" in the meantime, of course, offer comedian elements.
The humor seems to be more focused on children than on adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy misbehavior is not as impressive and focused as Atkinson's Stummfilmgat in the role of the Bean.
The ever-current premise is now that Great Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super secret British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents in use, a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last strohhalm for the Prime Minister, a blowed and stressed figure that is already before the complete collapse due to its political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script does not give much to work with which she can.
Their secret service adviser informs them that all active spiones have been disturbed and therefore they have to get someone out of retirement.
This also includes the tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher at a senior establishment, but there is inappropriate education in working as a subcover agent. There are some gags, because English offers a spionage academy that is reminded of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to a emergency meeting to Whitehall and reunited with his formerly severely tested Kumpan Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-Boot Commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terrible wrong in the secret service of your Majesty, are again in action. They meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Fem Fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerous in the ban of a charismatic technician, the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain.
English and Bough start their Odyssee of the bigsque spits: As a cellar clothes they put a delicious French restaurant in Brand, they care for chaos when they smuggle on board Voltas luxuryacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house with a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, although all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny it is, the topic is already extensively handled in child television.
Very moderate.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself, "Can't the British film industry Rowan Atkinson give a role that will really justify his talent?"
Labour argues to work on a plan for the British to work four days a week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is intended to consider a radical plan that provides that the British are working four days a week but paid for five days.
The party would like to report that business leaders would transmit the savings obtained by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the employees.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was supported by the trade union (Trades Union Congress) as an opportunity for workers to benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
A high - level source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a directive test is expected to be announced.
"A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day week of work is an effort that is consistent with the party's approach to the recovery of economic balance to the benefit of workers and the general industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party.
A speaker of the Labour Party said: "In a 4-day week it is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancell John McDonnell concreted his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy last week at the Labour Conference.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power of "anonymous directors" and "profit makers" in public supply companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retained their entire share, as a Labour government could take a "deduction" because of a suspected misconduct.
He also confirmed the appropriate plans to occupy employees in the boards of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private companies' own funds to employees cashing annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say in the news magazine “60 minutes” whether the FBI's investigation in the case of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI investigation to the claims against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has suspended a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court of Justice for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority could affect Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could bring a day, which could eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I told the negotiation that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was expressed, and asked if he did.
He was determined, definite and inconscious."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be measured in stone.
"My opinion is determined on Brett Kavanaugh, and there would have to be a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Board has struggled this vehement," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called could not confirm it."
It's now 36 years.
And I can't find any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was contributed to reducing poverty in the context of this festival?
On this Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York to fight an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an impressive mission – the poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival that takes place this year for the seventh time, not only to experience the appearances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. In the framework of this project, an international stakeholder group is trying to fight poverty by increasingly motivating people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket) you need to complete a number of tasks, including actions such as voluntary work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (per e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty.
How successful is the project if you consider that Global Citizens remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of a cool free concert a useful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think it is to change something by signing an online petition or sending a Tweet?
Global citizens informed that since 2011 the project has been able to identify more than 19 million actions from its supporters and to achieve various objectives.
These actions are intended to have contributed to encouraging leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars were already paid out or purchased by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the secured funds have been directly affected to nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers in the United Kingdom, who have committed themselves to support children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to fight underernähring in the country after they have received more than 4.700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutration a footnote in history”, the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, informed the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also informed that after more than 5,000 actions called on Britain to improve the nutrition situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project The Power of Nutrition, which is intended to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutrition interventions.
As an answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question why global citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they replied: “There will be a long and tough way with heights and depths.
But like the great movements of civil rights and anti-apartness before us, we will be successful, as we are together stronger and more influenced.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe belongs to the artists who appear at this year's event in New York. With them Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also moderns.
The United States could use the marine for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Ministry of Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can go back to the marine if necessary so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, the U.S. Minister Ryan Zinke informed.
Zinke claimed that Russia's use in Syria is a predecessor of exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently working on the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in energy, just as in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official there are means and ways to deal with this.
“The United States can, together with the Marine, ensure that the seaways remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he informed.
Zinke turned to the participants of the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which is understood as "the voice of the electricity consumer" in the United States.
He made a comparison between Washington’s approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he called Russia "One Trick Pony" with a economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations were made when the government under Trump was in expanding the export of liquid gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Pipeline Project Nord Stream 2, with the Trump Berlin becomes a "catched" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exercising pressure and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German industry's Federal Association (BDI), called on the United States to eliminate the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a major problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," says the board of BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Kanzler Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "examine a presidency candidate in 2020," says the Senator for Massachusetts
On Saturday, the Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced that she would “examine” a presidential candidate after the intermediate elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she considers a candidature.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our destroyed government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “examine” a presidency candidate after 6 November.
During the meeting, Warren said that President Trump leads this country in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has not taken a leaf in her criticism to Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a Tweet on Friday, she announced that a FBI investigation is obviously necessary before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's electorates do not believe that it should be submitted for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not be able.
32 percent of the voters supported such a candidateship.
The survey showed more support for a candidateship of the former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent favouring a potential candidate, and 48 percent who are against it.
The former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, bids announced that he would decide officially until January.
Sarah Palin speaks on the Donald Trump-Ralley to post-traumatic load disturbance, under the Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening.
“What my son endures, what he endures when he comes back, all that can reflect other families who feel the effects of the PTBS and part of the wounds with which our soldiers return,” she informed the audience at a Ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as “elephant in the room” and said about her son and other war veterans that they would come back changely, that they would come back more broken, that they would come back and wonder if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military gave to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence on a woman, says Dan Bennett, a speaker of the police authority of Wasilla.
18 State and D.C. support a legal action on new asylum policy
18 States and the district of Columbia support a legal aid for new US politics that refuse victims of band activity or asylum violence.
Representatives of the 18 state states and the district reached an expert declaration on Friday in Washington to support a asylum candidate questioning policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace-gen-session complaint submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the Federal Policy was not announced.
She announced that her partner “and his violent bandage sons” abused them, but the US officials rejected their asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people make an application for asylum in the United States as nations who have to fight with major problems with criminal bands and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy lifted a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014 which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum on the escape of domestic violence.
The General Federal Attorney of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “the decades of legislation at state, federal and international level” ignored.
"The Bundesgesetz stipulates that all asylum applications are assessed based on the relevant facts and circumstances of the application, and that court is in breach of this principle," was stated in the Declaration by the Court of Justice.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policies that immigrants refuse to access to the country have unfavourable effects on the US economy, as immigrants could be more active as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workers.
In June, the General Federal Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges would no longer grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and the violence of criminal bands.
"Asyl exists for those who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or for fears due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said Sessions in its announcement of policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to eliminate all the problems, even all serious problems that people have to fight with every day worldwide, by granting asylum.
Despaired rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of death victims is doubled in the race with time
For survivors, the situation became worse.
“It’s all very excited,” says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma and calms her little fevering son in a rescue center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute a new hospital car comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is short."
Inhabitants returned to their destroyed houses to gather their nearest possession and good and to save everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals who were damaged by the earthquake with the strength 7.5 were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured ones, including Dwi Haris, who crocheted and broken shoulder, remained outside the military hospital of Palu, where patients in the outer area were treated because of the persistent strong descendants.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the vicious earthquake shook the hotel room in the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“All went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the entering walls," he reported the Associated Press, and added that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s help calls, but then there was peace.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. Messengers complain about the Tyrannei with “propaganda ads”
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had made a four-sided advertisement in an American daily newspaper in which the mutual advantages of trade between the USA and China were announced, the U.S. Messengers in China accused the national capital of Peking to use the American press for propaganda purposes.
The United States Donald Trump was referring to the paid appendix of China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa after accusing China to mix into the US Congress elections on November 6, a charge against China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to mix into the US elections correspond to the communication of U.S. officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered by Washington to exercise pressure on China.
While it is usual that foreign governments switch advertising for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an outstanding trade war, with duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese countervailing duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Messengers in China and former long-term governor of Iowa, who exports agricultural products to China to a large extent, informed that Beijing workers, holders of agricultural holdings and companies have damaged.
China, according to Branstad in a position in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles this tyrannei by turning propaganda ads in its own free press in the USA.
“With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the best practice of the free expression and the independent press in America by switching advertising paid in the Des Moines register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find the newspaper skios here in Beijing only in a limited number of contradictions and do not really reflect the different opinions that the Chinese might have about the disturbing economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firm in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer for publication of his article, but he did not call the name of the newspaper.
Republicans proclaim electorates from the intermediate elections with the Debakel around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several accusations for sexual violence, observers have warned against a counterreaction during the coming intermediate elections, which might be particularly due to women.
The vote in this context was extremely excited, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they continue with a vote.
Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of the Syracuse University The Hill, announced for a article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute prosecution was sufficient for an FBI investigation to address angry voters.
“Don’t forget what was yesterday, she don’t forget tomorrow and not in November”, said Karine Jean-Pierre on Friday, first consultant and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group, according to the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "November is coming", when the Republicans who control the Jurisdiction Committee decided to hold on the nomination of Kavanaughs and reported that, despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, told Stu Rothenberg, an unpartial political observer of the news page.
“Men say it's already high, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially for choosers in the front and for younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the President, often do not choose."
Even before the public statement of Ford, in which their accusations of sexual attack against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counterreaction could be the result if the Republicans advanced the confirmation.
“This situation is a violent interference for the GOP”, said NBC News at the beginning of the last week, Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee.
"It is not only about the body's vote, the final vote or the verification of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities United States, a group supporting the election of Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to disagree with whom they should believe because of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly greater share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitely or probably convinced of the statement of Ford, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably gave Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38% indicated that they believed that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying to his statement, while 30% indicated the same about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations submitted by Ford and at least one other applicant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford, last week before the Senate's Jurisprudence Committee, made an odd statement that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17 years.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed her to his genitals when they were at a party during their course in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently bringing a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made the best that the intention behind inruption was the “Weltherrschaft”.
“We need to become active now”, he said about startup.
"It is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or an POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and business area.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content are available in a browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that the user can decide alone who can access what data.
The company refers to this concept as personal reinforcement and development of data.
According to John Bruce's CEO, the idea behind inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and the corresponding capabilities so that Solid is available for all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up for the work on this project, as well as a Community voluntary programmer. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers can create their own decentralized apps worldwide with the tools available on the inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change should be made, where their entire business models will be completely transformed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote, in a contribution to the medium published on Saturday, that the task is to provide commercial energy production and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was significantly involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the start of interruption, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, member of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergy of the Church of England, who was elected as a fighter with the Viktoria cross during the first world war, was honored 100 years later in his home town.
Colonel Lieutenant and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his use when attacking Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharp protector and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren revealed on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, a memorial stone.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed just 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Lieutenant Vann led his Bataillon on 29 September 1918 through the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through dense fog and under a strong gun of field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he went to the fireline and led the line forward with the “greatest courage” before he had a field gun in front of himself and switched out three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot on October 4, 1918 by a German sharp protector; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were something he could never be justified, and at the same time something that makes a humble one.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a crown after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann claimed that he felt very honorable to be able to participate in the parade and added that the braveness of a real hero will be visible mainly by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed alert all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've stayed alert all night to see an exciting bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The invoice of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was delivered live all night in the United Kingdom to channel 5.
At 6 o'clock then, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their battle, the viewers in the United Kingdom weren't surprised to see Peppa Pig suddenly.
Some remained without touch after they stayed alert until the early morning hours to see the battle specially.
A fan described the switch to the trick film figure on Twitter as a somewhat bad joke.
"On the basis of a regulation by the government, these content are classified as not youth-free, so that at 6 p.m. had to be changed to a child mission," said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice President in the field of marketing and communication at Bellator when he was consulted on the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The company board at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will be editing the schedule to take into account viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think the problem could be solved in the game of repetition," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday with the spectators in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday Local Time there.
But we're staying.
There was a lot of communication during the change. It went pretty well and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical disturbance.
What wasn't the case, it was a problem from the government.
I promise that this won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, like normally, and we've tried to offer the fan's best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “low” in the topic of sexuality
Tom Daley, who was a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling of being undergoing all others because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old thought that he had only realized at the further school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he has spoken on the subject of sulphur rights to encourage others.
He also thought that since he became father, the victory in the Olympic Games is no longer so important for him.
The actual moder of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses disease condition for a few months.
In the first consignment of Laverne, he said that earlier, compared with others, he viewed himself as lesswert, since love for boys and girls was completely unacceptable.
He said: “To this day, feeling is to be submissive and different from the others, reason for my power and strength and finally for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-fold Bronze Medal winner at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT-activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth Games of this year in Australia to advance the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke on this subject because he is happy to live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to courage others.
The three-fold world champion in love with the U.S. film maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. Knowledge to get in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winners, but he shared that the age difference had never been a topic.
He believes that if you had to endure so much as a child and a youth – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time when he was 14 years old and his father died in cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the pair has a son who has the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his whole view has changed since then.
Last year, he had all turned around gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia Gold Medals.
His son Robbie is now his main win.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the nearing death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be in front of it.
“I couldn’t tell him that he would no longer be there,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only afterwards I finally realized that he was not inviable,” he continued.
In the following year, Daley won the bronze medal in the Olympic Games 2012.
“I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in Olympic games before the local audience – that was the crazy thing," he said.
His first song selection – stole by Heather Small – was also influenced. He heard the song in front of the Olympic Games and still cared for granules.

Mickelson, currently not in form, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to try very much so that it doesn't become a debakel.
Mickelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the replacement bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the centre of the event, the five-fold Major winner spent his day fireing and working on his game, in the hope of fixing the problems that burden him.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National Golf Square, where defective balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself would not be discouraging enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined with Tommy Fleetwood, Newling at these tournaments, in the ninth game on Sunday to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points remain a hot start at the 12 single games, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
“He was perfect about his role in clarifying today, gave me a knock on my back and put his arm around me and said that he was ready for tomorrow,” said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He belongs to the world-known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I wouldn't have thought he'd be in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went and that's what we've expected.
He wants to be there like anybody else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games exhibited on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a clearer Cup runway that never fully matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, had 20 defeat and reached seven half times, although Furyk announced that his presence has already enriched the team alone.
"He is funny and sarkastic, original and likes to make a few spices, and he is a great man who is popular in the entire team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to meet him this week. It was fun to watch them.
He is a really interesting man who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be over with the spring soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advance, which leads to the last single games in Ryder Cup, can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
In 1997, the Dane debuted in Valderrama, where a team chaired by Seven Ballesteros had a front of five points against the Americans, but only almost crossed the target line and led with the smallest possible spring and won a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a great spring in Valderrama, we had a great spring in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only little," said Bjørn (on the photo), after he had seen the victory of the class of 2018 5–3 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow, it's going to be right.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole is over only when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I've always said that I've focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what's against us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Bjorn continued: “I would never crash.
Tomorrow's going to be another caliber.
Tomorrow, the individual benefits are at the forefront, and that is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're out alone, you'll be tested as a golfer up to the limits of your skills.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counter to Jim Furyk will be careful that his players separately cut off better than in the team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that great turning on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winner's side before standing on the side of the losers after Europe 'Wonders of Medinah'.
"I remember every fucking word," he answered the question like Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
If the momentum strikes in a direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know we're trying to sweep tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of bringing to the counter, he has to enter the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the rank list.
“I have decided for the boys in this order, because I think it covers everything,” said Bjorn about his choice for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The latest fregates of the German Marine should have been served in 2014 to replace warships coming into the years from the time of the Cold War. However, according to local media, it will only be delivered early next year due to defective systems and rapidly growing costs.
The entry into service of the ‘Rhineland-Pfalz’, the leadership of the brand new fregates of the ‘Baden-Württemberg’ class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time called for a military speaker.
The ship should have been served in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the Marine in 2007, are to replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a powerful canon, a number of flight defence missiles and sea destination airlines as well as tarn technologies such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest fregates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the persistent delays may lead to an obsolete age of the high-modern warships which Germany is supposed to represent as sea power at the time of their entry into service, says The Time.
The fregate F125 followed by the accident last year went into the battlelines when the German Marine officially refused to take the ship down and returned it to the Bloom & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine returned a ship to the ship after its delivery.
There was little known about the reasons for return, but German media called a number of significant "software and hardware errors" which would have made the new ship unusable in a fight situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only half as many as on the older fregates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too difficult, which leads to performance infringement and prevents the marine from being able to implement remedy measures in the future.
The 7000 tons of heavy “Rhineland-Pfalz” seemed to be twice as difficult as ships with a similar class used by Germany in the second world war.
In addition to the incorrect hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, have also been a problem.
Apparently, the costs increased to stunning €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates are particularly important in view of the recent warnings that the sea force of Germany is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, defense officer of the German Federal Day, confirmed that the Marine was “outgoing the ships capable of operation”.
Bartels said that the problem grew by time, since old ships were taken out of service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the Marine.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Fledermäus
New research will be carried out in a property in the Scottish Highlands, which will show how flager mice use the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insight into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to lead to future natural protection activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will explore dwarf- and muggenfleather mice as well as the brown long ear and waterfleather mice in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed on key positions on the ground to record the activities of the bats during the entire season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies with portable detectors.
In the case of a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the flager mice calls is determined and the species are doing something.
A map and a habitat report are then drawn up in order to create a detailed picture of their landscape behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will show what areas of the habitat are most important for the Fledermaus and how these are used by any species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of the measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of wheat, and to demonstrate how to obtain forest areas for flager mice and other related species.
The fledermaus stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect sleeping places and lead to the loss of living space.
Wind wheels and lighting can also pose a risk, like flying fans and the chemical treatment of construction materials or also attacks by house cats.
Fledermice isn't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an exhausted equipment to identify insects and obstacles in their route.
The NTS responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the theme of the flager mice very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out studies, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only Fledermausreservate in the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight of Scotland’s 10 Fledermausspezies.
Good manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal living space for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great area for flager mice," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living area.
But there are many things that we have not yet known about battle mice, so we are doing these works here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what battle mice needs to feel well."
He emphasizes the importance of excludeing the presence of flager mice before maintenance in the goods, as it is possible that the unwilling destruction of a single nutrition site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eliminate the entire population on the spot.
Fledermice is protected and it is illegal to kill them, to harm them or to destroy them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to assist.
She explains: "We still need to learn much about bats and in many of our species we don't know how it is about their populations."
Ronaldo argues rape claims while his lawyers want to complain the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape claims against him as “Fake News” and said that people want to be “roamed” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to complain about the news magazine The Mirror, which published the accusations.
The storm of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He said he paid her 375,000 dollars to buy her silence for the incident, according to The Mirror on Friday.
In an instagram live video with its 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports as “Fake News” only hours after its publication.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-month winner of the balloon d’Or to the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to become famous with my name, but this is part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smiling.
Ronaldos lawyers are preparing to complain about the mirror due to the accusations they called "inadmissible reporting on suspicions in the field of privacy" according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for “injury of moral damage at a level that corresponds to the gravity of infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personality rights in recent years.”
The claimed incident was supposed to have occurred in 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they had met in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga were supposed to go to the player's room where he, according to documents submitted to the Clark County Court in Nevada, had definitely raped them.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to the knee after the claimed incident and said to her that he was “99 percent a good guy” who was the “a percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it had been agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an extra judicial agreement, as she had “angry for recompensation” and worried to be“rejected” publicly.
The 34-year-old said that they are now trying to dismiss the agreement, since it is still traumatic because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the date of the claimed event just before switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid and switching this summer into a 100 million euros heavy deal to the Italian Giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘repent forever’ the loss of the car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “repent forever” if it lost its status as a world-wide leading manufacturer of cars, says Minister for Economic Affairs, Greg Clark.
He continued to say that it is “angry” that Toyota UK of BBC told that it would interrupt production in Burnaston at Derby, should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese automotive manufacturer claimed that the impact of delays at the border at a non-deal brexit could lead to loss of jobs.
The work in Burnaston, in which Toyotas product lines are produced Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150.000 vehicles, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience in our work at an uncontrolled Brexit end of March production stops”, says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's manager in Burnaston.
Other British automotive manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised fears of a hard EU exit without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close his mini work in Oxford after the Brexit for a month.
The main concerns are, according to the car manufacturers, linked with risks within the supply chain at a hard Brexit.
Toyota's production plant is operated on a ‘Just-in-Time’ base. This means that the parts are supplied every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the United Kingdom and the EU to make the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there may be interruptions at the frontiers which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and broken-ups in the parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to carry a stock in the work of Derbyshire that is sufficient for more than one day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa Mays Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such controls at the border”.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us to enjoy not only the current success but also to take this opportunity," he explained in the BBC Radio 4 broadcast today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would be interrupted, but long-term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and eventually result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been busy in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unit's union, explained that his members are increasingly worried: “My experience is that these jobs never come back once they are gone.
One government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be re-located according to the White House's information
Donald Trump's important meeting with Vice-President Rod Rosenstein could be postponed “for another week”, while the dispute about the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, it was held out on Sunday from the White House.
Rosenstein has examined the oversight of the work of the specialist Robert Mueller, who examines Russia's electoral interferences, links between Trumps consultants and Russia, and a possible disability of justice by the President.
The question whether Trump would fire the Vice-Jurisdiction Minister and thereby threaten Mueller's independence has been subject to rumors in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of the secret recording of his conversations with Trump as well as the office of the President using the 25th Constitutional Addition.
Rosenstein declared the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his supposed withdrawal were known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, held at this time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump declared that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid that it conflicts with the hearing before the judicial committee of the US Senate, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had encountered him sexual abuse, said.
On Friday, Trump arranged a weekly FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trumps Press Speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She answered a question about a meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set. It may be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are just going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press on the running."
Some reporters would probably oppose this claim: Sanders has no longer held a press conference of the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of the press conferences does not lie on a decline to the "effect-hashing" of the TV reporters, but admitted: "I wouldn't argue that they operate effect-hashing."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President makes more questions and answers than any President before him," she said without accurate evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
There will still be press conferences, says Sanders, but it is, “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, but much better than to talk to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have done this often in recent weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions if he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignities.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the President may have shown why this is the case when he put a bizarre appearance out of the rudder before gathered reporters.
Minister for Health writes for Brexit concerns to EU employees of the Scottish NHS
The Ministry of Health is referring to people from abroad who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and to express their wish to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter from the EU less than six months before the United Kingdom exited.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself willing to bear the costs of requests for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “In the course of the summer, the departure negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected to be made.
However, the British Government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible non-deal scenario.
I know what disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Members and colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and thus benefit the patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very pleased if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected after a head injury of an emergency surgery
The linebacker of the Tennessee State of Tiger Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery on Saturday at 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ of Tennessee State.
Rod Reed, the Chief Coach of Tennessee State, explained to reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the sideline and just broke there," said Reed.
Trainer and medical staff provided Abercrombie on the side line with oxygen before he was placed on a carrier and transported for further investigations.
A speaker of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie left the OP at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details on the nature or extent of the injury” are known and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays at Tennessee State during his first season after he switched over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, thus increasing his total number in the season to 18 takles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchase in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will need to raise higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom in the future. The additional revenue will benefit homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This step is intended to end the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign on young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will cover all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects revenues of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, benefiting homeless.
This step represents an attempt to hamper Jeremy Corbyn's success in young electorates, who promises to provide more affordable living rooms and to take top-valuers into view.
The increase in the tax on stamps is raised to individuals and companies which do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenues are intended to lead to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is raised in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on secondary apartments and rentals, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected by the step of increases of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built property in London is purchased by investors who are not resident in the United Kingdom. This will drive prices up to the height and it is more difficult for first buyers to get foot in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “geist cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers mostly spending outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has expressed a reduction in stamp tax to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies to keep the real estate prices high by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end the UK 'Wohnraumschande'.
The opposition leader Corbyn announced a splendid series of proposals for living space reforms that range from a rental price commitment to the prohibition of spaces without adequate grounds.
He also wants to grant town councils more powers when building new apartments.
May explained: “I said last year that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream, according to which the life of generation to generation should be improved.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build up a life.
However, it cannot be correct that it is just as easy for people who do not live in Britain as well as for companies with a seat abroad to buy real estates as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far away for too many people and the indignity of homelessness remains a too big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My greatest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, Head of Sunderland, says that it is his ‘greatest goal’ to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old shot enjoys the challenge of crushing the association from the north-east of England's new life, which is just on the third place in the League One and lacks the three points to the top.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer after he led St. Mirren back to the first Scottish League in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it on the bank and that was 's," Ross told the mission Sports sound of BBC Scotland.
“But I have often seen Scotland play with my father in Hampden as a child, and that is something that always pulls me back.
However, this option would only come if I was successful in association management."
Ross' predecessors in the role as Sunderland Manager include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Chief of Alloa Athletic indicated not to be afraid to enter the footsteps of such etablated name at such a club after he previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment if I can bring the association back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and the possibilities of this association, he has no doubt belonging to the Premier League," he explained.
"It's not a easy task to get him there, but I'd only estimate my time here as a success if I brought the association back there."
Ross can present a three-year management career, after a phase as vice-chairman at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third League and half St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the mastership in the following season.
Ross says that he feels better than ever in his game career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That was probably a real divorce," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I didn't have a bad job, could live well of it and experienced some very pleasant high stages.
But play can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I still do this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so well in my skin throughout my life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30 p.m., such a study
The heat wave in summer has missed the revenues of the British crisping pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies reported a turnover growth of 2.7 per cent in July. However, revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA Corporate Assembly, which compiled the figures, explained: “Sustainable sunshine and England longer than expected ongoing participation in the football world championship meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, where Pubs could increase sales of 2.8 percent.
The decrease of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with focus on beverages showed with distance the best performance, with a surface-adjusted turnover development that increased higher than they dropped at the restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food also were in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like the people were just trying to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars the sales of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of the analyzers for the recreational and hostage business RSM, explained: “These results continue the trend we could observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sports events remain the biggest factors for turnovers in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight with problems, but revenues of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful in addition to the persistent cost pressure in the previous year.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies with focus on food and it remains waiting for the more moderate temperatures in August to provide the urgently needed atmosphere."
The total turnover growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry turnover monitor Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
One study shows that every fifth child, some once 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret to parents and teachers
A survey of less than 20 000 students in secondary schools has seen an increase in so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message fires fear that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students claimed to own a "main account" to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret to adults.
A survey of 20 000 students in further schools showed a rapid increase of the so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a link to the Photo-Sharing website Instagram.
The message fires fears that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a clean "main account" that they can show their parents, but also private accounts.
A mother who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who called on others to " rape me."
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, giving half the permission to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, explained: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes “the voice of the athletes” in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council at its annual General Assembly.
Doyle is the most outstanding light athletine in Scotland, and the Chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports staff to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the light athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world and we are sure that light athletics in Scotland would benefit very much from their choice in the Council," says Beattie.
Doyle said: “I look forward to working as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead to sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, called four Olympic Gold Medals his own and today often appear as BBC experts, could no longer run after a transient transfusion disturbance.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say nobody can say whether or how far I'm going to cure.
It was hard work, but I have recovered completely, I have learned to run again and do motion exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertising for dairy pumps comparing mothers with cows provides excitement in the network
A manufacturer of dairy pumps provided excitement in the network with an advertising clip in which breast-feeding mothers are compared with the milk of cows.
In order to introduce the market, according to its own indication, “the world's first noise-lower milk pump” published by the consumer technology producer, Elvie, a not very seriously integrated music video to highlight the freedom of the pumping mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a sheep-filled shoe with cows in the background to a song that contains text lines like: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a tail on me” or “if you have not noticed it, these are not yeasts but my breasts.”
The refrain continues: “Put it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the Facebook site of the company has triggered a controversy in the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video stood on mixed reactions among the observers, many of whom say that it is harmless to the “worsts” of the milk industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within few days of birth," it said in a comment.
The dairy pump of Elvie fits dedent into a silent BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was stated: “It is traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: “This is an outstanding advertising.”
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song "urcomic".
“I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would've bought one if I was still quiet.
When I pumped off, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote a person.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertising that is directed to mothers using milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feels like “cooking”.
This is not advertising for or against the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that all have danced with the discrete pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who use dairy pumps indicate to feel like dairy cows.
However, the pump of Elvie is totally noiseless, has no wires or hoses and fits discretely into a silence BH, allowing women to move, keep their babys or even go out during the pump process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD with Mother, explained: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a waiting and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to put milk pumps and all the challenges associated with them in the centre and at the same time imagine the incredible feeling of freedom that enables the new pump.
This isn't the first time that the pump of Elvie squeezed into the slopes.
During the London Fashion Week, for designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a double mother on the Catwalk, while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were brought quietly into a tent city at the Texas border
The number of internal migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly transgressions has remained relatively the same, among other things, since worsening rhetorics and measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult to undergo children in maintainers.
Traditionally, most maintainers were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid to become even a target disc for an excursion when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential maintainers and other adult members of their household would have to deliver their fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of the customs authority immigration and customs enforcement, explained before the Congress that the Authority arrested dozens of people who had been advocated for the care of uncommitted minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no previous records in the criminal register.
“At most 80 percent of the people who are either a maintainer or a member of a household of a maintainer are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore we will continue to persecute these people," explained Albence.
In order to deal with the cases of children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules which, according to the staff of the accommodation in some children, require to appear before court within a month rather than 60 days after the arrest, which was the standard before.
Many will appear via video changing and not personally to enter before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person will be suspended quickly.
The longer these children remain in maintenance, the more likely it is, according to the information of the accommodation employees and reports known in the last month of the system that they are being anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns will be strengthened at a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems, because of its size, will be more easily overlooked.
They also explained that it could strengthen traumas already suffering from many of the children if they were brought into a tent without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish ‘occupational troops’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-President Prime Minister, explained that the foreign forces are illegally found on Syrian ground with the predecession of fighting against terrorism and are ‘treated accordingly’.
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he explained to the congregation.
Moualem claimed that the “war against terrorism was almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011 and millions more people were disposed of from their homes.
He said that Damascus “will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned” both by terrorist groups and“every illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has stationed about 2000 soldiers in Syria, which are mainly trained and advised both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 soil troops in the war poured country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem declared that the conditions for their return were given and accused “a few Western countries” to“ spread irrational fears” the refugees to stop going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to allow return," he said.
"They are actually politics in a pure humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that there was no support for building for Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats explained that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last large rebellenhochburg Idlib represents the possibility of pre-existing political discussions.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging openness of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province, in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed its hope that military measures against Djihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, which will be "deleted".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to call up the first meeting of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and to provide the way to elections.
Moualem called the Syrian Government's conditions for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-elective
With this logic, Trump would win his re-elective election in 2020, should not, as many liberal observers probably hope, end an opinion or a scandal his Presidency in advance.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidency ever".
So far, there are no signs of the sight of the audiences.
Since 2014, the rates for the best shipping time at CNN have doubled to 1.05 million more than that and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million tourists for the best shipping time, compared to 1.7 million years ago. MSNBCs “The Rachel Maddow Show” leaded the rate of catching up to 3.5 million tourists at evenings with important news.
“This is like a fire that attracts people magically, as it is something we do not understand,” says Neal Bear, showrunner of the "Designed Survivor" drama series on the TV broadcaster ABC over a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before election in 2016.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘because he brings me to laugh’’, Scovell told me.
The chaos has an entertainment value.
Of course, the stories from Washington, as opposed to what is available in television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortion Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families and the health of the global economy.
The shutdown is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged spectators.
And yet, it is important to be an informed citizen when you are aware that you have already watched six hours of an expert round, the use of Bob Woodward's sources from the so-called "deep background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manaforts $15,000 expensive Bomber Jacket from Straußenleder (such as Washington Post is a "clearing piece of self-review") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's rippery description of trumps, em, discussed anatomy.
For my part, I will never see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“A part of what he does, it feels like a reality show that he sets up for you every evening”, says Brent Montgomery, main business manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the series “The Three of the Pfand House”, about trumps rotating occupation and daily actions (a dispute with the Football-Liga NFL break from the tooth, prize Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a consequence, or you can't come with it anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crushed himself inside and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't solve himself from the screen, not when Judge Kandidat Brett Kavanaugh was shortly in front of saying to the Senate Jurisdiction Committee and the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we made all these crazy missions at the time and the people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought this was a kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Donation money flows the closest races around the congress at the intermediate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania is overflowed by donations, thanks to the new boundaries of the electoral district, which led to two officials in the race around the same seat.
The recently newly drawn suburban district in Pittsburg lets the Democrat Conor Lamb enter, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb resigns against another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who strongly crosses with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were destroyed against the Constitution and manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a battle exchange of electoral funding between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a little victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th electoral district of the State.
This seat was held by a Republican over a decade and trump won the front with 20 percentage points.
Police experts give the democrats a light lead.
The US examined El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then returned
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized without pushing on major resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump held a friendship meeting with President Panama's Juan Carlos Valero and had a hotel in Panama to throw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officers of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw the leaders of all American foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", says Heather Nauert, speaker of the Ministry in an opinion of the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, there were penalties that were estimated to have received $ 140 million of US aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment rates and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar assembly last year and represented one step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
In the mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively terminate the consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now a speaker at the conference set at mid-October in order to set a sign of the importance of the government of the congregation, according to diplomats.
The three American diplomatic representatives have returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new sharp communications or penalties from Washington.
A government speaker by John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to speak on the internal meetings under the condition of anonymity.
Their opinions were confirmed by one of the government's close external analysts, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next great surprise could be the report of the specialist Robert Mueller on Trump's possible judicial disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is now claiming to examine whether Trump's electoral team has conspired with Russia when he attacks the American elections.
If the majority of the congress changes, the Trump faces a body that forces him to be accountable, just at the time when he fails to come back to the voters; and perhaps before a sworn jury.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trumps, or the case of its European pendants, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a state war against Hitler if the West had only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and one way fails to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history is about such turning points and the inevitable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just faced with several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump leaves the Vice-President of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein in the Devil's cuisine since this newspaper last year reported that he suggested to record the President secretly and wondered whether the office was inappropriate.
Rosenstein denotes the representation of the New York Times.
“How will we answer if the newly ordered FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or is confirmed in the office despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false statement?
And above all, will we vote in the intermediate elections for a congress that forces tromps to account?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead.
But I think we will not fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jewish, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me off 60 years later to inflamme Sabbath candles on the table with the crook cross.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remise against Villareal in Spain will put it into a good position for the qualification of the group G of Europe League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to 2-2 equality against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for largers.
"This was an important point for us, since Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can do something of it and we went home with a point.
Perhaps we could have won at the end, but a total disagreement was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a serious party, since they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we can go through with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with all what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feeling factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good on it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward now, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of age care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants of the survey knew exactly how to care for them, few talked about it to their family members.
Approximately half of the participants in the National Wide Study indicated to talk to your spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent claimed to talk to their children about it.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Life insurancespare of Nationwide.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be cared, as these decisions may be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial adviser on board: Your consultant can also help you find a way to finance these expenditure.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include a traditional health insurance, a hybrid capital-based life insurance to help cover these costs or self-security with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn up disputes in the last minute.
If you set up a precautionary authority so that you are responsible for a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals comply with your wishes, you should be excluded from expressing them yourself.
Consider also a full power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who takes financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines or allergies?
Record these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only the financial issues play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the drug treatment?"
Who cares for the dog?
You have already finished this plan."

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a Tsunami, who met the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. The number of dead should still increase.
As a result of the lost communication systems, auxiliary forces were not able to receive information from the Dongga Government district, a region north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength 7,5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggal on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and Tsunami occurred.
Dongga is a government district extending over a coastal area of over 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, lived in 2017 estimated 299.200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue from the economy Central Sulawesis, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel degradation is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Dongga have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Casastal Protection Authority.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggla.
West-Donggala was hit in 1996 by a Tsunami, where nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismian Pacific fire ring, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatras triggered a tsunami that met 14 countries and cost 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of which in Aceh.
2005: A number of heavy earthquakes shook the western coast of Sumatras between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias islands outside the coast of Sumatras.
2006: A earthquake with the strength of 6.8 shook the southern Javas, Indonesia's most populated island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and demanded almost 700 death victims.
2009: A earthquake with the strength hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake with the strength 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres high, destroying dozens of villages and demanding about 300 lives.
2016: A light earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and Tsunamis in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died through crashing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes encountered the popular Indonesian island of Lombok by tourists and in particular demanded over 500 death victims on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palins son arrested for punishment of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former candidates for the Vice-President's office, was arrested due to claims of body injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of the suspicion of domestic violence, the disability of the reporting of domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, such a report published by the Alaska Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a familiar person when he wanted to contact the police.
Palin is located in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility, according to KTUU, and a deposit of $500 was raised.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was asked for his plan with "not guilty, certainly" answered the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three infringements of class A, which can be committed with up to a year's prison and a penalty of up to USD 250.000.
He is also charged with a Class B infringement that can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin was punished.
In December 2017 he was conceived to have attacked his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently negotiated before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was encountered by domestic violence, disability of the reporting of a crime and arms possession under the influence of the infringement in conjunction with the incident.
His friend wanted him to hit her in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by Veteran organisations in 2016 after retroducing her son's behavior to a post-traumatic disturbance due to his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a earthquake that the Indonesian island shake Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been interrupted and it is assumed that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place shortly before the coast of Central Sulawesis, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the Tsunami met on the coast.
Federal lawyer is calling for rare death penalties for suspiciouss in New York's terrorist attack
The federal lawyer in New York demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack of New York City, who cost eight human lives. This is a rare penalty which has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a hired pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, while traveling in October on a bike road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, travelling walks and bicycles.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “determinedly” and “consciously” severe body injuries, says the intentional declaration for the claim of death penalty submitted in the southern New York district.
Both charges could be punished by death, according to the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal trial court of Saipov submitted an accusation in 22 points, covering eight charges of murder against the background of organised crime, usually used by state lawyers in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires "final planning and intent", according to the chargers who, in which Saipov carried out the act, described as "awful, cruel and corrupt".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco harm, pain and losses”, explains.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally condemned a lifelong penalty for freedom in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York during a federal proceedings, was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been deceived two years before the conspiracy of spionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, was born in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, according to judicial documents.
He told researchers to feel good with what he did, so the police.
Saipov declared to the authorities that he was inspired in fact after he had watched videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the accusation.
He also asked police to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 accusations.
David Patton, one of the public Federal Defence Officers who represented Saipov, declared that they were “disappointed by themselves” because of the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of a debt consent in exchange for a lifelong freedom penalty without the possibility of dismissal, will only extend the trauma that all stakeholders suffer," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had asked the accusation before not demanding the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage sworn to mobilise “the power of the people” today during a protest action under the Tories Conference.
The former Head of Parties of Ukip explained that politicians must feel “the pressure” of the Euroskeptics, while a Member of the Party of Theresa May suggested that Farage should lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative rear benchman Peter Bone explained to the demonstrant in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “prepared out” if Farage Brexit minister.
The challenge that May faces in the reconciliation of their deeply distressed parties was strengthened by the participation of members of your party who are for a stay in the EU in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems with keeping her compromise plan Chequer's, despite the attacks of the Brexit advocates, Brexit consignees and the EU on the course.
In spite of the counter-reactions, allies were to continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and therefore to force Euroskeptics and the opposed Labour Party to decide between their package and the Chaos.
Bone explained on the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihul that ‘Chequers belongs to the waste’.
He suggested that Farage had been appointed to a peer and should have given him the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he was responsible, we were already outside,’ he explained.
The Chairman of Wellingborough added: ‘I will admit to the Brexit, but Chequers belong to the waste.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: ‘We have not fought in world wars to be subject.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.’
Bone rejected claims that the public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed its opinion and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit-president of the Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and explained to the reporters: ‘I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unloved in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unloved in our own party and with our activists, who actually go through the streets and ensure that we are chosen.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a top message to May, she continued: ‘Premier Minister keeps her jobs when you keep their promises.’
Farage explained in a speech that politicians must ‘feel the pressure’, they should be just involved in deceiving the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class’, says Farage.
‘They are trying to deceive the Brexit, and therefore we are here today to say to them, ‘this is not why you come from it’.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, who is shortly before betraying the Brexit, feel the pressure.
‘We mobilise the power of the people of this country, which will help us to conquer in the referendum and never get to rest, as long as we are not independent, self-administering, proud United Kingdom.’
At the same time, Brexit consignors marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour kundgement in the city centre.
A few activists swallowed the Banner of Tories against Brexit grouping, a group of Brexit conceivers within May's party, which was launched in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app when opening the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ says Adonis.
‘This is a farce.
There is the good Brexit simply not,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ presidential candidate
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren explained that after the elections in November, she would “examine the candidateship of the presidentship.”
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke on Saturday at a meeting with choosers in West Massachusetts about her future.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, is just in the race for the re-electuring of the Senate against the Republican Members of Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of Trump's election team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the center of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been the 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's office arrived.
One of the people present asked her if you wanted to candidate for the presidency.
Warren replied that for women at the time it would be "to go to Washington and repair our destroyed government and that includes women at the top."
Arrest by death shots on LSU player Sims
The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspicious in the case of the deadly shots on LSU Basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested by Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference to arrest the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had published a video of shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to see the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Southern University Campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shot injury on the head and died as a result of this injury," explained the sports media portal 247 sports by Police Chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to have been at the site and possession of a gun and shot on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and was arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

Great price of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after his team has left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in the qualifying front of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Stack Order of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost as if he had Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton run into traffic at the end of the driver field, a decision that should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton retreated him after a little bike-to-rad manöver, where the Ferrari pilot deliberately released the inside side to endure the risk after two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began on one of the rear places of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round on place seven.
He was then for a large part of the fastest race, since he stopped at his tyres to close quickly and pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he went into the 44th round and did not take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkones ended as four.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri brought a great performance throughout the weekend and acted as a true gentleman as he had to leave me.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made a joke on Saturday at a election event about Senator Dianne Feinstein, who persisted not to pass on to the press the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he pretends to the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not express his statement directly before the Senate's Jurisdiction Committee, but commented that the operations in the Senate show that people are “common, evil and unearly”.
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and malicious and evil and dishonest," said the President.
“When you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Posted the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, please, please.
If we have... no, we haven't published it," he added by imitating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent to the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was published at the beginning of September. However, Feinstein argues that the leak comes from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn't publish your story”, explained Feinstein according to the statement by The Hill to the Committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request for confidentiality."
Your Dementi seemed not to come well to the President, who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you one, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defence of the Judge Candidate, which is prosecuted by three women, the Democrats claimed to use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to conquer the power with all means.
You see the commonity, the evil, they don't care for who they hurt when they let them fall under the wheels to maintain power and control," explained the President according to the mediaite.

Flights died after he made sure that hundreds of people escape the earthquake in a plane
A flight lot in Indonesia is celebrated as hero after finding the death to let a plane with hundreds of people start on board safely.
More than 800 people died and many are missed after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong descendants are still to feel in the region and many people are caught in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his posts in the strongly varied control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He continued to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the start train at the time, could be safely removed.
He then jumped out of the Tower when he thought he crashed.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, speaker of the Indonesian Aviation Security Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, says Australia’s ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died tomorrow before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to several thousand. The National Disaster Protection Authority explained that access to the cities of Donggla, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of bodies will probably continue to rise, as many are still under the drums, while others cannot be reached," said the speaker of the Authority Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves with up to 6 meters of height have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing auxiliary and supply goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: “Every minute a new hospital car comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is short.
Supermarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN explained: “The Indonesian Red Cross is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and explained in a talk before the military of the country: “I ask you to work every day and night to perform all the tasks accompanying the evacuation.
Since you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia has already been shaken this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports of a missing aircraft crash in Lagune
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific Lagune in Micronesia now reports of a missing person after first claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the falling plane.
Air Niugini explained in a communication that they could not say anything about the stay of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The Airline indicated to cooperate with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The Airline did not answer immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane had crashed into water when landing at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officers declared that seven people had to be brought to a hospital.
The airline indicated that on Saturday, six passengers were still in the hospital but were in a stable state.
The cause and the precise outcome of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both declared that the plane was landing in the Lagune shortly before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane was flying out of the railway.
The U.S. Passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very flat.
"This is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wash to the emergency exits on the sides of the falling plane.
He said that the air carriers paniced and shouted and he suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that seafarers who worked near the improvement of an installation site hurried with a blowable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane dropped deep water in about 30 feet (100 feet).
The data of the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 persons were killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them covered Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the end of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the accusation concluded her proof in the new negotiation of a case in which a man is sentenced to ban a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The Analytic of the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett said that he was an expert in the field of information evaluation for hours.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers during the period in which he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand on Saturday and said that he hadn't been in the city on the day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had said the truth when he claimed to be in Sanford's Pick-Up this night, Sandford said he had lied, “because my pick-up was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated to have known Chambers at their death date two weeks.
Mobile recordings showed that they knew themselves a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis lost their news, calls and contact information from his cell phone a while after Chamber's death.
"He took them out of his life," said Hale.
The defense will expect their plans to begin on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the procedure will then take place before the jury on this day.

Another black?!
New Yorker child girl complains pairs for a dismissal to "racist" SMS
A New York child girl complains a couple because of a discriminatory dismissal after she received a misleading message from the mother in which he complained that she was “other a black one”.
The couple struggled to be racist and compared the dispute with a “depression”.
The two-fold mother Lynsey Plasco Flexman expressed her disturbance when she found out that the new day mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she entered her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEIN, NO NO SWARZE,” Plasco Flexman wrote her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice. Two times.
After she recognized her fauxpass, the Plasco-Flaxman Maurice, who had been touched and claimed that the enclosed Afro-American day mother had done bad work and instead she expected a Philippine, the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice complains about compensation for discharge and claims compensation for the 350 dollars per day, which it should have been booked for over six months, for which the job was originally booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived in the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do something like that," she explained the newspaper on Friday, "I know that discrimination is."
The pair rejected the racism claims and argued that the dismissal of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice after they had insulted them to no longer be able to trust.
“My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a rassist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was unhearted to them, even if it was mistaken?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute with a “depression” and explained that his wife expects a baby in just two months and is “in a difficult situation”.
“You want to be interested in such a person?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the dispute continues, the couple in the public were quickly condemned and appealed to the social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speaking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It is difficult to put into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our today's knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the child book, had not had any problem with it, would have been rejected his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death last year was “bitter sweet”.
She explained that your father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as “very important family member.”
"He was a very quiet man and didn't praise," said Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having a child that does something special: you're proud, even if it wasn't really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors forfeited to save their lives.
"Nad called regularly to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors gave her little chances," says Ednan Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines you gave the doctors to keep their heart pumped, slowly sounded down and left their body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to screw myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieved for the loss of her daughter, and the other passengers who did not get any of what she did, on board the plane.
"No one knew it," she said.
I had dropped my head and tears ran over my wings all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their families through one suicide strive to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hang on a bridge in Wales Maps with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting offices.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 years old when he started suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel like I feel every day,” she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had an inflammatory smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smiles could lighten a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, as he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014 Tyler's body was found after suicide by his 11-year-old brother.
Davis explained: "I always fear that this could have a consequence."
Davis has designed the cards “to show the people that there are people to go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't stay quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was at the deep point. When the children packed out their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that she had to go through: “It is a huge hole in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the sweep while the FBI starts researching
"I thought that if we could actually get something like that he asked for, so a timely and limited determination, we might be able to get a little interference," said Flake on Saturday.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want investigations from the FBI?
Their opposition can be reversed to the timing alone.
The intermediate elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans were badly cut off as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush took the phone listener to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents his report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where the present 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to decide at equality of vote and to confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean runners ‘sink’ under Kim
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has fallen from Kim Jong-un seven years ago to power, so a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-sug, who calls on data from the South Korean Reunion Ministry, explained that last year 1127 overlaids were registered compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as main factors.
Pyongang did not express itself publicly.
The large majority of the northern overlaids will eventually be offered to the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, over 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the overlaids more illegal immigrants than refugees and often leads them back with violence.
The relationships between the north and the south, which are still technically seen in the state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
In the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pjonghang for discussions that were about the denuclearing negotiations.
This was due to the historic meeting between President Donald Trump and President of the United States in Singapore and Kim Jong-un in June, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without be able to rely on the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to first disarmb our own side," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for the office at the Supreme Court of Justice
The minority leader at the Nancy Pelosi House called Judge Kandidaten Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was characteristic of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t reject the impression that a woman who had acted so would have been called ‘hysterical’,” said Pelosi about her reaction to the statement by Kavanaugh before the Senate's Jurisdiction Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally declared all the accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed fast and stood in tears shortly before when he talked about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a "great and coordinated call murder" organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believes that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as she shows that he was admitted to Democrats.
“I believe that he has declared himself unacceptable with these statements and the way he moved about the Clintons and Democrats,” she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to reject Kavanaugh of the Office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority of the representatives' house.
"I will say so much: if he does not say the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judge positions," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a recent judge at the Bundesrufungsgericht in Washington D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that as a democrat, she is concerned about possible decisions Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion foundation decision Roe v. Wade, as it is estimated to be a conservative judge.
In his hearings Kavanaugh asked whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We need no hysterical person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Ah this is not wonderful’,” said Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a gun.
It is a sincere hatred speech, months and years of overcrowding anger, and it doesn't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was somewhere manager and said that when she becomes angry, she also cryed, but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person to whom she said: “You may think that herself is sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then they're just talking on.
I found this brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories is a former job, in a office dominated by men, where I one day cried because of an indescriptive anger and was drawn into a staircase by an older woman, a under cooled manager who I always had a little fear of.
“Let her never see that you are crying,” she told me.
“You don't know you're stink-sauger.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with yourself because they believe you have gone into the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when hard on board a ship named Monkey Business was captured in an outer marriage affair and then moved back his candidature, the deeply frustrated schroeder thought that there was no reason to consider the idea of presidency candidatur.
“This wasn’t a well-threatening decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow white and the seven dwarfs’.
Since the electoral struggle had already been advanced, it was at the back of the funding, and she sworn not to advocate if she should not get 2 million dollars together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated $1000, only supported their campaign with $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she asked.
In the speech she announced not to start an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, thankfulness for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the funding and direct addressing of the electors rather than the delegates, as well as the anger of sexism, that she was close to the tears.
“You could have assumed that I had a nervous collapse," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the bag clothing manufacturer Kleenex had been my sponsor.
I remember that I was wondering what they would write on my grave stone.
"You wept?"
Why Beijing could benefit from trade war between the USA and China
The opening anointings of the trade war between the United States and China were ear deep. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Peking could benefit from a long-term grave between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, fired the first warning shot at the beginning of the year, when he charged important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with criminal duties.
The most important escalation took place this week with new criminal duties on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Beijing reversed in the same way every time and recently raised penalty from five to ten percent to US goods worth $60 billion.
China swore to respond to any measure of the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon be stumbled.
To move Washington to lead, would mean to give up. However, a public incline against the US would be too delightful for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays his cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependency of both economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulencies in both countries is actually far more dangerous than many observers previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who focuses on Asia at the Denkfabrik Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and asks for help for the restoration of the devastated country by the longer than seven years of war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the circumstances in the country improve.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he explained.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to allow normality to come in.
All the conditions were now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had their everyday life and life bases.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomes help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that there would not be any conditions-related assistance from countries which had supported the rebellion.
Europe reached a victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated the United States team with a end of 16,5 to 10,5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has no longer won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14,5 points it needed to defeat the US.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over a large part of the tournament, lowered his decline on the 16th railway (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Gulf Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds and was one of 4 players who achieved a 5-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team of Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the best ranking worldwide, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, Veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player at all times with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I couldn’t stop.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas selected me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to get back the pocal.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have made a contribution," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues the fackle to his countryman John Rahm, who won the American Gulf-Ling Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual meetings.
I am so incredibly proud to have hit Tiger Woods, which I have been following in television since my childhood," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all times who won 14 important tracks and only overwhelmed by Jack Nicklaus.
The team of the USA had the whole weekend problems to find the Fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had high-quality performance during the whole tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time tonight when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Look out for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players made a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
