Members of the Wallian Assembly worried they're going to look like foolish.
There is an inquiry among some members of the meeting on the proposal to change their title from AM to MWP (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Wallian Parliament.
Members of all over the political spectrum are afraid that it can cause a ridicule.
One member of the Worker Party says his group is concerned because "it's rhyming with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wallis: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means discharge.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Wallian Conservative Party says his group is "releasant" about the change of name, but noticed that it is a short prompt of speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Wallian letter w is expressed as the Yorkshire-English statement of the letter you.
The Meeting Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any description of what is called members of the meetings, of course, will be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Wallian meeting the power to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals which had been widely supported to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the AM, the Welsh Parliament has chosen members or WMPs, but the MWP option has received most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's seems to be producing alternatives, but the struggle to gain consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who must present a legislative proposal in weeks on the changes.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the meeting's working methods, including rules on discrimination of AMs and the draft committee system.
AM'e's will get the last saying in the question of what they should be called when they debate the law.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change of country’s name
Choosers will vote on Sunday if their country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote is arranged in an effort to eliminate a decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens already insists for a long time that the name of his neighbor in the north represents a claim in his territory and has repeatedly captured his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the national vote on the change of name, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bell of Saint Martin's becomes silent because churches in Harlem are struggling.
"Historically spoken," said the old people to whom I spoke, there was a bar and a church was on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"No one of the two is there anymore today."
He says that the disappearance of crowns is understandable.
"Men are socializing today in other ways," he said.
"Craves are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people are going regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money is not going to hold as long as leaders expect, "and earlier or later they're back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refugees.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and therefore will bring the day that these churches completely close even closer, because most of the people who enter these condomins will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropool - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building’s title.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the direction of Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boikot from retailers in 125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to appoint or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s members planned to rebuild it, they ordered the carillion.
Eerw. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillion "the poor people's bells".
The expert who played the carillion in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a indispensable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carillion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillion 18 years ago at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says that Saint Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been playing in Saint Martin's in the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lectures of the church, others by the Episcopal Bisdom.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, consisting of lectures - wrote to the Bishop in July with concern that the bisdom "will try to transfer the costs" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the bisdom.
Some members of the congregation complain about a lack of transparency from the bisdom's side.
Hai injures 13-year-old on crown dive in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured when he diving for lobsters on the first day of the crown season in California, says officials.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was dying with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yell for help and then roared with a group closer to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first caught, but then he realized 'that he cried,' I was bite!
I'm bited!
His entire key bone was shaken up," Hammel saw when he came out of the son.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water, 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flying to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known what shark type is responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media information session that a shark was noticed a few weeks ago in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had experienced traumatic injuries on the upper part of his upper body.
Officers closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for reasons of investigation and safety.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planned extension to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are fighting with branch store-type beauty gates managed by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while selling fashion and households fall back, the larger beauty gates in 11 stores across the country will be tested and if it has been successfully taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill racks used once for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's says that it will double the size of his available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with trademark specific areas similar to those that can be seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also starts his Boutique-Grimming series again so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something more younger buyers demand.
In addition, the parfum small dealer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, whose first last week opened in Croydon in South London and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of costs that are purchased daily at local convenience shops means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops are going to look more like department shops when the supermarket chain is trying to fight back with more services and non-food products against the discount shops Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's put Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it bought both these chains two years ago, which, according to their herbs' sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermark’s previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint company with Boots in the early 2000s, but the ratio was ended after an argument about how the profit from the pharmaceuticals should be divided within its shops.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's 281 shop had sold its appetite for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive series of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty gates to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be at hand to provide advice.
Our series of trade names are designed to provide every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations means that we are now a regional beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'worn' after Holly Willoughby withdraws £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-Sterne Peter Jones went away 'worn' after TV provider Holly Willoughby had withdrawn her to a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle trademark business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their house clothes and accessibility trade name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning provider, 37, announced her withdrawal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing their profitable lifestyle trademark business at the last moment - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "worn" when TV's gold girl on Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to $1.5 million - mean that she can't spend enough time on their home clothing and accessibility trade name, Truly.
The business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled, according to dedicated Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she left Truly, Jones climbed on a rayer and exchanged Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at far.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her through the coming few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was totally stupid.
No one could believe Tuesday what was happening, it was so close to the announcement.
There is a packhouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that is right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's stars that make the most money flow, can chase the company millions out of the bag due to the enormous investment in products stretching from kissings and candles to clergy and house clothing, and the possibility that its announcement can encounter even more delays.
And this could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples keep holiday together and Jones own a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is going to become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business matters."
Hard words, and we get in love.
He was ridiculous about criticism that he would get from the news media because he had made a comment that some would view as "unpresident" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
said Trump in his camema-"new reader voice".
"I have given up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first conversation in June in Singapore as a great step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament burned.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said to leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that the North does not see a "conform reaction" from the U.S.A. on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues with penalties aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic impact in his convention talk.
"We progress excellently with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim resulted in positive results — it ended fire - arrow tests, helped liberate hostages, and caused the rest of American soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10.000 people out there trying to come into 'this stumpful arena, we would have had almost 200 people standing there," said Trump while he pointed to the crowd right before him.
Cigarettes and earthquake in Indonesia ruined island, hundreds of death
In the follow-up of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population was disrupted, no national disaster was announced, a prerequisite to catalyticize international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they did not ask for international help, which makes it a little difficult," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are compiling a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the effort to assist.
Given the earth’s shaking that Indonesia constantly endures, the land remains sadly weakly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunam exchanges were built in Aceh, it is not a common face on other coastlines.
The seeming lack of a tsunami warning cires in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a warning of power.
It is most challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia’s diminished infrastructure a core point of his electoral campaign and spent silent money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Yoko’s administration is threatened by funding shortages as he faces reselection next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces the pressure of striking sectarian stress in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim multitude accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of detonated as Christian and Muslim bands fought with capmes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge shot good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in London from a premierliga loss against Chelsea for a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri indicated to Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea goal and his team 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before he shot far to the target stake.
The effort sailed high over the frame as it was floating to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball thrust over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to come in that position, to come on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw sides come and typed once and didn't think too much about it and just shot."
By half time, Chelsea was 1-0 before after the Belgian star Eden Hazard registered a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' target head played in that play room with a back-up head again to Mateo Kovacic before he numbed near the middle field and in the Liverpool half engine.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-scope, he then led to Hazard into the window.
Hazard passed the defense and ended with a left foot-scope past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farest target net.
Liverpool runs the battle against Napoli at Wednesday 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Napels, Italy.
Chelsea arrives on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europe League.
Death number rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death rate in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed up to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were caught under the waste of buildings that had hit the earthquake, which had crashed on Friday at a range of 7.5 and caused burners of up to 20 feet, said the agency vocabulary Sutopo Purwo Nugroho to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its over 380,000 people, was sowed with the ruin of collapsed buildings.
Police arrests man, 32, under suspicion of murder after a woman has been killed
A murder investigation was sent out of stock after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found in Grayson Mews at John Street at 7.55 p.m. with messtresses, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area that had heard or seen anything to come forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation is in an early stage, but I appeal to anyone who was in the area of John Street in Birkenhead who had seen or heard anything suspected, to contact us.
I also call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam film material, to contact us because they may have information that might be essential for us to examine."
A Police Speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman at the scene came to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continued as the police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s nearby.
A taxi manager who lived in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
Inhabitants are now said it will take hours before they are released.
It was heard that a police officer said to one man that the whole area is now treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said "it's so horrible."
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officials are left inside the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to switch @MerPolCC DM, 101, or connect criminal stops anonymously to 0800 555 111 with log 247 of September 30 as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes the latest memorandum with ‘rewrite history’ dispute
His banishment will be poetic justice for its Taliban destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritean followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "sootness" and "a attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said, "It was inevitably in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the shape of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The picturestorms of the English civil wars were neither ordered by Cromwell nor executed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s maniphic illustration of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historical recording of a figure that many believes are still anniversary.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defenders of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate illustration, the subject of continued historical debate.
What is determined is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognisable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protective Ruler is also worthy of celebration and anniversary."
Murderfish Destroyed Chinese Boer
A farmer, according to local media reports, was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in Southwest China.
The man, which was identified only by his of "Yuan", was found dead with a diluted blood-covered artery near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
According to the reports on Wednesday, he traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and found a door to a nearby pig.
He said there was a great male pig in the cave with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeded and broken," the cousin, who was called on the side, "Wu," said, quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera material showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found some an hour later.
The animal who killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A Mark Manager said to the Evening New that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities claim to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although weird, cases of pigs that attack people have been reported before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pounds-fowl had put a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife had shocked the animal.
After a farmer of Oregon had been eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer of Manitoba said to CBS News that pigs were not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood could act as "faster".
"They're not playing.
They're little bits, very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just need to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res from Orcan Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern USA.
As foretold, Orcan Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rain across northern Mexico and southwestern USA over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a category 1 orchestra, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a troop over the Pacific begins to take shape and move eastward to the west coast of the U.S., as Rosa Monday approaches the Baja Californic Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northwest of the US into the southwest.
Rosa will bring rain to parts of Mexico from up to 10 inches on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching troop, tropical moisture will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous floods, wasteflows, and possibly landfills in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rain rates from up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Quick floods may be with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to wager in the wilderness with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deeply devastating rivers and thunderstorms to bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trug will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rain rates of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low flow of waste and smooth runways.
It will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some spread tropical rainfall will begin Arizona late Sunday and early Monday approaching before the rain is late Monday and Tuesday widespread.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature shields throughout the U.S. as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropes remain very hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences throughout the Central USA is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, numerous summer heats will try to rise and expand.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern US will begin warm October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Low Level to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher probability of bow average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
Over 20 million people looked at six television networks on Thursday at the fascinating testimony of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault claimed to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political dead point continued, with broadcasters who interrupt regular programs for Friday's on-the-snippet turn: an agreement established by Arizona-senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week's investigation.
Ford said to the Senate-Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to pull her clothes out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people looked at it on Friday, reports Nielsen.
The company counted average watchstal on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Figures were not available immediately for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people looking in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was all the networks before with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day’s hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flakes were the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was captured on Friday morning at CNN and CBS where objectors shouted on him when he tried to take a lift to a judicial committee.
He stood with a few minutes of beaten eyes while CNN lively pictured how he was being said badly.
"I stand right here before you," said one woman.
'Do you think he tells the country the truth?
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before the lift door went, said that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks all covered live hours later when the Legal Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said he would do this only with the mind that the FBI would look at the accusations against the candidate for the next week, as the Democratic Minority requested.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Demokraat-senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the voices to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated a FBI investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of 'political game' about Brexit
First Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political playery" with Britain's future and the undermining of national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times course.
Britain’s First Minister Theresa May arrives on 29 September 2018 for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview next to one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Minister for Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should invoke each other's tariffs was "final ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrests suspected Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shot death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on an accusation of second-grade murder, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officers issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the struggle.
The police found back the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-affiliated WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His casting train was fixed at $350,000, reported the lawyer.
The judicial vision office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday that says that the cause of death was a gun wound at the head of the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's refugee task force, the State Police's crime laboratory, Southern University Police and territorial citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanks regional law application for his "eagerness and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 backwards per bet.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball trainer Will Wade said the team in "peaked" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about at a time," said Wayde.
Volcano Spying as on Mexico City
As sprayed from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital reached.
The National Center for Ramp Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after activity had taken up in the crater and registered in 24 hours 183 releases of gas and ashes.
The center monitored multiple triggers and shakings.
Images on social media showed how thin low gas motor windscreens cover near Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 miles) southeast of the capital since a earthquake with a size of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflicts with Catalonian separatists before anniversary of independence voice
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence antagonists had fought unluste politics, and thousands joined in contraceptions to remember the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for infirmation.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by unluste police coated with eggs and cast powder that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually wept from tourists.
A stoutry also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their knockles to keep the battle in tooth.
In several hours, pro-independence groups sang on one tone "No forget, no forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionists' cry of "Lank Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for small injuries caused in the processions, reported the local press.
The tension continues to run high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October by Madrid was considered illegal but was celebrated by separateist Catalans.
Choices voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against infirmation who largely boyoted the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried in violent collisions to prevent the voting at the voting rooms throughout the region.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia to gain independence.
"Last year we had passed one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying of joy because they could vote but now stick us,” he said.
Despite a vital but nail-breaking victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most famous leaders, either in self-exile or in imprisonment for their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fought by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in preliminary hearing since late last year, announced that he would be in European Parliament's elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for European elections is the best way to approve the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car ride home

Menga target gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s First Purpose for Livingston assured Victory
Promoted Livigston was surprised by Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 bets as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s purpose was proof of the difference when Gary Holt’s team with Hibernian moved to the second.
Gerrard's team stayed that season in the Premiership without a disappearance and came to the front of the foregoing Heart, which is their eight points.
Rangers are only Thursday host for Rapid Vienna in the Europeliga.
Meanwhile, Livingston spreads their unconquered loop in the division to six bets, with chief trainer Holt who still did not make a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston plays chances against bot visitors
Holt's team must have passed ahead long before they signed a goal, with their round breastliness that Rangers had brought all sorts of problems on their neck.
SR broke through, but was behaving before the target hook, then AL could only play wide after he had approached and met CH’s headache across the hook.
The hosts were satisfied to let Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with mortal playtimes.
And thus the decisive purpose came.
Rangers left a freescope and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who together gave Menga the chance to kick and sign a goal from the middle of the frame.
By that stage, Rangers had dominated but could not impose the home defense, and Liam Kelly was mostly uncarried.
That pattern was continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos had forced a turn from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by the feet of Rangers target guardian Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was widely typing to avoid yet open game of Livingston.
Overcruises repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and stopped repeatedly, while two penalties — after Halkett’s challenge of replacement Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were dismissed.
‘Fenomenal’ of Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal games and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward job.
Their game style and crew are almost unchanged since their return to the first place, but a lot of honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was enormous with his maniphesic defence arrangement while Menga for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their teeth.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they could push through the home team, which is somewhat of a wake call for Rangers, which they are in middle division.
Erdogan gets mixed receptions in Cologne
Saturday (September 29) smiled and blue air when leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had an injury on issues including human rights, freedom of press, and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan was then to Köln to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the 25,000-star crowd from gathering before the mosque but many supporters arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan representatives – many of their Kurdies – also made their voices thick and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The fighting demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor who is greeted by some German Turks as heroes and is extruded as autoocracy by others.
Deptford Pad Accident: Cycler dies in collision with engine
A bicycler died in a collision in London where a car was involved.
The collision occurred around 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another bicycler died in a step-and-trap in Childers Street, about a mile of where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials are working to identify the man and attend his neighbors.
Road locks and bus circuits were put in place, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guardians damaged in rebellion
Six guards were injured in an oproer at a high security-man prison, said the prison office.
Invasion broke out on Sunday around 09:30 BST and was still running at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado guardians" were invited to handle the revolt, including eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for low facial injuries.
A prisoner spokesman said, "Specially trained prison staff are deployed to give attention to a continued insident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay longer behind stairs."
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous transgressors.
In June, it was reported that after he had been attacked by a prisoner, the head of the prisoner received hospital treatment.
And in October last year, unluste officials were invited to pay attention to serious misorders in which staff with billions of balls were attacked.
Orca Rosa Dreg Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Quick Floods (Droogteregions Trek Dalk Benefits)
It's uncommon that a tropical low pressure hits Arizona but that's exactly what could happen early next week if Orcan Rosa's remaining energy moves over the southwest desert and brings rapid flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood guards for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and late on Monday will approach with rain.
In a twit, the National Weather Service in Phoenix noticed that only "twen tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Orcan Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogolon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Come, will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside the immediate flood risk, Rosa’s rain will probably be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall will probably be beneficial because the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the US Dry Monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona have at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First, Orkaan Rosa leads its path to approaching land throughout the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at the orphans of Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles [385 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets cooler water in the Pacific, so her power decreases.
Thus, it is expected that Monday or evening will reach the country by tropical storm strength in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico may be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Falls of rain from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then, if a tropical storm moves north over Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border in the early morning hours as a tropical depression and then will move through Arizona and to southern Utah at late Tuesday evening.
"The biggest danger expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the US Southwest," said the National Orcan Center.
It is expected that this rain can cause life - threatening floods and ruins in the deserts and ground shifts in the mountainlike areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempts to kill
Three teenager sons a 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempt to murder after a 16-year-old with stuck wounds found in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officers appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone image material of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'has suffered under the common, the anger' of the Democratic Party.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "had suffered under the common, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and strongly and emotionally denied a claim from Christine Blasey Ford that he had attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified her claim during the trial.
The President said Saturday the Americans saw "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most qualified legal spirits of our time, a jurisdiction with a pure record of public service," he said to the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president directly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of Republican entry at the middle-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I don't stand, but actually I stand," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first important procedure vote on the Senate floor about Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later as Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant said to CNN.
Hundreds of death due to Indonesian shaking, tsunami, with still rising figures
At least 384 people were dead, and many swamped away when giant waves broke on the beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach on Friday in the city of Palu for a festival on the beach when burners broke up to six feet (18 feet) high at sunset on the beach, washed away many after their death and destroyed all that was on the road.
The tsunami followed after a 7.5 volume of earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came up yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of Indonesia's disaster lighting agency GDP during a information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on his own, it slept cars, stumps, houses, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated after 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that were distorted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterchocks were still shaking the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for the Evaluations and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s gigantic shaking was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the point of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "awesome" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shop centers, and hotels collapsed.
Bodys of some victims were found where they were trapped among the ruins of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the accidents and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 miles [190 miles] north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake card.
Communication "is completely obscured with no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are over 30,000 people living there, said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it could get much worse," they said.
The agency was criticized widely on Saturday because they did not tell that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said that the waves came at the time of the warning.
In amateur image material divided on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard desperate warnings about the coming tsunami crying to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and slides buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material authentic.
The shaking and tsunami caused great power interruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but evacuateds still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo would visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami death rates increase over 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff from Donggala had arrived safely in Palu City, where workers in decks were sheltered in their office’s courtyard, they passed by at scenes of destruction, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they had seen many houses that were destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as assistance groups begin with the horrible task of launching the disaster lighting task, some people have complained that foreign assistants are prevented from traveling to Palu with a lot of experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and overseas staff can only start after the area of the disaster has been declared to national disaster area.
That has not happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at provinceal level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Okay, it's a national disaster," we can open it for international assistance, but it's not yet a status."
When the second evening arrived on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad history line of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a waste pipe.
Sunday rescue workers a woman was saved for two days under ruin was stuck with her mother's look next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian National Fallscreen Web team, disposed of two of the missing fallscreens for the Asian Games that had previously ended in Indonesia last month.
Other of those arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the fallscreen weaving field I had my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explains how, in the hours after the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media under the fallscreen tissue community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach celebration.
His messages, however, were answered only with one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think it means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during refilling of OTM by Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning at a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news statement from the Newport Police Department.
The car’s driver was doing empty an OTM in an entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, the detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press statement.
While he was busy, another man "from behind the Brink's-worker came down" and stole the bag money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects flying from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the inventor.
Anyone with information about their identity needs to contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Canye West: Faster change his name to Ye
Faster Canye West will change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote, "The beast previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has used the nickname Ye for some time and has used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where it is expected that he will announce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that canceled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
Besides the fact that it is a abbreviation of his current professional name, West has in the past said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has already finished with or without a link sign and uppercase.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use army against civilians
Mexican newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised to never use military power against civilians in the beginning of the country’s 50th anniversary of a bloody recompense against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never ever use the army to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot on October 2, 1968 on a peaceful demonstration in the place where up to 300 people died in a time when left-minded student movements took place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities attract youth to gangs.
U.S. must double AI funding
With China that becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US must double the amount that it spends on research in that field, investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even shortly the U.S.A. a complete formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced their plan last year: they aim to be the number 1 in innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The double of funding can double the chances that the next large AI performance will be achieved in the U.S.A., Lee said this week in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that knocked the highest approved American Othello player, and later he was an executive officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s robotics challenge and asked when the next one was going to be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government chairs, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporative," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influencers from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the US AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhDs in AI," he said.
China’s State Council issued their Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Ministry established a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at engaging partners from the industry and the academic world and the White House announced the formation of a Course Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire for months.
Macedonians agree with the choice or change the country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum about whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", action that would solve a decade-old distinguishing with Greece which blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, maintains that their Northern Neighbourland's name represents a demand in the area and refused their accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boikot campaign has put doubts about whether the coming will meet the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum voting letter reads: "Is you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue authorisation for Macedonia, one of the countries that have emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies like the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the paraply of the European Union, because it means safer lives for us all, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough parliamentary members have said that they will accept the result of the vote to decide it.
The change of name will require a second-third in the parliament.
The state’s electoral commission said there were no reports of dissatisfaction at 1 noon.
But then only 16 percent were then, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered electors voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a elector in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko express their voices for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name that will enable the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small elevation and attracted chairs before tents set up by those who are going to boikot the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor land, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
First Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the large majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after bringing out his voice.
He said a yes-out will be "a confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of electorates will participate in the referendum — less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote Sunday.
Of them 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, upcoming must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A return in the referendum will be the first serious return for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton Defense for Purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City’s 2-0 wins on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy during his purpose in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine heads received a defense at the center field.
He pursued between three Brighton defenders before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed by one defender before he crossed several others on the edge of the Brighton target gate.
Then he pushed a delight to the left, where he found for Sterling.
The English predictor used his first contact in the cage to return the ball for Aguero, which used his right foot to knock the Brighton target guard Mathew Ryan with a shot up to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about playing 55.60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We are happy that he signed a purpose at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga wrestling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
On that game, Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some contacts before he led Sterling to the farest corner.
The Sky Blues ’ predictor shot the ball in the net just before he was over the back line.
City takel Hoffenheim in Campioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play corruptor against Rockies
With the nationals who are out of the play battle, there is not much reason to force off another start.
But the ever-competing Scherzer wants to start the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play implications for the Rockies, which has one race-progress above the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least a promotor ceiling with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday evening, but still wanting to fix their first division title.
"Though we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of I will stare in the face this year.
Why would I not want to take part in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their beginning player for Sunday, but are reportedly favourable to make Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th, had a throw-training session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right handy is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outlets in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president directly referred to the situation around his Supreme Court election Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican entry at the middle - term elections.
"All we did is on the game in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetimes.
It's one of the big, big – I don't stand, but I'm actually standing and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happen now.
And they are now determined to take the power back by using any possible way, one sees the commonness, the genius.
They don't care for whom they hurt, for whom they have to walk in order to gain power and control; that is what they want, power and power, we will not give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "worn and common and narrow and false."
On the name, he referred to Senate’s judicial committee’s high - positioned Dianne Feinstein, who had received hardly bowed from the audience.
"Remember you her answer?
Did you let the document look out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I wait one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When momentum’s activists in my local party voted to put me under censur, it was not just a surprise.
After all, I am the last person in a string of Workersparty LP's who was told that we were not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatments because she resisted unhappyly against anti-semitism.
In my case, the movement of census criticized me because I was different from Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy differed from former leaders.
The Nottingham East Workersparty meeting announced Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, it was exactly what AR meetings on Friday were.
Unfortunately, today it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "friendlyer, more kind" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It became increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Worker Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views, began to expect me to make an U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a tired of discouragement on social media that asks me not being reselected, disappointment of politics from the core, and to tell me that I should not be in the Worker Party.
And that is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than my colleagues because the comments on me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day but never screw away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Worker party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of mistrust" or change of selection rules the party becomes more closer.
I have had a lot of advice in the last two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not being so pronounced and that I will then be "old".
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since I joined as a schooler at the Worker Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally left my state school deceived, I tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local council member or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my political positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who have advocated the motion on Friday, I can just say that with the country that sends to a Brexit that will harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Worker party.
But the only message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my electorates, whether their now members of the Worker Party are or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats to not become a rechosing or political advantage will prevent me from doing what I believe is in you all's best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have kicked the final outcome slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to victory in this wonderful- entertaining Tentent's Premiership game of the day.
They are now at the top of the point, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, who carried the home team and trainer Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested so far in our bets and we are still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ear to Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, intended by Frazier Clio, made Ayr before, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, which was made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot signed a unintentional three.
Climo increased Ayr's proximity with a punishment head, just before he, just before resting a solodry intended to make it resting time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, intended by Baggot, reduced the back to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that was carried on a portable, and from the start Ayr increased the proximity with a Stafford McDowall-drie, intended by Climo.
Ayr's perceptive captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and again Melrose used the extra player with an unintentional three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of many printing games.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he had killed for Clio without the ball, and from the penal line, MacPherson put the ball dead behind the coming Ayr-loose meal.
Climo purposed it, nest he had also done almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong’s goal head and flanked Gregor Henry away for the home team’s fifth three.
Still Game Star seems he's going to deal with a new career in restaurant industry
It seems that Still Game Star is going to move to the hospitality industry after discovered that he was appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in with old comedive noot Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the last of the program, and it seems that Kiernan will make ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would be involved in Glasgow's "blossoming restaurant industry".
'The sea is ours': the country surrounded Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific Ocean
Seafarers patrol a maswork-covered fleet quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Navy bases from Titicaca More to the Amazon are filled with the slogan: "The sea is rightly ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the country - surrounded Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline that they lost in a bloody resource conflict in Chile in the 19th century is still fresh — nests the need to rescue the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the international court on October 1, after five years of discussions.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peacefulness, and expects of course the result with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the IGH statement on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice in Den Haag will find in favour of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign door to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president — who faces a controversial struggle for rechoosing next year — also has many dependent on Monday’s judgment.
"We are near to return to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court in Bolivia will decide favor — and that few will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory, and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's judgment comes only six months after the last bets shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s matter, it may have slowed down in the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was bought by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morals ’ aggressive rhetoric tapped any remaining Chilean kindness, she indicated.
Bolivia and Chile will continue conversations at a time, but it would be very difficult to conduct harmful conversations.
The two countries exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in Den Haag, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was exceptionally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile and a chance to "end up to 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crown.
Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless their U.S. can trust.
North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarmament their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a consultation in Singapore between the leaders of the competition countries.
His comments follow to U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo evidently is on the edge to restart nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead point, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Young Un.
Ri says it's a "dream picture" that continued penalties and U.S. capture to a statement that ended the Korean War will also bring the North on its knees.
Washington is careful to agree with the statement without taking significant steps to disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second consultation.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about making a arsenal distinguishing that the country considers the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump discussion.
Paris fashion shows the latest series of large head covers on the way to the shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely turn off the sun, you do not need to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne announced a series of rogue large head covers at their SS19 collection on the walking board that encouraged the style at Paris Modeweek.
Extremely unpractical guards passed through this summer Instagram, and these designers paraded their surprising creatures on the walking board.
The exciter by Valentino was a great beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the models ’ heads.
Other large additions included water lemons decorated with jewels, a magic hat and even a pain apple – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also announced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had worked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than skin coutures.
One creature looked like a scuba equipment, including a snorkel and diving glass, while another looked like a melted ice crown.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Style watchers foretell that the huge guards may be on their way to the shops near you.
The overwhelming hat follows shortly on the hooks of 'La Bombah', the straw hat with a two-foot-wide edge that was seen on all's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractical hat that was spread over social, sent another large creation over the runboard – a straw-shore bag that was almost as large as the swimming broke-dressed model that weared it.
The brilliant orange raphya bag, finished with refinery and finishing a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Known stylis Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in shops for the next summer – since the designer has made such a great impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessive additionals.'
John Edward: Language skills vital to world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a ride of academic excellent performance, and it was continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which was only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community companies.
With over 30,000 schools throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independence School Council (SCIS), are pursuing the best level of service to their schools and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their schools for further and higher training, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable course in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot only rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the liga tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of school students who studied foreign languages had a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS’ 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students had a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also got an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as a professional choice, have the same reputation as the STEM (scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Committee on Vocational Affairs and Friends found in 2014 that some of the reasons that employees are trying to fill posts are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
With more likely jobs that require languages, these skills are vital in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and was French the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is so important now to invest in today’s children’s language education.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages that are considered essential for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarines or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from independenceal schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equipped children with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future will bring.
At this point, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still very important for the country’s future, so it must be reflected in education.
True, modern languages really need to be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
Il faut bee le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make Sunday debut for San Diego Lakers.
The guard is almost over for adherents to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers-advocate Luke Walton announced that James would play in San Diego in Sunday's late season opening game against the Denver Nuggets.
But just how many minutes he will play, he still needs to be determined.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell argued that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After a exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six contests in the early season program.
"I didn't need seasonal matches to come up at this stage in my career," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight a flat electoral convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five planned tracts next week, including stopping at friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote that is currently held back for his choice to fill the vacation in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the coming intersection because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voted in November.
How late is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight, and how do you look online?
Trump's compilation in Wheeling, West Virginia, was planned for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's trail in Western Virginia through a living stream below.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings to the nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become excited about accusations of sexual abuse with a expected confirmation voice that has been retained for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main view of these overwhelming things is to help the Republicans who are facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that the next week's five tracts were aimed at "to visit volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Management of the Congress is so critical for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," said a spokesman of the Trump campaign, who refused his name, to Reuters.
This evening, arranged for the Westbanco-Area in Wheeling, can draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginian Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, which is behind the voice patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a hoping at the voting bus," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryderbeker 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have courage for the fight to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday’s single game
After three unilateral sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder beker needed.
The swinging swing of momentum is a total conceived sports concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and definitely in competitions like those.
Where would they then say that the momentum is now?
"They have walked by six points and now it is four, so we carry it as a little momentum, I am counting," said Jordan Spieth when he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points before and twelve played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not at least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and signed each three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the swimming field and leads through his example.
That scout of celebrations became harder as she progressed around and he sank a critical sethold to win four totally equally while he and Thomas were with two rounds behind.
His setkeep that won the race at 15 for them was greeted with a similar shout, the kind that says to a man that he believes that the American team has another chance.
"You really have to pick out everything and worry about your own bet," said Spieth.
That's all those players have left now.
18 bullets to print their stamp.
The only players who have more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncertain story of the Ryder Beker.
Europe’s unmarried but charming couple had four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hold one on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one hold on Saturday morning as well as during the back nine Friday morning.
That loop, and the way their energy seems to be flowing after and from this extinct crowd, confirm that they are the players who have to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can clear a potential European victory when the sun over the Le Golf National pocket.
Choose both at the same time or at different pockets.
However, it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short records with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One keeps over track number and two doubles on the front nine made the Spanier and the Sweed land in a hole from which they couldn't even even come from.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four balls and four-game teams are so exciting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can turn into a point of view.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and has taken significantly the lead in the last day, but this four-playing session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage for the struggle to which some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs for 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder-beker
Europe will have a healthy benefit on the last day of the Ryder beaker after they have come from Saturday's four-ball and four-play games with a prompt of 10-6.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories on a difficult Tiger Woods to take their scores as far as Le Golf National was concerned.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to keep the trophys that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team who had unevenly prested in the morning’s four balls, so that they won the series 3-1.
The U.S.A. experienced more resistance in the four games and won two bettings, but they did not make the defence shrink.
Jim Furike’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single gambling games to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European new one who won four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second couple in the history of the Ryderbeker who signed four points after their first four races.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they played excellently together to conquer a dad Woods and American newling Bryson Dechambreau with a even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two bets on Saturday, sometimes showed glamour of brilliance, but he now lost 19 of his 29 bets in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning’s four balls, returned to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 bottom for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka - which is first and third on the world’s rank.
Europe, however, did not always get their sense on a pleasant day with a little wind southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won three times a great tournament, and Justin Thomas put the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to knock Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four games after they lost the first two puppets.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder-beaker has a team recovered from a disadvantage of four points when they enter the single game, even though Furich's team just needs to play equal to keep the trophy because they already keep it.
However, after two days of being second, they do not seem to be able to accomplish an attack on Sunday.
North Korea says they're not going to 'decisive' unilaterally disarmament without confidence.
North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations on Saturday that continued penalties worsened their distrust from the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Body's Annual General Assembly that in the last year, North Korea has taken "significant welwill measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test area and promised not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We see no corresponding response from the U.S.A.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the US there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not defend ourselves onesidedly first."
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons that would be rewarded if it did gradually steps, his words seemed meaningful because it did not unconditionally reject the unilateral removal of nuclear weapons as Punggang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the U.S. and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore when Kim did work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongang first had to give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to slow down strict international penalties against North Korea.
"The U.S.A. insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by strengthening the level of the penalties to achieve their goal in a compulsory way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The persecution that penalties can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued penalties make our mistrust worse."
Ri didn't say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader had raised attention at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings during the last five months between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party was in this issue about the destruction of nuclear weapons South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead point."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was indispensable that North Korea's fire arrows would be directed to the U.S. land mass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump for Kim called a "fire pillar" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to destroy North Korea "in general," Kim praised abundantly for his courage because he had taken steps to disarmament, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that penalties still need to stay there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timework for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council Pungghang must reward for the steps they have taken.
But, U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, said on Thursday to the United Nations Security Council, "Application of penalties by the Security Council must continue zealously and without stop until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously reinforced penalties against North Korea in an effort to dry funding for Pjongang's nuclear and ballistic mission programs.
Pompeo met Ri in the outskirts of the United Nations General Assembly and afterwards said that he would visit Pungghang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea this year three times, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Punggang in July and said that progress was made, but North Korea accused him of setting "bendelike demands" only hours later.
In a meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to break down a missile station and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "conform measures".
He said that Kim told him that the "conform measures" he wanted to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalisation of relationship with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course about enough rest.
A new course at the Harvard University this year lets all his pre-graduate students get more sleep in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of study by anticipating coffee-driven 'helenagsessions'.
A academic has found that students at the world’s top university are often inadequate when it comes to the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at the Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at the Brigham and Women Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the U.S.A.
He was inspired to start the course after having made a talk about the effect of sleeping on learning.
'At the end of it one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me it first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important sleep is--what surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which was first offered that year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletics performance, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at the Harvard Medical Faculty and Executive Director of the University’s Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were seriously taken sleep during the week.
The hourly course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a sleeping room, where students on coffee cupboards, gardins, exercise shoes and books must click to be told about the impact of coffee and light and how athletics performance is affected by sleep deficiency and the importance of a sleep period.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleeping can increase risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourage participants to remember their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know-- just as you have the right to know what the health effect is of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to study 'health' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant sleeping is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 's secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said-- even to avoid it to put weight on, because sleeping puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old California studying chemical and physical biology, helped professor Czeisler to design the course after last year, during his first year at Harvard, one of his classes.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof. Czeisler recommended students to consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' that is radiated by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disturb your circudical rhythms and can lead you to struggling to get to the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Purpose of Menga conquered Gerrard’s men
Rangers experienced another scarce away day's heart when Dolly Menga's goal head Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team brought down a layer of 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win them first as visitors since February's 4-1-sixe at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 bets as drivers so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran for hands in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga smote seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on target difference.
And there can be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object seemed to have been thrown away from the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr to the final battle of the Betfred-becher.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that last week took a point of Hearts and he would have been in his nipples with the way his well-trained team murdered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated balbesite, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
Actually, after just two minutes, they had to sign scores when Menga’s first deployment transmitted Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s purpose, but the middle - field player opened his great chance.
A deep release by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could just kick away at the back of the target.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to have a punishment target at the quarterly point when he and Steven Lawless fought, but the divorce judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was hardly plagued by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and a comfortable target head of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s openmaker may have been against the direction of game at the 34th minute, no one can deny that they deserve it, even though it is only for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had a nearly immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly from his line to the block.
However, Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed with Lithgow and Halkett who palmed long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their proximity in the last stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come wide from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a punishment head when he broke with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE TELE... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger teller has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of support in popculture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man, "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can even hear the effects of the atoms produced by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans, "Good, it's breaking around now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention wearing his name lives.
New cancer agents can learn the immune system to 'see' robbers cells
New cancer agents can learn the immune system to 'see' and kill robbers cells
Ingredients learn immune system to identify rover cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, change in a laboratory
They can see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, learning the immune system to identify robbers cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing it into the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2 and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promised vaccine."
HER2 "drive the growth of several kinds of cancer," including breast-, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and to "learn them" how to attack cancer cells worked to knock a kind of leukaemia.
Canye West began after his action on SNL with a pro-Trump spotter, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Canye West was evacuated in the studio during a Saturday night live after an outdated action in which he believed the U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would be preferable in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, where he had a Make America Great-pet, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I'm talking so often to a white man and they're, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racial?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed with Brett Kavanaugh's evidence before the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent out, the pictures of West’s shout were loaded by comediant Chris Rock on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to ridiculate for West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made hard for him behind the podium about what he had carried on his head.
"They bowled me behind the podium.
They said, 'Get a little out with that hat on.'
They bowled me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went before, "Will you see the low place?" and said that he would dress his "superman's mantle, because this means that you can't tell me what I should do. Would you like the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comment attracted at least twice a yoke from the audience and members of the SNL rolling division seemed embarrassed, reported Variety, with one person there who said to the publication, "The whole studio has become silent."
West was brought in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rim dresser Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West had been very surprised with the execution of the song I Love it, dressed like a perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the TPUSA Conservation Group, Candace Turner, who whitled: "On one of the most courageous spirits: DANCIAT YOU WORK THINK THE SHIPS."
But chat program ma'am Karen Hunter betted that West was just "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art") I believe accepting an ideology and preaching that threatens my society.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhymcletzer on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature known earlier as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who changed his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg, Mede-Rom-Climber, had the name Snoop Lion, and of course violent musical-looking Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist known earlier as Prince.

It is expected that the prosecutor will appear before the Belfast Landdroshof on Monday.
The accusation will be reviewed by the public accusation service.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington criticizes toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his sword - swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy championship Game of Thrones.
But the player, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic male in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels 'reasonably strong' about doing some of this issue.
'I feel personally quite strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with maleness?' he said.
"What did our men learn as they grew up with regard to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be responsible for the growth in toxic male because of its extremely male characters.
He went on, "What is inborn and what has been taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time--how do we change it?
Because something evidently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not take part in any of the Game or Thrones' successives and follow-up pieces when the series next summer ends, for he says he is 'finished with battlefields and horses'.
From November on, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a movie manufacturer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-crowned fantasy reeks.
In June 2018, the couple married on the site of Leslie’s family land in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that there was a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which represents a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who experienced HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 10,000 people.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical matter in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the transfers of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to work the matter.
Maxine Waters denyed that a staff member of GOP-senators' data had eliminated, condemned 'hazardous lies' and 'controversial theory'
The U.S. Republican Maxine Waters defeated Saturday against claims that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican American senators on the lawyers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations were driven by "ultra-righteous" experts and web sites.
"Luys, lies, and yet disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The selected information was reported to include the home addresses and telephone numbers for US Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday online, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's trial on the claims of sexual abuse against the nominated to the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the sites related to Waters’ office and disclosed the information of a member of the Waters staff, reported the Hill.
"This unjustified claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff--who's identity, personal information and security were jeopardized because of this fraudulent and false claim--was not at all responsible for the interpretation of this information.
This unjustified claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement soon led to criticism online, including former Whitehouse Pers Representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial witnesses of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It indicates that she did not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ response to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seemingly being too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was trying to light Waters in the intersection from the kissings, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it is true," he whitled.
In her statement, Waters said that her office "notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies of these fraudulent claims.
"We'll make sure that the managers are turned off," she continued, "and that they'll be legally responsible for everything they do which is destructible and dangerous for every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - fool Rowan Atkinson spy spottery
It is now traditional to search for Brexit meaning in any new movie with a British impact and it seems to apply to this releaving of the Johnny English action comedie spottery franchise - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-choosing evenatriate about the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new export event?
In any case, the unholpet Johnny English with his peullows and rubber face had made his license to waste everything up for the second time--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he was a great comic creation for non-English-speaking movie hearers.
Of course, he is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of mysteries, which leaves chaos behind him, who at once played Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two cute moments in this latest version of YOUR.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter as he was dressed in a medieval pantserwear and the screw sheets shortly cut against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown but the humor feels quite flawful and weirdly excessive, especially when the "serious" film trade marks such as 007 and Mission Impossible are now using itself comedy with self-confidentiality as an ingredient.
The humor feels that it is focused on children rather than on adults, and for me Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent movies in the persons of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cubic cracker infiltrated Britain's super secret network of spys and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the disturbance of the agent in service - a sad little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last strait for a first minister who is a blowed and occupied character, who already experiences a complete collapse of political unwillingness: Emma Thomspson does her extreme best with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's only little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since each active spy is endangered, she must call someone out of his retirement.
And this means the struggling Johnny English himself, now serving as a teacher at some decent institution, but what from the record gives lessons about how to be a secret agent, there are some nice jokes here when English offers a school or rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency command and is reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a diving boat commander, a all-map-pix-roll in which too little is expected from Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus the Batman and Robin are to waste everything completely in Her Majesty’s secret service completely again in service and come down to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the dangerous enthusiasm of the charismatic technology milliard that claims that he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey of ridiculous eskapades: mutilated as cherries they burn a French restaurant, cause chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury hunting; and English let pure anarchie break when he trys to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is saved, but as cute and excessive as it may be, the entire record is quite like child TV.
Reasonably medium.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to his right?
Work denies a plan for British to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to be paid for a four-day week work--but for five days.
The party claims that company base savings caused by the artificial (KI) revolution should be transmitted to workers by giving them extra day.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day week, but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that the party's economic agenda and plans to set the country in favour of the workers will 'pass'.
To change to a four-day week was signed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to use the changing economy.
A senior Workersparty source said to The Sunday Times: 'A policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker as well as the parti's overall industrial strategy.
The Worker Party will not be the first to sign such an idea, with the Green Party who promised a four-day week during his campaign for the general election in 2017.
However, the ambition is currently not signed by the whole Worker Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: 'A four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not considered by the party'.
Shadow minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to wake out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from 'sightless directors' and 'winners' back to service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire investment, since a worker's government can make 'deductions' on the basis of suspected infringement.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on directions from companies and to create inclusive ownership funds to provide 10 percent of equivalence in businesses in the private sector to employees, which can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their opinions.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week and raised the question whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent out on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could deepen anything that they could make their opinions change.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done it?
He was determined, definitely, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett has zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who she called couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I see nothing new change."
What is the World Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be the host for the World Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an even impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizen Festival is now in his seventh year, and during the celebration, tens of thousands of people will flow to Central Park’s Great Law not only to enjoy actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to create awareness for the real purpose of the opportunity to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international talk group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP card), concerters had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to create awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen at 12 years of age left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivisime" people who feel that they make a real difference by signing a online petition or sending a twitter?
Since 2011, Worldburger says it has recorded over 19 million "actions" of his supporters, which support a variety of different goals.
It says that these actions helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion that might affect the lives of over $2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the fixed money has hitherto had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based company of investors and implementers who are committed to "helping children to reach their full potential," and promises to give $35 million to help end infants in the country after they have received more than 4,700 twitters from World Citizens.
"With support from the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutration a footnote in history," said the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a concert in London to the crowd.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to approach the UK to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children with nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the general questions on his website that ask, "What makes you think our extreme poverty can end?"
"It will be a long and hard road--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-participation movements before us, we will be successful because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who act in New York at this year's event, which will be offered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S.A. can use fleet for "blockades" to prevent the export of Russian energy - minister of domestic affairs
"If needed" Washington could leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from landing in the market, including in the Middle East, the US Minister of Inland Affairs revealed Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works on the invitation of the legal government - is an advantage of investigating new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as makers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the southern Europe," he said.
And, according to an official, there are ways and means to take it up.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy did not land on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the attendants of an event offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profits that viewed themselves as the "vote of the energy consumer" in the U.S.A.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to the management of Russia and Iran and noticed that this was practically the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said while he referred to Russia as a "single talent" with a economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements come, as Trump administration was on a mission to give the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a surplus to replace Russia, at far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including American President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unadapted" Nord Stream 2-pipe project, which, according to Trump Berlyn Moscow's "catched".
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2-pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington’s fiery opposition of the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy could not be a means of performing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in September.
The U.S. opinion led to the opposition from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s prominent industry organisation, the Federal of German Industry (BDI) called on the US to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Canselier Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will consider it "serious" to stand as president in 2020, said the senator of Massachusetts.
Massachusetts' senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she'd consider it seriously to stand as president after the middle-term elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider it to stand.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our breaking government and it includes a woman on the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November I'll consider it seriously to stand for President."
Warren aired her opinion on President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said he "take the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm up to my inner concern about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very pronounced in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
In a twin Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before our vote."
A survey released Thursday showed that most of Warren's own choosers do not think she should stand in 2020.
Eight and fifty percent of "probable" Massachusetts-choosers said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University of Political Research Centre/Boston Globe recording.
Two and thirty percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick had to stand, with 38 percent who supported the idea that he had to stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high profile- Democratic names discussed to possibly stand in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont's senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump Congress
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September.
He was arrested Monday night and accused of an incident of domestic violence.
"What goes through my own son, which he went through since he returned, I felt sympathy with other families that felt the consequences of PTSV and the injury with which our soldiers returned," she said to an audience during a convention to Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little else, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their soldiers and Air Forces have given, and any other member of the army for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence, assault of a woman, interference with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
18 states and the Columbia District support a legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or household violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a friend of the court jurisdiction in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the claimer in the Grace v. Sessions issue submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not made public.
She says her mate "and his violent gang members sons," she mistreated, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was held in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who are proposing a large number of U.S. asylum applicants, as nations who face deep problems with gangs and household violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigration Appeals) which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents that fled from domestic violence.
The district of Columbia's lawyer General Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require all asylum applications to be determined on the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-Justice jurisdiction.
Advocates further argued in the legal order that the policy that refuses immigrants harms the US economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "will provide necessary work."
In June, lawyer Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer allow asylum to victims flying because of domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their native country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to ease all problems — not even all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Hopeful Rescue efforts in Palu while deaths double in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly stirring.
"It feels very excited," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her fevery baby son at a removal centre in the devastating city of Palu.
"Every minute brings a ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants were seen where they returned to their devastated homes, searching for throughdrawn possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 range of shaking, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong afterchocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells about the violent earthquake that shook the fifth floor hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I'm impressed in the walls' ruins, I think," Haris said to Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'fucking' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador of China Peking accused of the American press being used to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily’s paid insertion in the Des Moines Register – the state Iowa’s newspaper with most sales – after accusing China to interfere with the US Congress elections of 6 November, a complaint that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections, noticed what U.S. officials said to Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington is to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an escalating trade war that led to the equivalence of their tariff rounds on each other’s imports.
China’s recompensation rates early in the trade war were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and U.S. scholars.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "which now worsens the mob by publishing propaganda advertising in our own free press."
"By the spread of their propaganda, the Chinese government grabs America's loved tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing you will find very limited deviating voices and do not see any real reflection of the varied opinions that the Chinese people have about China's alarming economic track, given that media are under the firm inch of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers scraped away from the offer to publish his article," although he did not say what newspaper.
Republicans distinguish women's electors before inter-choices with Kavanaugh debakel, warn analysts
While many top republics stand at the Supreme Court-genomised Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of several claims of sexual assault, analysts warned that during the coming intermediate elections they will see counterreaction, especially of women.
The emotions about this go enormously high, and most Republicans are recording that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor in political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s inquiry for an FBI investigation on the little little would be enough to punish wrathful electors.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national speaker to the progressive MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.-courant.
On Friday morning, protesters "November is on the way!" thrust as they argued in the entrance hall of the Senate, while the Republicans who chose the Judge Committee to continue Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"Men say it was already high; that's true.
But it can be higher, especially among swing-woman electors in the forest cities and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public evidence that explains the details of her accusation of sexual assault against the High Court of Justice, analysts said that an opposition can follow if Republicans continue to confirm.
"It became a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice and whether Kavanaugh is placed on the court, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities United States, a group who helps to elect Democrats to the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with a little more that chooses the side of the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 say they believe Kavanaugh definitely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said that they think Kavanaugh was likely or definitely joking during his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s call, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complaint, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate's Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her at 17 years of age while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-nominated his gender parts to her as they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new internet to say the fight to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, launches a start-up occupation trying to interact with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project, Inruption, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed that the idea with Inruption is "world-dominance".
"We must do it now," he said about the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "Personal Online Data Storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, todo lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional resources.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is fully available to the user who can obtain access to that type of information.
The company calls it "Personal Authorisation by Data."
The idea of Inruption, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, developers of the staff contracted to work on the project and a community of voluntary codingers.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrup website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about the announcement of a complete change, where all their business models are completely turned around overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a posting on Medium that was published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruption's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the Worldwide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee had a powerful voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he starts in an interruption, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Worldwide Web-Konsortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am greatly optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross spiritual celebrations
The only clergy of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored 100 years later in his home town.
Lt. Kol honor Bernard Vann acquired the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sharp shooter and never knew that he had acquired the highest British military honor.
A Memorial stone was revealed on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilljant symbolic" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned performance.
According to the London Gazette, from 29 September 1918, its bataljon led over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through many dense mist and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
Later he hurried to the fireline and led the line forward with the "greatest courage" before he stormed a man-only a field gun and knocked out three of the department.
Lt. Kol Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on October 4, 1918 – just more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action is "a thing I know I can never stand, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a rock to the parades, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orkes.
Michael Vann said, "he felt honored to play a role in the parades," and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the follow - up Bellator 206, just not to see the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be sent directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to say the battle, watchers in the UK were stupid when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were impressed after staying alert to the early hours specially for the battle.
One supporter on Twitter described the conversion to the child chart as "one or other sick joke."
"It is governmental regulation that the content was not suitable at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior Vice-President of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they'd work on their schedule to include VK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the re-send, I think we can probably work out something," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we'll not be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But our work on it.
Believe me, when it turned over, there were many SMSs sent every time and again, and not all of them were kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five struggles instead of six — as we normally make — and we have tried to offer more to our followers and just go over our time.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'minimum' about sexuality
Olympic dyker Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of minority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old he didn't know before he went to high school that "not all are like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he threw his feelings about gay rights to give others "hop".
He also said that to become a parent had made him less care about winning at the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, ended a few months because of disease.
When he appeared as a rejector on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "minder" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings were less than, and otherwise feel, the true things that gave me the power and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so he disappointed no one when they would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner became a high-profile LGBT struggler and used his appearance at this year's state bond games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he aired his feelings because he's so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give others hope.
The three-month world champion said that to get in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013 – "caught him in opposition."
Daley was married to the Oscar winner last year, which is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a matter.
"When you endure so much at such a young age" – he went to his first Olympic Games at 14 years of age and his father died in cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and lowpoints.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says she had changed "all perspective".
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a golden medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic golden medals.
My Olympic Golden Medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked if they had tickets for London 2012 — for he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him" you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he quit breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not inevitable," he said.
The following year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed about my life for a long time -- to dive before my homes at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song champion — Proud by Heather Small — who also revolved with him in the construction of the Olympic Games and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson doesn't drive and get back at Saturday's Ryder Beaker
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th Ryder fight, but he'll have to make his shape to prevent it from being a unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record-12th time in the two-year event, was withdrawn by Captain Jim Fureich for Saturday's four-ball games and four-quarters.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-month Major winner will divide his day between it to be racial owner and on the exercise bomb work on his game in the hope of correcting that difference.
Even at the peak of his career, he was never the straightest driver, and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long rufield always punishes the miserable vessels.
And as if the job on its own is not challenging enough, Mickelson comes to his ninth bet against the exact British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who worked together with newling Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their bets this week.
If the Americans, which are four points behind, start the 12 single game games well, Mickelson’s game may be absolutely vital.
Furich expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role he had today, gave me a knock on the back, and put his arm around me, and said he would be right tomorrow," said Furich.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hero’s Hall, and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine that he would play two bets.
I put more in the prospect, but that is how things worked out and that is what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the job, just as anyone else."
Mickelson will be more than Sunday Nick Faldo’s record for the player who has played most Ryderbekkamps.
It can mark the end of a Ryder beaker course that never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven halfs, although Furich said that his presence contributed invisible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, like shaving the crazy, and he's a wonderful boy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him crazy, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just game."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advance can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the last day's single game in Ryderbeker can easily change into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danes made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seven Ballesteros had a five-point prompt, but only nail scrap won with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advance at Valderrama; we had a great advance at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won a nail," said Bjorn, on the photo, after watching how the class won Friday 2018 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 before was at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You're going to be drunk tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the scores on the board.
We have a purpose, and it's trying to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I still say, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are also well aware of who stands on the other side – the best players in the world."
Happy about how his players fare on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds, "I will never walk things forward with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it is the individual participation that comes in turn, and it is a horse of a different color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you are individually there, you're tested to your full capacity as a golf player.
This is the message you have to transmit to players find the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate, and he must also find the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his equine Jim Furijk would like his players to be better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points from four.
Furich himself has been emigrated on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the wish pane at Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe got the "wonderful work of Medinah".
"I remember every diluting word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, spoke courageously to his players on the way to that last day.
"We have 12 important bets tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as it was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medinah.
When that moment begins to go in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle bets.
We set up our team accordingly, and divided the men that we felt, you know, to bring us something magic tomorrow."
Thomas received the task of trying to lead the opposition and came in the main fight against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I chose this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it to the end," said Bjorn about his single game options.
Germany’s New Warship Exposed
The German army's latest fregat would have been put in service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War-era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to wrong systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The use of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the headship of the splinternau Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Time-Curant quoting a military speaker.
This vessel must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the distressing post-production issues plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered the Navy in 2007 will replace the ancient Bremen class fregates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful canon, a battle order of airwear and anti-ship missions as well as a number of secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to develop the latest fregates for up to two years away from home ports.
Continuous delays, however, mean that the advanced warships — evidently capable of projecting power overseas — will already become obsolete at the time they enter into service call the Time.
The disastrous F125 fregate made up last year when the German Navy officially refused to employ the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss-skeepsyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder.
Few are known about the reasons for the return, but German media called that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is encountered in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the male force on older Bremen class fregates.
It also found that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing the performance and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are probably twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides the wrong hardware, the price label for the entire project — including the training of the crew — also affected a matter.
It evidently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that have beaten the new fregates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the force of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet's "ships that can be expelled are touching."
In time, the official said that the issue worsened, for old ships were put out of service, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He laughed that no one of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Fleermice’s Secret Life
New research is carried out on a landstock in the Scottish High Countries that aims to reveal how flager mice use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will throw new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow both the ordinary and soprano wing mice and the brown long ear and Daubenton wing mice at Invereve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on important locations on the property to search for battle - mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile recordings using manual indicators.
Expert-clan channels of all recordings will check the regularity of the flager-mice calls and determine what kinds are doing.
A Habitat card and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the areas of the habitat for the flager mice the most important and how it is used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to best manage forestlands for flager mice and other associated species.
Flear Mouse populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have decreased significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping place and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as attacks by home cats.
Flear mice are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ovarian orientation technique to show gaggans and obstacles on their flight routes.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about wing mice.
It has ten trained experts who regularly carry out recordings and sleep inspections and sometimes perform salvation.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated flager mill reserve at Threave landgoed in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland’s ten flager wing species.
Landlord David Thompson says that the property is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for flager mice," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there are so many about flager mice that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He emphasizes the necessity of seeking for flager mice before maintaining property because it is possible that unconscious destruction of a single crushing place may mean up to 400 females and boys' death and can eradicate a whole local population.
Flear mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flager mice and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo kills rape assaults while lawyers prepare to declare German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo defeated rape assaults against him as "false news" and said that people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to report the German news magazine, Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus prosecutor was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel.
He said that when he paid her $375,000 to stay quiet about the incidence, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he spoke to his 142 million followers, published hours after the claims, Ronaldo, 33, dropped the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-month Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything's right," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to declare Der Spiegel about the claim, which they, according to Reuters, called "inadmissible reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy".
An attorney Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for " moral damage compensation for any amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The claimed insident was claimed to take place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player’s room, where he was supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the claimed incidence and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" that was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a arbitration outside the court because she was "angry for revenge" and worried about being "openably humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the order now because she has still been traumatized by the claimed incidence.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the assault claimed, and this summer, in a $100 million agreement, moved to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will lose 'forever repentance' if their car manufacturers
The UK 'will repent forever' if they lose their status as a world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is "unfortunate" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would have to stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-agreement brexit, could cost posts.
The Burnaston plant — which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis — produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnaston.
Other UK motor manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have aired fears to leave the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said that they would close their mini plant in Oxford for a month to Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "net-time" basis, with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there may be disruption at the border that the industry may say lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those controls at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the current success but to us to grab this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we have absolutely needed to continue with what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped but warned that added costs could reduce the construction’s competitiveness in the long term and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and the Unite Union's conciliator on the construction, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back again.
A spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Whitehouse
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Advocate General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed "with another week" while the struggle on the general court of Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervising the work of special law advisor Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian electoral intervention, links between Trump helpers and Russia and possible transmissibility of the law by the President.
Whether Trump goes off the advocate-General or not, and it threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's gorgeous stories have fought for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of having a recorder to talk with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of reports that he was on his way to thank.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to thank" for Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Court's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump had a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote further postponed.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for it is not yet determined, it can be this week, I can see that it is postponed with another week with all the other things going on with the High Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders have not held a Whitehouse press information session since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarceness of information sessions is not because of a disgusting mind for TV journalists who are "effectively hunting", although she said, "I won't fight with the fact that they are effectively hunted."
She then indicated that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence, "We have looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States questions, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this much and you've seen us do much in the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignity desks.
Solo press declarations are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbundled and sometimes, bizarre appearance before journalists who were there together.
Secretary for Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and to express their wish to stay to Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months before the UK was withdrawn from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed them to cover the costs of deployed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government also intensified their preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know it is for all of you a very distressing time.
That is why I want to repeat how much I prize each staff member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and further bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit from the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after main injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he had a head injury in Saturday 31-27 defeated against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team’s Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State’s chief coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before resting.
"He came to the margin and kind of just dropped up there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the edge before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/range of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, he killed five times before leaving the game, which totally faced his season on 18 dead vessels.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's effort to draw young choosers
The seal tax will be raised on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Thesourie expects to collect up to £120 million a year — to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK — with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless ones, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an effort to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s effort to move young electorates with promises to provide more affordable housing and to target high service providers.
The seal tax increase will be raised to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to combat homelessness.
Aside from the current seal tax, including the higher levels set two years ago on second homes and houses purchased for rent, can be up to three percent.
The Thesourie expects that this move can bring up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of the newly built London property is purchased by non-UK citizens who raise the prices and make it more difficult for first buyers to get a foot in the house door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "spook villages" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people possess their first home.
He accused large building firms of keeping their property prices high by raising land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs May to dispose of quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain's "house disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a prominent series of planned housing improvements, including lease management and an end to "no error-expositions".
He also wants to give wheels greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I would devote my Prime Ministership to restoring the British dream – that life must be better for every new generation.
And this means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it cannot be right that it is just as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as well as foreign - based companies to buy homes as for hard - working British inhabitants.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a deep dream, and the humiliation of homelessness has become a too great reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to manage Scotland."
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at a time.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life in the North-East team, which is currently in the third place in League One, three points below the tops.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Ministership last season.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but it was already," said Ross to BBC Scotland’s Sports sound.
"But as a child I often looked with my father for Scotland at Hampden and it's something that pulls me back.
But the opportunity can only come if I'm successful in club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic-master said he felt no anxiety to imitate such established names at such a large club, after he had previously rejected presentations of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"On the moment, success will be measured for me by ''Can I let this club return to the Prime League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly in the Prime League," he said.
"It's not a easy job to get it there, but I'll probably just view myself as successful if I can get the club out there again."
Ross' career in the management is only for three years, after a period of assistant officer at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third liga and converted St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his play course at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroad," he said when he remembered how he took over Alloa's leads.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bizar, because I've done good enough, made a reasonable existence of it and experienced reasonable peaks.
But the game may be difficult.
There are many things for which one must come weekly.
I continue to do this with regard to the stress and pressure of the work, but driving feels just right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable thing I was in my own skin throughout my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, found recording
The summer heating wave improved Britain’s tragic crowies ’ income, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bridge groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July — but receptions in restaurants were decreased by 4.8 percent, showing figures.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy company CGA, who composed the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Becker meant that Julie followed a pattern similar to the previous month, June, when drinking places were up with 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were even more severely hit.
The decrease of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-lined drinking places and crows have done far better and increased more than restaurants have fallen.
Food-directed drinking sites also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Overall managed cows and drinking sites increased sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food was dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreational and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the tendency we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of large social or sport events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-the-house-out market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent year by year would be particularly difficult above and except constant cost pressure.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-directed operators and just the time will show if the more moderate temperature we experienced since August will bring the necessary relief."
Total growth in sales throughout drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trademark declarations.
The Coffer Peach Tracker business sales monitor for the UK's drinking site, bridge and restaurant sector gathers and analyses performance data from 47 business groups, with a collective turnover of more than £9 billion and is the established standard in the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One out of five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers reveal a survey
Recording of 20 000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The News Elevated Fears That Sexual Contents Is Placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the Instagram Photopart.
The news raised fears that sexual content is placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show parents, but also have private accounts.
One mother who came to her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who urged others to " rape her."
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them who acknowledge that they have private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "vote for athletes" at the Scottish Sports Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scotish athletics as a non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated job and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie has described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and the world athletics community and we are surely athletics in Scotland will benefit much from what she brings to the advice," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four golden Olympic Medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after having had a short-term ischemical attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only the time would learn if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhaustive work, but fully recovered, learned how to walk again, and doing ability exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Bore pad vision that moms compare with cows divided online opinions
A breast-feeding company shared online with an advertising that compared breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
To celebrate the launch of what is called the "world's first silent silent breast pump," Consumer Technology Company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choosing music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to moms that dairy.
Four right mothers dance in a shoe full of straw and cows on the size of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail," and "If you haven't seen it, it's not odors, it's my breasts."
The choir section says, "Damp it out, pump it out, I carry the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertising published on the company's Facebook sheet caused online controversial.
With 77,000 looks and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reaction from viewers, with many who say that it interferes with the "worsts" of the pollen industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Nes we must become pregnant and give them birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of birth," wrote one.
The Elvie breast pump fits discrete in a nutrition bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person noticed, "Reasonably traumatic to mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Somebody else added, "The ad is so out of feeling."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "crying naked".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had still breastfeeded.
To milk out made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another person noticed, "It's a nice advertisement directed to mothers that are milking out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows".
It is not an advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discrete pump in their bra's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreet in a nutrition brake that gives women the freedom to move, to hold their babies, and even to go out while they milk out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother said, "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a great and attractive announcement.
By dragging a parallel between women that were milking and dairy cows, we wanted to place the dairy process and all the challenges of it in the high light, while in an entertaining way where people can find connection the wonderful feeling of freedom that will bring the new pump.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump got the news.
During London Modeweek, a mother of two appeared on the walking board for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant girls moved silently to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of persistent migrants has risen sharply, although monthly border transitions have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to strong retoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children at ceiling.
Traditionally, most ceilings were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country is endangered by stepping forward to demanding a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible deposits and other mature members of their households should go their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and customs enforcement before the Congress, testified that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied for the guarantee of uncommitted minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"At almost 80 percent of the individuals who are citizens or household members of citizens are illegal here in the country and a large amount of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to deal with the children faster, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to protective workers.
Many will appear through video conference calls, rather than in personal, to ask their case for legal status to a immigration judge.
Those inappropriate for emergency aid will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain in prison, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape efforts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say that concerns are increased at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling to be more easily seen as a result of the size.
They added that moving the children to the town of tent without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say goodbye to friends, can worse the trauma that many already have trouble.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupational forces’ to withdraw immediately
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is in his eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Advocate Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian ground, under the predecession of fighting terrorism and will be "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, with more millions who were rooted, "amper over."
He said that Damascus would continue "to carry this sacred battle until we cleaned all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States trained and advised about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly against Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - disturbed country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for their "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We made an appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to familiarize these returnes," he said.
"They politics something that should be just a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomas said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last large rebel settlement of Idlib, created an opportunity to continue with political conversations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, emphasized that the agreement had "decisive sperms" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front that would be "eliminated".
UN Agent, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and to build the path to elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to "the examination of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-selection in 2020, unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals end his presidentship early.
In what, without doubt, "the most dramatic final of a presidency will ever be!"
Until now there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak rates have doubled up to 1.05 million at CCN and almost threedobled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak-time viewers, on 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top cable viewers with more than 3.5 million viewers on large news evenings.
"It's a fire to which people are dressed, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedie writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "For he lets me laugh," said Scovell to me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on the TV, the stories from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families, and the health of the world economy.
Disable is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet, it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of it to see how a panel of experts debates Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 voltress-learning flight baad ("a cloth thick of the hubris," said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I would never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Parts he does what makes it feel like a reality program is that he feeds you something every evening," said Brent Montgomery, business head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's alternating role distribution and daily kink in the plot (such as to seek disputes with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you stay behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was watching MSNBC inside while he took CNN.
He couldn’t screw him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh being on the way to appear before the Senate’s Court and the future of the High Court hanging in the scale.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs then and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of the Western civilization,' Mr. Fleiss said to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Outdoors flow to the most exciting mid-term selection race in Home
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees a flood of money, thanks to a shift of congress districts that have now made two officials landing in a race around the same seat.
The recently changed front-strand Pittsburg district lets Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measure forces.
Lamb stands against another official carrier, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is severely overwhelmed with the new 17th.
The cards were revoked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally decreed in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign funding competition between the big parties’ financial legs, the Democratic Field Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Field Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nail-crape win in a wide-looking special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
US thought to penalize El Salvador rather than to support China, but then returned
Diplomaes noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until friends exiled the Trump Organization's management team.
Officers of the State Departments decided to revoke the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the "independent decisions not to admit Taiwan anymore," Heather Nauert, the department’s spokesman, said earlier this month in a statement.
But fines were considered only against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reduction in financial assistance and targeting visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials posted a high level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But at mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the convention to continue to effectively end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Advocate-President Mike Pence is now determined to speak to the congress, now planned for Middle October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomates said.
And the three American agents returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new rage messages or strains from Washington.
A Whitehouse vocabulary for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that could happen may be the special discussion on Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible cross - bombing of the court, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in the country’s attack on our elections.
If the Congress would go over in other hands, Mr. Trump would have to stare in the face in that body, just when he prepared to go again before the electorates, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
It is a lot of asses, and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his equities in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a state arrest against Hitler, if the West had only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and failed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history turns around such turning points and democracy’s coherent course is speeded up or slowed down.
Americans are now faced with various such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump Advocate General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein was in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested to take the president in secret and speculate on whether he was competent for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-selection for a congress that will keep responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we look at those tests, there's a long winter in front of democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovakish Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government who lived at a time in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to go to the Sabbath-kers on that table that wears the swastics.
With it if my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorran optimistics for Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equivalence in Spain against Villarreal earlier this morning, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of Europe League.
A knee injury prevented the middle field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 equivalence against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a jumping place for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away there with a point.
Maybe we could have won it at the end, but an equal count is probably a righteous outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half, and we were the better team.
Thursday is another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game, because they've had a good outcome in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can persist and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but there is now a good feeling factor in place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the teaching is good.
Hopefully we can now persist, last season sit behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this retirement money fear
Despite the fact that recording participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the National Wide Study said they talk to their wives about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationwide's life insurance.
Here's true to begin.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not express your wishes long before the time.
Work with your advisor and your family to preach where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Bring in your financial adviser: Your advisor can also help you to make a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenditure or self-surance with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut off legal disputes at the passport.
Instead of a health care authority so that you instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that experts comply with your wishes if you can't communicate.
Consider also powered for your finances.
You need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incompetent.
Don’t forget the small details: Think that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are concerned, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medicine?
Who will care for the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Multiple times shot in Ilfracombe with windbuckets
A man was shot several times with a bucket of wind, when he walked home after an evening.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "equivalence act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were dead because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami hitting the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and it is expected that the death count rises.
With non-activity communication, relief officers could not get any information from Donggala-regiment, a area north of Palu that is closer to the centre of the 7.5-range shaking.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here's a few key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located on the point of a narrow Bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a rainy stretching over 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, a administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the support pillars of the Central-Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mine building is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 death and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A Tsunami also hit west-Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia is sitting on the Seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A great shaking along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26, resulting in a tsunami hit 14 countries, resulted in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shakings hit the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 range hit the south of Java, Indonesia was the most populated island, which led to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: a 7.6 area of shaking hit near the city of Padang, capital of the western Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-scale shaking hit one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters which destroyed dozens of villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A plane shaking hit the Pidie Jaya rule in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were dead because of buildings that fell down,
2018: Great shakings hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with over 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The shaking destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s Oldest Son arrests on charges of household violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took off a female knowledge phone to her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is arrested at Mat-Su Assurance Facility and is held on a $500 uninsured deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, definitely" when he was asked what he claimed, reported the network.
Palin stars three class A infringements in the face, which means he can be locked up for up to a year and paid $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B infringement, criminalized with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal complaints were made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The matter is currently serving before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of household violence, and possessing a firearm while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake tsunami: hundreds of died
At least 384 people died after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi Friday.
The 7.5 volume of earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been exaggerated with mortality that is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal Prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspects in NYC terreur attack
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected in the New York City terrorist attack that caused eight people’s death – a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, said, used a Home Depot rental car to take an attack on a bike path along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan to harvest walkers and a bike rider in his road in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, chargers will have to prove that Saipov "consciously" killed the eight victims and "consciously" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notification of the intention to ask for the death penalty, submitted in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges may be sentenced to death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal large jury smote Saipov with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for the benefit of depression, typically used by federal chargers in civilized crimes, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "great planning and predecession", said the chargers, and the way Saipov carried it out it as "abhorse, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hern Ferruchi, Hern Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco causes the intentional notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has been over since the Southern District of New York legally persecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for the murder of two drug providers, but was finally sentenced to lifelong prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was killed after being sentenced for a complosure to perform spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were decorated with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to detectives that he felt well about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after he had watched ISIS videos on his phone, according to the accusations.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He innocently appealed to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo advocates representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than to accept a debt recognition to life prison penalty with no possible release, only the trauma of these events would extend to all the affected." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in the control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage gave a vow to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to "feel warm" from Euroskeptists – since one of Theresa May's own LPs had to be in control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone said to the March in Birmingham that at the time "the UK would be out" if Mr. Farage Brexit-secretaris was.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces to unite her deep-distributed officers was given by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his Chequers compromise plan at stake among the attacks of Brexites, Remainers and the EU.
Bonds insisted that she would press the door in her effort to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the death of the European shipping authorities and work forced to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said to the Run Beteken Run assembly in Solihul that he wanted to shot out Chaquers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage had to be made a noble man and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he was in control, we would have been out by time,’ he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I'll rise for Brexit, but we have to kick Chequers out.'
He explained his opposition to the EU and said, "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to rejoice is completely false.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the March and said to reporters: ‘ I simply say, First Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are unfamiliar with the general public, the opposition is not voting for it, it is unfamiliar with our party and our activists who actually bombard the streets and make sure that we are chosen first.
Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their work when they keep their promises.’
Mr. Color told us that the convention politicians had to feel "heat" if they were on the threshold to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now about a trust case between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
‘They try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them ‘We won’t let you get away with it.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘ I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
‘We mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-regarding, proud United Kingdom.’
In the meantime, Remainers marched by Birmingham before they held a convention for two hours in the middle city.
A couple of activists have blown Tories against Brexitbanians after the announcement of the group this weekend.
Workedelman Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they had endured with a partial application as the conference opened.
‘They are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ he added.
‘It's a total cleverness.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren intends to ‘look hard on it’ to stand by President
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she's going to "see hard to stand for President" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts-demokrate spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular criticism of President Donald Trump, stands for reselection in November against GOP, stands Rep Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been in the middle of speculation that her Trump may be going to challenge in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
A attendant asked her if she planned to stand for president.
Warren answered that it was time "for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and it includes in a woman at the top."
Arrested in shooting of LSU’s Sims
Police at Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the gun death of LSU basket player Wayne Sims was arrested Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video from the shooting event Friday and asked for help to identify a man that was seen in the image.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University’s campus.
"Wayde Sims got a shooting wound in the head and was finally dead as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media per 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde went to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton appeals to the world title after team commands gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became evident in the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team orders would play a great role in the races.
From the stake position, Bottas had a good start and almost won Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Fattel to attack his teammate.
Fattel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to ride in the truck behind in the traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes found a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-to-wheel action that the Ferrari driver consciously left the inner-free on the danger of excess to a double-move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the jumping grid and was the seventh at the end of the first round on his 21th birthday.
He then led for a large portion of the reigns as he held on his bands to quickly finish, and stuck Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He may have arrived at the 44th round at the wells, but could not accelerate his pass in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took the fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri had done fantastic all weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team had done extraordinary work to have one-two," said Hamilton.
It had been rich bad body language
President Donald Trump spotted on Saturday at a convention Senator Dianne Feinstein about her insistence that she had not licked Christine Blasey Ford’s letter in which his High Court-genominated Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The President spoke at an assembly in West Virginia and did not directly address the evidence that Ford had given before the Senate Court Committee. Instead, he commented that what had happened in the Senate showed that people were "common and inhuman and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has happened in the Senate over the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are evil and common and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leakages and then they say 'o, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document--'o, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak it... no, we didn't leak it," he added, in a consensus of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that the accusations returned in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had come down from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial well and commented at Saturday evening's assembly, "I tell you what. It was quite bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court-genominated accused by three women of sexual abuse and proposed that the Democrats use the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power with any necessary means.
You see the commonness, the dishonesty, they don't care who hurts them, who they have to run around to get power and control," reported the Mediaite said the President.

Patrick Dwyer cast two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning Saturday the opposition 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants had a early two-target lead by throws from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team straight before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ lead.

Dwyer made sure that the Giants took direction until the first break in when he cast his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again got equal with a power game goal at 27:37.

Air traffic manager dies to make sure hundreds on aeroplane can escape earthquake
A air traffic manager in Indonesia is regarded as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane that weared hundreds of people was safely raised.
More than 800 people were dead, and more are missing after a great earthquake had hit the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong afterchocks in the area, and many are caught in breakdowns in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swing severely on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained immobile to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was at the time of the start, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he day when it drew together.
He died later in the hospital.
Speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death count can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster esteem agency that says that access to the villages of Donggla, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"There is believed that the death count is still increasing, since many bodies are still under the boutfalls while many cannot yet be reached," said Agent Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that had reached up to six feet [6 m] shook Palu, which will keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News, "Every minute brings in an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN, "The Indonesian Red Cross hunts to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday in Palu and said to the country’s military service: "I ask almal of you to work day and night to complete every task related to elimination.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesian aircraft accident: Air Niugini says if one man is missing after beach-seeing aircraft accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed in a Pacific beach in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had eliminated the sinking plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they couldn't account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not react immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officers said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers had stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane had landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had shot over the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had arrived very low.
"It's a special good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through middle deep water until the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the air guards had paniced and screamed and had had a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that ships working close to the improvement of a key also helped with a blowable boat with the salvation to get people to land before the plane fell in about 30 feet [100 feet] water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades, 111 people have died in collapses of PNG-registered airlines, but Air Niugini had been involved in one.
Analists distinguish timeline from evening that woman was burned alive
The State closed his case on Saturday in the rehearsal of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S.- Department of Justice Analysis Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to gather the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the evening that he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together Chambers the evening of her death, contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him whether Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's tract that night, Sanford said he "jok, because my tract was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He sure made her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was planned to start its final stages on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected that the trial would go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A Hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origin of political messages and the approach of social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent re-resurrection in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Any black person?!
NY-childer-girl-in-law couple because she's abandoned to "racist" text.
A New York child-maid declare a couple for discrimination after she received a wrong-admitted message from the mother who complained that she was "other a black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the dispute with "depressing."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her distress when she learned that the new child career, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEE NOG A SWART PERSOON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After she found out her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman thanked me for Maurice and said that their outgoing child girl who was Africa-American did bad work and that she rather expected a Philippine, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent with an Uber home.
Now Maurice recognises the couple for damage compensation on the decline and seeks its damage compensation to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, inhabitant work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such good," she told the Post Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple reacted to the claims that they were racist and said that it was the reasonable thing to stop Maurice’s submission and fear that they would not trust her after they had insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racial.
We are not racist people," said man Joel Plasco the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were inhuman, even though it had been by abyss?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the matter with "depressing" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Do you go after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," added the investment banker.
While the case continues, the court of public opinion was quick to put the couple on social media and to cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that a speaking beer wouldn't bring readers in connection.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very entertaining that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been fierce if his work had been rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the child book on the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death was "bittersweet" last year.
About Paddington, who she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He had been quite a silent man and he wasn't an apple-catching man," she said.
"But because Paddington was authentic to him, it was almost as if one had a child that had reached something: you're proud of them, even though it's not your work.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success kind of in that way.
Although it had been his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor for Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to greet the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was hunted to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors had worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to greet her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors gave her to keep her heart on the knock were slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there waiting, knowing that this was as a breakdown.
I couldn’t shout or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who at that time was hurt for the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers - unconscious of the trial she had gone.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had sank my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I got a overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women mail cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Wallian bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to lead to depression and killed himself on 18 years.
"I want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lived in Lydney and said her son was a promised boss with an infectious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had clarified any room."
But he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who then was 11 years old, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm worried that there will be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, 'to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and who you can talk to, even though it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you must talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas, when the children opened their gifts, he made no eye contact, nor anything with them."
She said his death had been very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it, "It was rubbing a hole through the family.
It disrupts us.
But we must all go and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still indefinite as the FBI’s investigation started
"I thought if we could actually get something like that he had asked--a timeless investigation that had no cover-- we might bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was falling "out" under the confined partisan accumulation.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have had to set up the FBI's investigation?
Their discouragement is all because of time calculation.
The intervening elections are only weeks away, on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans are to lose bad, then they will become severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to choose to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who had met his wife Ashley and was Mr Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has delivered his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come up to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor which Mike Pence, Vice President, will allow to break a match and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea overlaps numbers 'dal' under Kim
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has fallen since Kim Young and seven years ago, said a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-sug cited data from the South’s Unification Cabinet and said that last year there were 1.227 survivions - compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said more stringent border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs asked by human smugglers have been key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The large majority of survivors from the north are finally offered South Korea Citizens' Rights.
Seoul says over 30.000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to walk over than the high-protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
Shina considers the overlaids illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, still technically spoken in war with one another, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for conversations that focused around the striking negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between U.S. president Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed widely to work together for the core-free Korean peninsula.
But Northern Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we unilaterally disarmament ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a talk to the UN General Meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeries," he says he's incompatible to serve at the Supreme Court.
Home minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court-genominated Brett Kavanaugh "hysteries" and said that he was temperamentally incapable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help to think that if a woman had ever acted like this, they'd say 'hysteries'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate court committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh had been very emotional, and at times he almost shouted and shouted while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly disappointed Democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "a ridiculous and coordinated character killing", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s evidence proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was condemned against Democrats.
"I think he made himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to complain of Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and as Democrats gain the majority in the Lower House.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court on which he is currently," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Contemporary Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was as a Democrate concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Cheap Care or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation proceedings, Kavanaugh passed questions about whether he would cast certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, presumed person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women must handle it.
It is a righteous diatribee, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," I said Steinem 45 years later to me.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said she cried when she became angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began crying, she would have said to the person with whom she spoke, "You might think I was sad because I cried.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a partial exit for tooth because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest reminders of an early work in a male-dominated office where I once found that I was crying with nameless anger and grabbed at my necklace by an older woman--a cold manager for whom I was a little afraid--what dragged me into a trapportal.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they have had an impact on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congress Woman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was captured in an out-real relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the revolts, I Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she couldn't explore the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snowwid and the Seven Dwargys".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections, so she gave a vow that she would not enter the revolts unless she had collected $2 million.
It had been a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave to men $1,000 would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get rejection?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target electors rather than delegates, and evil for the sexism - that she had stabbed.
You would have thought I had a nervous crash," recalled me Schroeder about how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporative deposit.
I remember thinking, what are they going to sit on my grave stone?
"She was crying?"
How the U.S. Shina Trade War may be good for Peking
The opening salvage of the trade war between the U.S. and China had been overdevastating and while the battle is far away, a disagreement between the countries may be in the long term beneficial for Beijing, says experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning earlier this year by loading important Chinese exports, including sun panels, steel and aluminium.
The most interesting escalation has rolled in this week with new tariffs that affect $200 billion ($150 billion) items and effectively charge half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing took up goods every time and recently clapped rates of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China promised to equip the US shot for shot and the world's largest economy will not move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to meet publicly the U.S. requests would be too much of a embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays his cards right, pressure on US trade war over the long-term China can be positively supported by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a fast political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can start an economic twelve air in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than attentions already known," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘reed’ for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the land destroyed by war for more than seven years.
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country improve.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe because of progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since then the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need philanthropical assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the plaqued land.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that guaranteed the invasion.
Europe sealed Ryder Becker Victory in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder-beaker 2018 and the US Team won with a final point of 16.5 at 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, let her T-hold in the water explode at the par-3 16th hole and surrendered his bet to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari blinked in all its rounds and became one of the 4 players to ever go 5-0 since then the tournament's current format started in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blowed out by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter from England who might have played in his final Ryder cup.
A Veteran of eight Ryder cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It had been a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia to the European victory.
He hands the fake over to his landmate John Ram who won the US-gholing Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday in a single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old one," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his bets in France and now has a record of 13-21-3- course Ryder-beker record.
A strange statistics by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 big titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekends to find the swimming field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-kaliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Fureich spoke after a disappointing execution on behalf of his team, "I'm proud of these guys.
There had been this morning when we sat a little heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Guard down to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You must keep your hat shaken.
We're superior."
