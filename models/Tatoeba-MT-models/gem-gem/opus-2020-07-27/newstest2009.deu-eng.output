Prague's stock exchange crashes against business conclusions.
After the steady waste in the morning, the Prague Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal day business.
At the beginning of the Tuesday businesses, the Prague Exchange was at the invasion of Monday when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the invasion on the Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American Representative House, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, a dramatic case experienced shares on the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to compensate for some of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later some of the losses were able to compete, so the decline decreased to approximately 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The stocks on the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchanges in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the index.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," says the head of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, that is, independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as in the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, further countries would be affected by the invasion.
A blood bath of American stocks
The American Representative House rejected the plan for supporting the financial system on Monday, for which up to 700 billion dollars (at almost 12 billion Kč) should be used.
The legislators thus ignored the call of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the most important share indices reported the biggest invasion in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar invasion he last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly signs that the draft in the House would not pass through, the index experienced a free case.
Congress consents: US government may pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The Supreme Representatives of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote on this is to be voted at the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators reached a breakthrough in discussions about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid to the American financial system of $700 billion (approximately $12 billion).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
Congress members must negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final text of the law.
The plan for supporting the financial system is negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, the Agency Reuters, said that.
In the Senate, different information suggests that the plan may be voted early on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the pursuit of financial markets.
However, then there is a "development" due to the complex mechanisms, how to help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have explained our different views on how a package of stabilisation of the market should look," said the Democratic Nancy Pelosi to the Agency Bloomberg.
According to their words, a final vote could still occur on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met in the night on Sunday with the American Minister for Finance, Henry Paulson, to grant the government fund its final form.
This provides for a sale of uncoupled mortgage assets from financial companies that are raising financial companies into severe losses and endangering the stability of the whole system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're at the goal," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis also strikes significantly in the share markets that fall strongly.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were endeavored to reach a final agreement before Sunday in the Congress.
This means that investors should be calm on the Asian financial markets in the first time zone where a decision of the Congress could affect businesses on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both Chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, but it is also unclear whether the negotiations could not yet fail a problem in the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next days.
However, the law will experience some changes.
The total amount of aid for the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars are to be made available as soon as possible, as President Bush demanded.
However, the Congress can block the amount of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, at $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush considers progress in negotiations positive
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme has remained, based on the acquisition of finances for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked out everything.
The representative house should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, then the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush also showed satisfaction with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimate the mutual efforts to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy".
Limitation of golden fallscreens
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading subcontractor, claimed that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden fallscreens for directors of the companies involved in the programme and sets up a committee to be subject to the supervision of the Fund.
This is intended to lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also calculates with a help for home owners who have problems with the reimbursement of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates in hypotheses that they purchase, with the aim of reducing monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And therefore, because you don't know by what mechanism and by what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," Marek said this week to the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is adopted now or the beginning of the next week, Mareks view is not essential.
"It is much more important that the congress members agree to support the plan and to adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it comes to an adoption is at this moment the most important thing," Marek stressed.
Duell on knife cutting: MP3 players against cell phones.
We advise you in your choice
While almost every mobile MP3 file can play, no MP3 player can yet call.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to buy yourself just a phone.
Despite all, there are enough reasons why you should make yourself an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the kind of use and claims to future owners.
Surely one buys a great, expensive recorder at home to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news does not appear on LPs, and in a qualitative view there is no objective reason for it.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of at least one of them.
So is it also with the music on trips, that is, with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but likewise a pink-floyd fan may be difficult to use headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each one.
The selection is widely feasible.
The lifetime of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what cell phones can do, they don't even create an indication.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, phoneing and simsing, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, times a worse photo device and may also navigate.
And if you're still involved in the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often, however, you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Only a few phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (in particular the simplest) are clearly more powerful.
Therefore, at the cheap mobile phones, you should expect them not to play more than a few hours of music.
If you then call at times, you should buy yourself another charger for the office to be safe - that's also true for expensive devices.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good holds at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one charge.
There is another problem if you want to overplay the music on your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB lock, as well as no mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be ready without reducing the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players you do not need special software until the exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves place a music library, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre, or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices form only the tree structure of the address list, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones can more
In selecting a specific device, you should explore especially after the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and of course also the user comfort.
Is music especially for you and hear it every day just shortly, for example, in the roadway, then a arbitrary mobile phone that plays MP3 files.
What can almost every cell phone.
You don't have to control specially which music formats a mobile or player can handle.
MP3 creates all, and the most music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most widespread, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can buy a song or album.
This service may be an incredible argument to the fact that a music manual should be made.
Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad and is usually limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
Generally, however, it is assumed that just this type of sale of music (be it will be via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The cell phone wears most of them.
If you want to listen to something, take the phone in the jacket bag while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless free-speaking device.
If not, you can go back to the integrated speaker that has almost every phone, but only the least MP3 players.
The most likely advantage of the music phones will be in price for many.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent Walkman.
The largest disabled will be for most people that no normal headphones are there.
The best and technically mature phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is in the light use.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity when operating with the previous normal tape recorder or, for example, the recorder is obvious.
There is no threat to collision in the form of an incorrectly employed mobile Internet and a subsequent disturbing invoice for data transmissions.
What device should now be used
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding map, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But respect.
Base models are usually only supported cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, then take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB) then you must not put more than 1100 kroner on the table.
If you belong to the more demanding listeners, you prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate buttons for MP3 and the operating comfort comes to the one of a single MP3 players.
Most widely here is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individual MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide MP3 players of the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile telecommunications market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe he won't wait for a long time.
That the Czech mobile telephone providers are working for the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This also confirmed the Telecommunications Authority ČTÚ, who pointed out that the price for a SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming fees regulation, there is as likely a paradoxal situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile telephone providers, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
Why are the prices in Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it is lacking the competition that really makes a fight.
Perhaps it sounds paradox, but in Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile telephone providers would like to shrink that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who often said in the past that there is no room for another supplier in Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with a own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (or, it would probably not find any frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
Just the entry of virtual providers to the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, which then had to respond to the classic mobile providers.
Before the entry of companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain, there were voices similar to those in Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is space for such providers and that they can really be successful.
On the other hand, you don't need to look for examples long.
In February this we reported about the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In only half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers, thus rising to the fifth largest supplier of the country.
At the back of Mobilking, the Penta Financial Group is held in Czech Republic, among other things U:fon.
The advantage of virtual providers is to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are usually profiled as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less comprehensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least half cheaper SMS than his competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a rather good move to put on a non-clean target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Choose real guys Mobilking - the provider who likes them and whom they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could take foot in the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the view of the service offer."
In Czech Republic without chance, the mobile phone providers mean
However, it is almost sure that when a virtual mobile provider acquires Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
It will rather come to a market entrance from Mobilking to other countries of our region," says in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile telephone providers in the Czech Republic are not specially associated with this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything for no potential competitor.
Your interest in launching a virtual mobile provider has been showing the GTS Novera Group, who wants to take a further step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed networks but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them we have already been able to achieve negotiations progress," said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected until the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an inevitable wall of silence.
"On this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in Czech Republic.
The Czech market has a great deal of specificity to other markets.
Until now, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeě from the press department of Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market also points to other suppliers.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová, in rare conforming to the O2 explanation, adds: "We have not yet found a viable and both-sided advantageous project that could be built on."
And she adds: "In the T-Mobile network, no virtual provider will appear until the end of the year.
At this moment we must have a specific offer to think so short-term."
Vodafone focuses rather on the fulfilment of the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the field of breakdown of costs and infrastructure.
This is just what we consider best from the viewpoint of the customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is searching for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - hand-handed with the providers
The approach of mobile telephone providers is easy to understand, another provider has more competition, which would result in lower prices and thus also a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor facilitate the entry into the market?
That the providers can draw on a strike when it comes to something, it is also the long way forward and here about the origin of U:fon.
The strongest pressure in the direction of ČTÚ came from the company T-Mobile at the time when U:fone came to the market.
This also demonstrates publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument why a virtual provider should not be allowed.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new stakeholder would make high demands on the market itself and, in particular, its services."
However, in view of this approach by mobile telecommunications providers, the absolute disagreement of the Czech regulatory authorities is amazed.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, who, unfortunately, in Czech countries, unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It only holds the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, refers to this whole problem, its very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile telephone provider would then be possible after a contract concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not enough interesting for the classic providers", so in his answer to our request Kristián Chalupa from the ÚOHS Department of External Relations.
The representatives of the suppliers would not surprise such a formulation.
This is more than questionable by an authority representing consumer interests and, inter alia, ensuring that nobody misuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual providers work quite normally, it is observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not part of the interests of the UOHS.
Really shocking in this case is the almost already touching conformity of the three mobile telephone providers, which result from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is on the hand.
Just as the absolutely equal benzin price at the tank stations is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this case that indicate any action against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in the matter.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his action on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual providers are likely to lack the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa stated in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTÚ, after telecommunication is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, no one of the Czech mobile providers has a dominant position on such a market.
Some legal experts, however, provide a different viewpoint - for the entry into the market of a virtual provider is always necessary to accept the network operator.
And the mobile service provider has - logically - the monopoly for his network.
This means that it will necessarily take a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the UOHS that three mobile providers are strikingly similar.
The complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the said company GTS Novera) prove that they face very similar obstacles when negotiating with all suppliers.
The rejection of responsibility on the ČTÚ is then a very common tricks in telecommunications services, with which the UOHS distinguishes from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to implement the recently adopted Novelle of the Telecommunications Act extending the competences of ČTÚ to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS have to know that only too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay if no one looks at it
Notwithstanding, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are equal numbers in the Czech mobile networks.
It is companies that spend their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partially public.
In general, it is companies that act in the field of multi-level marketing.
Your own mobile telephone services provide, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come to selectors.
The joke of the case is that the company appears to be a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will receive special prices (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile providers are prohibiting a similar type of resale.
"If there are cases you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal with what can lead to a discontinuation of cooperation with the relevant society," answered Martina Kemrová our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not speak around with the mobile providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such a procedure.
Indeed, the activity of these companies does not disregard them, while they are not affected by the actual official marketing, in contrast to the actual virtual providers.
On possible problems, Miroslav Čepický notes: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot fully possess such as the normal customers of the mobile providers."
But this alone would have to happen at least strangely.
In addition, another question opens up for the UOHS.
Close the mobile providers in front of such a procedure, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the UOHS has quite strong competence to detect such activities, and if it does not, it must not be satisfied with the declaration by the providers that they do not know anything about it and their business conditions would prohibit this.
When Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As the text has been stressed several times, the entry into the market of virtual providers brought a significant price reduction in the various services.
In this regard, virtually in all countries where virtual providers have emerged, classic providers have tried to prevent their origin practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a too small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the high-developed countries, the regulatory bodies acted just at these moments, which did not try to respect the interests of mobile providers, but those of their customers.
If it was by formal measures or by non-formal pressure, they achieved the first virtual operator, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are in the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot eliminate the impression that inclination in competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But we don't throw the fence into the grain.
If the background information is voting and soon a virtual provider appears, the Czech mobile market may start moving again soon.
If a provider permits the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to refusing (discrimination) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National Hymne Where is my home country at the time of the day of the Czech State.
The Hymne was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in chorusing and in a instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already said to the Czech broadcast that he had chosen singers for the solo variants with young, representative voices that are significant and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried both with the choir and then to keep a clear dictation so that you can understand the text well so that there is a coherence," says the director.
The Czech National Hymne will be 175th anniversary next year.
In 1834, the song Kde domov met in the stage of the town theater in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka of Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first strophe of the song was then becomes an organic part of the National Hymne after the Czechoslovakia was created in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the origin of the independent Czech Republic.
Who sounds the "new" Hymne
Prague transportation on Wednesday also on a chip
On Wednesday, on 1 October 2008, the history of Prague transport operations will be entered as a date on which the first passengers, instead of a paper driving licence, enter an e-coupon in the bag, into a subway, roadway or bus.
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people possessing the chip card Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (authorised from 1 January 2009) and be able to play it on their chip card at the same time, at the info centres and branches of the transport operations at the Muzeum Stations, M ́stek, Nadraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letěany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available on the websites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz yesterday.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long hoses for their paper driving licences.
They buy the coupon via the Internet, played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places, the traveller is also available for a switch with a trained staff who advises interested parties on the Internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the map," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on the opencards on self-control machines, which are placed in some subways.
How do such machines look?
You are red, remember tickets, the passengers may already have noticed in the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská stations.
"There are five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it should be eighty," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls an automatic instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays up from yourself.
The electronic coupons apply not only in the capital, but also in the area from tomorrow onwards.
Thus, in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with mainly the inhabitants from municipalities of the central tree region to the capital.
"In the trains that belong to Prague's integrated traffic, train companions have readers with which they can check the duration of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal from the Ropid organisation the driving licence control. This organisation comprises the driving plans for Prague transport operations.
The pre-town buses have card readers on the box at the driver.
When entering, the chip card must be shown not only by the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked place on the side of the box.
Thus, the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"Will a passenger check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than the driver asks for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who doesn't drive with pre-town buses and no longer knows when the coupon's validity ends, can go to the self-control machines where the coupons are played on the map.
Here, the information on the validity of his documents is shown on the display of the device.
The Sudetes demanded a referendum from the United States
In 1945, the Sudetdeutschen had requested the organization of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is evident from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bøhmian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the guardian rule of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945, some groups of Sudetdeutschers should have turned to the U.S. presidents.
This is evident from a letter that has remained in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American President that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Hitler Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies of the German territory, but as a liberator," says in a letter signed with the words "humans whose fate of the Sudedes is at the heart."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudetden Germans - knowing the Czech national charter - suspect that they would expect brutality, unconsciousness, inconsciousness, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection rule of the Böhmer Forest, for today and forever.
"We can't believe that without considering the view of a quarterly million inhabitants of this area, you have spoken to a foreign state to us who is oppressing and trying to eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the allies," is read in the letter.
The reason why the authors can't sign is supposed to be the fear of revenge of the " Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubts the sense of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it is sufficient if he would initiate a national decision in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or under the United States Protective Rule.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive in today's knowledge of the after-war history, it, however, considers some of the time witnesses to draw a good picture of the expectations of the Sudetden Germans at that time.
Although the Bøhmian Germans at least had to know that they would negotiate their departure from the Republic, only a few of them were able to accept such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudedes.
Others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as Budweiser Deutscher at the Marine at the Baltic Sea.
When he came into British prison at the end of the war and was brought into a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of other Bøhmian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would pass them," said Chalupa.
None of the German war prisoners who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia thought that it would be disposed of on the basis of the Beneš decrees from the Republic.
You don't think - then pay!
A emotionally invited campaign is aimed at car drivers
The most expensive action on security in the streets in the Czech history.
It was also possible to characterize the emotionally invited media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on TV, in radio, in cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to bring the drivers off from too fast driving and alcohol at the control.
And they also remind them to guard before driving.
The campaign is particularly intended for young drivers, motorcycle drivers, pedestrians and, not least, professional drivers to conscience.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" battle of the whole campaign also proves:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in uppercase letters on a sign sign.
And in a blood laughter, then the word "pay".
This means that you can pay a moment of unnoticableness with your own life.
The spots will shock the viewers by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo Saxon countries, where you can see normal images with drastic recordings of accident victims.
It promises that the numbers of accidents and the number of traffic deaths in the Czech roads are so lower.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and pizza for the drivers
"For the drivers, the motto of sugar bread and pizza is valid.
Sugar bread means that, for example, when they drive at red, they save time.
The pizza is the threat to a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the transport psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And therefore, information campaigns are necessary in the press and above all negative advertising, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, less effective are tables that make the drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns against a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer observe them," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The Chairman of the provisional Israeli Government Ehud Olmert has spoken for the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, namely the Jordan, Eastern Jerusalem and the Golan hills, if peace with Palestine and Syria could be concluded in exchange for it.
He stressed this in an interview that was printed on Monday by the day newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to subscribe to the Palestinians to a similar high percentage (Israelian territory) because there will not be peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that any return will include Eastern Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to disappear a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in illustration of two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were hurt.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple bearers and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old city.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Subtraction from the Golan hills
Olmert spoke for a departure of Israel from the Golan hills, which he believes is an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the side of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan hills," confirmed Olmert.
"The Syrians only know too well what they need to leave to get back the Golan hills.
They will have to refrain from their current relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship with (shitian) hisbolah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they grant to the terrorism of the (shitian) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida Terror Network and the Djihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stated.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards in the bus illegal?
The law does not know it, in a remote bus it is not allowed to run around
In the context of the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether stewards and travellers are allowed to run and run to the bus during the journey.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," says the speaker of the Transport Ministry of Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which a two and twenty-year-old stewardess died last week was probably caused by the driver of the truck, who crossed the road to the bus.
The young woman sat at this moment on all the accident next to the driver, on which the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or harshly braking, where the Steward is exhibiting coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped with stops after the vehicle letter.
If this is not intended in the bus, the travellers must sit.
The student's travel buses do not have places; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this has first disagreed with the movement of travelers.
This was taken back later, and we reached a consensus that the travelers may go to the toilet during the journey when they have their seat," he declared his position.
The law does not know Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legal regulation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation which prohibits the transporter from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the term vehicle companions, but its rights and obligations do not define it," the speaker of the Hanzelka Ministry clearly adds.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Joseph Pokorný, believes that the law covers this problem afterwards.
"It's about whether the bus has positions in the product authorisation.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are subdivided in urban buses where there are stables and the maximum speed is limited, near-way buses with stables and a higher allowed speed and remote buses with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP expert for transport safety Jaroslav Hořín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid vehicle, not many dangers are threatened, the situation is similar to the service on board a plane.
Even here is not sure when turbulencies come, and the Stewardess can beat his head."
"If a bus is sharp, then, of course, the laws of physics also apply.
Just as in the city bus or in a roadway.
The safety of Stewards must clarify the transporter through internal rules," he also says that this problem is not completely solved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to strike the services
Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred persons in this function.
The Director does not consider its profession to be risky even after the accident.
"As soon as I get the impression that the occupation of the Steward is risky, I will strike it.
Coffee and newspapers can get the travellers when they enter.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the Director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have steward food, but we've been fighting from the beginning.
Earlier or later, this ends with any fatal accident," he had not expressed a full year ago for Týden.cz.
This was an incredible tragedy.
A young Stewardess from the region of Pilsen, who had worked two years for society, was unhappy at the accident of a line bus to Naples.
The Slovenian truck was probably debossed without blinking off the straw and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to evacuate by a sharp manöver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
That the two places were sold for the Stewards, Jančura argues.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to complain about truck drivers.
With a remuneration for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the judgment, but a financial remuneration will also be expected from the debtors' sides.
A change in law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation on Stewards' movement on board a bus could bring up a legal regulation where a thirty-headed expert team of the Ministry of Transport has already worked over a year.
"This, however, has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda, rather the pointing system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the ride," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of Stewards to be a major threat to the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, the letter of the WestLB board to the staff of the House does not lack.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf Monetary Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finance Group" could be created, says in the letter published on Monday.
The WestLB broke a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive incentive to further allocations in the country banking sector.
So it is read if a board wants to demonstrate activity in a difficult time.
Because the WestLB is still under great pressure.
Not only by the Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Finance Services, which the North Rhine-West Falish Government has recently clarified, the time is pressing to find a future solution.
However, the WestLB has been speaking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chef has told Franz Waas in the presentation of half-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house at the Mainzer Landstraße with a country bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, who is carried for half of the national banks and spare banking associations, has commissioned the board to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could involve the capital market business or parts thereof.
The discussions have just started, so it is at the financial place.
From the Deka Bank, which is one of the more important employers at the Frankfurt financial site with their 3000 employees, it is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the spare banking sector.
2003 it looked like the Deka Bank could merge with the Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba country bank for a moment.
However, there was nothing from this Trinity.
Never had the plans become public, the Hessian government argued against the participation of Helaba.
Even the other two houses did not find each other.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have been always thought games about a connection of the Deka Bank with country banks.
But at last, Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba, had spoken against plan games about a association with his house.
Independently, however, it seems to be mature that the aggregation of the various houses of the public sector is in need.
After the country-day election in Bayern is over, a connection of the BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be closer.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure rises to further mergers, you go out and go to the partners for it.
In the south it would only be Junior partner, although it has been through the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
Again, in association with the West LB, the spare- and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is involved with 85 percent in Helaba, has prevailed at the beginning of the year.
At all, stay the North LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is the question of how the different business models of each house fit together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question with which business model the future capacity of the country banks should be guaranteed was not answered by the German spare banks and Giroverband.
At the end, there could also be a destruction of the West LB, which is not of course desired there.
Thus, in the letter of the Board of Directors there is the word that there is in any case a "total solution" for the house.
How this can be brought under a hat with the interconnection of individual units with the Deka Bank, will still show itself.
The second semen week end is known as "Italian weekly"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his friend, and so be everything different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer phase of the Emperor brand, a massively built bather stands and proves the about 200 October festival travelers, which deep tones can produce its throat.
Elena's giving Luca a kiss, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the station of Puorta Nuova, start this evening at 23.45 a.m. four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected at 6.30.
Three buses are especially reserved for the Italians, traveling only Brazilians in a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans already sing alongside their flag, they have already celebrated in the night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says that it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long mantle with pelzimitate feed and a glass with wide silver belts, is one of the buses.
For five years they've been going to the October festival, three tours are alone this year.
At night, on the wheat, back at 22.30.
Nights would only mean unnecessary foods, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the journey, the welcome drink with emperor beer, broke the Bayer's purity offer, the health insurance and the German travel guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll in the night, on the autostrada towards "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers will sleep.
All right, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and wooden churches, where several other buses with Italian marks on the motorway 8 are still paused shortly before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at half seven a.m. at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First: Put the yellow stick up.
The "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, on the left is the address of Marco's Travel Office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors go up to the beer, it's going!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Lop!" Run and occupy the places in the rear part of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, distribute in the room!"
The measure, marching Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget drinking money.
"The security officers show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone."
Thirdly, "Tonight find the point half-eleven again here!" understands?
And it's going to be a little bit.
On the road, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs, and even to the election poster of a large bayerian party.
You want to be armed for the withdrawal.
It is the second semen week end, known as "Italian Weekend".
There are no precise data on figures; the talk was made by 50 000 people on the road across the Alps and invaded in the beers, 10 percent of all visitors should have been extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich Police is strengthened by seven policemen from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bayer Red Cross, which leads to a national statistics in which the Italians set the first place before Britain (approximately 60 stakeholders) and Austrians (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical services.
The court is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, emphasised Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also affects the fact that the German banking sector is not protected from the crisis developments.
For it has now arrived in the weekend.
The Münchner Real Estate (HRE) listed in Dax receives a billion loans from a Consortium of German Banks to protect themselves from the turbulencies on the markets.
One person familiar with the situation said to Reuters on Monday that the loan aids amounted to up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate only needs to interest the part that it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background is losses with daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which it granted money, the government financer had refined itself extremely short-termly, which is no longer possible because of distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve was reduced by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity rate had slightly dropped from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year period, the income from tenders for claims and certain securities and the settlement of deposits in the credit transaction by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenue from reimbursements of post-stored settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the reimbursement of interests in accordance with the order of charge and from the business provision for group companies, the profit minus had remained moderate by about 16 percent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former government financer had first speculated with commercial real estate credits, which had then been distributed in the Aareal Bank.
The Depfa had then become more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the State (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "real material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite uncertain.
The fact is that the dividend was deleted.
She had been reduced by two thirds in 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major government and infrastructure funder since Depfa acquisition.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market as it does not have any customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit grants among the banks have been widely decorated as the banks heard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - approximately EUR 50 billion - of the Depfa credit portfolio for short-term refinancing funds.
After announcement of the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered with the loan at a time that can be seen and the company is protected "from the influence of the currently largely incapable international money markets".
From other sources it should be heard that, thanks to the funds, refinancing is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
The President-in-Office of the HRE, Georg Funke, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets at a definite time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the Bank to hope.
But in view of the dynamics and inequalities of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unprecedented that funding should not be fully used.
But even the opposite is not to be eliminated.
After the event after the bank was still insolvent on the late Sunday evening, at least provisional salvation could not calm the mobs.
The share price breaks by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the borrowing courses are good.
If the priority debts are hardly moving, the courses of the post-release loans are more clearly reflected.
Especially the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably the courses beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-estate loans seem to have been a speculative investment alternative, their valuability must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following the significant sharpness of the banking crisis and of the Institute itself, which had taken over the Depfa crisis.
As long as note banks, governments and less affected business banks are still ready to support the system, as long as a provisional eradication of pensions can be assumed.
Or it happens, which is hardly awaiting anyone to hope at present - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the communications over the state of the country, there has been only a legitimate hope from the security-limiting probability.
In particular, it is likely that long-term believers will prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether to distinguish themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a final point to make a loss lecture for future tax payments on price gains later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 is supposed to imagine the first day of school at the Tachibana high school, the girls start cooking: The German is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
Already before the schoolroad, I had bammel.
I live on the edge of Tokios towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes with the train to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't walk.
The beginning of the education seems not to be as strictly defined at the Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students trigger from 8:00 a.m. until about twenty a short round of meetings starts with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the lesson began, I was on the line to imagine.
I am not the guy who likes to talk to people, nor to a class of 40 students.
Because I hadn't yet a school uniform, I dressed an old rock of my guest mother, thereby blouse, blue knees and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator, I put myself in front of the pult and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all twisted, cooked and winked and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to survival important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'low, sweet'.
And then I'm fast at my place.
The girl next to me grunted quite wide, she found it a honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the Gong sounded, I was regularly intimidated.
Everyone talked and boiled and asked me holes in the stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of their Bentos were packed out.
My guest mother also made me such a lunch box - that's a little different than the dead German breaks.
I had rice with herbs, small worsens, salad of grains and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantle.
Mostly, I don't have a bright shining, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
The things look strange and taste completely new.
It says everything's really delicious.
Well, up to the salty plumes maybe, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento that then creates her very artificially - in the hope to meet the boy closer at the breaksnack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm excited if I can watch this.
'Why does Japan calculate?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because it's fascinating me."
Finally, I've been reading the best mangas for years.
And so I better understand the comics and culture in it, I started sometime to learn a bit Japanese.
So for me, it was quite clear that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a familiarity for tradition, customs and customs.
And there's a great value on it here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here yet, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
rats also have feelings
Does a rat or a sheep flee in danger mean that it also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same if they behave similar to us?
The Internet magazine " Edge" has published contributions from famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness, without that I or anyone else could prove this to date where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, as all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we apply other species and cut into questions of feeling or generally of consciousness, we enter a immobile area because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it is dead, escaped or attacked.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
But I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
For the first part, the almost always associated with human consciousness circuits include the side frontal cortex (for its participation in short-term memory and the execution/control functions).
This wide region is much higher developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic nature is likely to be in the language of the human being: as a large part of its experience is linked to language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, you could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness is not dependent on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may also be created, is likely very different from most of our consciousness conditions.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may look in other animals.
If it is, as an internal and subjective thing, neither can measure nor, because of the special hardware, analyze on the basis of our own experience, its research poses major problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness, which is likely to be more scientifically accessible.
You could examine the consciousness processes of animals without considering their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one moves to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualisation.
What now happens to the feelings?
I resign to them that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call fear is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain-located defence system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves memory.
In this way, feelings are closely bound to the regions of Cortex, which characterize primates and especially people.
Related with the language nature, fine grades of feeling occur, because we can differentiate and categorize with the help of the words and grammar conditions in order to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio argues that feelings from primitive activities in the areas of the cortex and the brain strain are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which concentrates more on the brain strain.
Since this network has not changed very much during human evolution, it may be involved in cross-border feelings.
Theoretically, I can't contradict it, but I think it's invisible.
Pankseep argues what appears in rats and people like fear, probably feels like this in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly?
Does a sheep flee if it feels fear?
In my eyes, only behavioral similarity can not prove equality of experience yet.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain strains, but sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain strain responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove this to humans, how would you prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (as human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I rather explore emotional behaviour than the emotional feelings of rats.
Anyway, there are progress on the neural level, if you measure the same in rats and people.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, even not feelings, I do not know if they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I'd rather come forward than walking constantly against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"This is not an amnestie for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for building or reconstruction of the stages, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM statistics is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We have to work with the highest speed now," said Ukrainian Association President Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us constantly in the eye."
A more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was meeting at the request of Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious risk that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki from the Polish News Agency PAP.
"We have insured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several firstligists had been condemned alone during the last season because of manipulation to forced decline, and eventually even the league start had to be postponed in a short time.
The Dennis Quaid is beaten back
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in the interview about privates - and now have trouble with the Ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan outet her curse Dennis Quaid as a spouse.
It's a shame, and it's gonna be back.
Late Rose War at Ex-Ehepare Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now carry out an unpleasant dispute with each other - in all the public.
Meg Ryan had first said in an interview with the US journal InStyle last week about the reasons for failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud she experienced only after divorce.
The cause for the soul strippease was Ryan's press work for her new movie "The Women" - is told the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Unhearted" it was, said the 54-year-old of "New York Daily News", that "My repeatedly chewed and destroyed the history of our relationship."
It is also "assurable" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is once again "remembered publicly the pain and change that means divorce for each child."
While Ryan lives alone since divorce, Quaid has been married again and has recently become father of Zwillingen.
And then he closed his openings with the sides: "My life goes on at least.
I appreciate that I have a wonderful family that's fine."
Decrease prices for flight tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper, according to a current study.
Flights and nights in hotels have become more favourable again - this is the result of a study by the traveller and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant invasion in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
Since the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, the overnight stays have already been approved in many places.
From January to March, prices increased by an average of 6.9 per cent in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most evident trend had been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year before.
As a cause for this, American Express sees the weak dollar price that has led to a "decreasing travellust of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices as industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices are at 26.3 per cent even the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter also showed upwards in the flight prices:
Because of the ceramic induction, travelers in the economic class had to pay 7.1 per cent more than 2007, fuel-intensive longitudinal flights even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, prices for tickets in the economic class decreased by an average of 12,5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class the price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices increased even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
During German domestic flights, prices have even been half-sized, according to the study.
On the one hand, the reason for price invasion is the disadvantaged economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the flight market brockele.
On the other hand, the open-schoe agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, increases competition pressure.
Signs of the stressed situation were the removal of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines who had notified bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe, these were 24 airlines.
HSV hit Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV will be a table leader.
At the Borussia, Luhukay continues to find a working eleven.
From Kristoffer Small Increase fraction landing for national players Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came to the game lately and failed with a lifter on the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went on his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," Hermann Rieger saddled at the cabinet of the Hamburg Arena.
Many were not free in the catacombs, the semi-time break was finished and most were sitting on their places again.
Rieger was nearly three decades of physiotherapeut of the HSV, he enjoys a higher prestige than some embraced players.
And so his request also found listening to a responsible place.
Assistance trainer Cornelius Jol nicked and lifted up the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Chief Coach Martin Jol.
This command will have sounded similarly: Here with gate two!
Implementation continued.
"There wasn't a nice look today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have wanted it "depressed."
The 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers have to blame the headball meeter of Mladen Petric (11.); and the condition that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," collapsed Martin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their association as class primus.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to order this," said Marcell Jansen.
He realizes that the tableary intermediate certificate is more for the incomprehensibility of the liga than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its lately committed accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Torschützer Petric and the Jansen who FC Bayern rejected - is slow to be able to shine yet.
"We need more flairs and more Dribblings," Jol asked.
After the abstention of the vote
At the Wall Street, the fear is about.
The first messages of the failure of the rescue package allowed the Dow Jones to break in by 700 points at a time.
That was the biggest point loss within one day in his story.
Later, the Dow got something again.
By 20:30 a.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer was noted with a total of five percent in minus at 10.579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in minus.
The largest loser was at that time in Dow American Express, who incurred almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of the Bank Goldman Sachs surrendered by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Grand Investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
In the context of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called faul hypothesis are to be provided.
The sum is not to be paid on a hit, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive share option certificates from financial corporations that could be reimbursed in the event of a corresponding price development in order to reduce the burden on the state fund.
Share rates in Europe and the United States in downwards
The billions of aids to banks in Europe and the United States do not address the doubts of investors.
The share price of the German Grand Bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and cuts down the Dax.
The US index Dow Jones loses the state despite the planned saving of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerce Bank have deeply diminished the German share index (Dax).
The share of the Munich real estate funder lost three quarters of its value, despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, which the Commerce Bank gave up by more than 20 percent.
The dax shield clearly among the psychologically important 6000 points mark and noted with a negative of 3.7 percent at 5.839 points.
Worldwide, the share markets went into the knee.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government's 700 billion dollars' heavy rescue package could not be sufficient to bring the financial markets back to a disturbance.
The dow lost 334 points in the first trading hour or 3.3 percent to 10.809,25 points.
The U.S. Representative House wanted to vote on the rescue plan, which the vote in the Senate could follow on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first surrounded by 3.2 per cent, CAC 40 lost 2.9 per cent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese lead index Nikkei fell by 1.26 per cent to 11.743.61 counters.
In Hong Kong, the Hang sing index shields by 3.1 percent to 18.286,90 points.
In India the index of Sensex lost 506,43 points or 3.9 percent and closed 2.595.75 counters.
In the MDax shares of Arcandor surrendered after announcement of an increase in capital.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has drawn the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourist group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook are not sold.
Dark matter affects flight from space sunshines
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in researchers has led to radiation: Dark matter affects the speed of space zones during the so-called Swing-by-manöver.
Experts fear that the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein could not be quite correct.
Almost 18 years, the space zone "Ulysses" fled through the space.
Due to soon freezing fuel lines, you are now threatening the cold death.
For years, among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has resulted in confusion - the Swing-by-Anomalie.
The Swing-by is a flight manöver of space zones where they receive additional swing in the gravity field of a heavenly body, such as the earth.
This enables the soils to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research zone Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sunshine Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprised for years, however, is that the airlines do not act 100 % as they would expect to do according to the older gravity law.
Instead, there are irregularities in the speed.
The sins become unexpected faster or slower.
To date, the physics could not explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomalie.
Some experts fear that even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of matter by crowning the space, may not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton continues to believe that Einstein did not wrong, and is trying to explain the swing-by-anomalie using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made in the universe.
"Respondent to the anomalie could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space researchers have only known about the existence of the dark matter for about ten years.
Obviously, there is an attractive force, whose effect is observed on other heavenly bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark matter is a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists who were dragged into Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before release, six hostage holders are supposed to have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Solution negotiations are already to be held.
The Germans are repeatedly admitted to the show of Kidnappern.
WELT ONLINE paints the most important cases.
The European tourists dragged in the Sahara are apparently free.
This reported the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV broadcaster Al-Arabia and Italian media in agreement.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports by the Italian TV broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're just checking their health condition," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were well up and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already supposed to be on the way to Cairo.
The backgrounds of a shooting before the release of the hostels remain unclear: therefore, according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to terminate the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It had been "only about receiving the hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Tschad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage owners had demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money was to be transferred by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported on a German intermediary who delayed the release of the hostages because the Kidnappers feared their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be arrested until the kidnappers had a safe refugee.
The German message in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "made to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman's killing herself was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had been in charge of eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Court of Justice in Truro learned that he regularly captured his step daughter Stephanie Randle as she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Mrs Randle died in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had locked her up and joined her eyes before he performed sexual acts, while her mother was gone to work in a hospital.
Trerise and his wife read divorce in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His step daughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs Randle, who worked a large part of her time for the national trust, was persecuted by abuse, which had been added to her twice a week.
Attorney Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and bike driver, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "had given up your life"
In April 2007, her right father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by crushed with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a confession letter that ended: "I cared for her locking and connecting her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "It must have been terrible for her victims, especially as she was only seven years old.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
More worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would be ended before court if it hadn't done so."
He added: "I note the effects, according to description of Stephanie’s father and mother, her deed on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officers responsible for lost data shall be charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June is being accused of the public security law.
The man was chaired by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two highly confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed out to the police.
It is the weakest prosecution within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intention.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that it would be interrupted internally at the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The royal lawyer recommended that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he moved contained Classified Evaluations on Al-Quaida and the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
B&B Costs in the eye of housing companies
British housing companies could be in the house after the salvation of the Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits 2.6 million customers.
The interest rates for this loan are paid by all companies who receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Construction Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it is "inexperienced" that companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loans will eventually be reimbursed when Bradford & Bingley's loans are cancelled.
However, the interests purchased in the mean period are calculated annually to 700 financial firms who accept deposits.
The Compensation of Financial Services Programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions who have behaved carefully ... are now called to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest rates for the loan will be 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the companies must have 81 million pounds for the interest rates of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of housing companies, informed the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions who have behaved carefully during the real estate rise are now called on some of the costs to bear by those institutions that were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the existence of records in 1945.
"We will watch all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members from possibly significant costs."
The interests due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 interests will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are two-sided organisations without companies, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or by lower interest on spare accounts.
Milk becomes five Pence per litre expensive
People in Jersey are faced with paying more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it will increase the large market price of his milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consultant.
The retailers should decide themselves whether to pass the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the large market price of Jersey milk changed last year in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is rejected
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a depositary of the former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Your defendant said that the court refused to excuse a businessman for 50 million taka ($729,700) in respect of the accusation, while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several sweating charges for corruption against them.
Sheich Hasina's long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against deposits at the beginning of this month.
Sheich Hasina was to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Bündnis, demanded that the military-supported transitional government first give her unlimited freedom.
The correspondents say that although their detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release whether they will be able to continue on free foot when they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers indicate that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheich Hasina's depositary bite because it says that she has not to be granted a guarantee, since she is already in jail abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will register a trial against the upper court."
Their lawyers admit that they need security to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheich Hasina is expected to return home after 17 October, said a Awami alliance party president on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over the power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatments.
Both Scheich Hasina, as well as Khaleda Zia, deny all charges against themselves.
Fears for the anti-Polico initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent antipolio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccine programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to one speaker of the UN, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise to not attack or hinder thousands of vaccinations.
BskyB loses complaint in case ITV
BskyB has lost his complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
In the past, the Commission had claimed that BskyB's share distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on the broadcaster ITV.
BskyB acquired his share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed to Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of the ITV, which moved the Competition Commission to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom communications agency, have protested against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share in ITV was an unreasonable and overdriven measure, especially because BskyB had announced that BskyB would give up his voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. State Prosecutor Business
The U.S. General Prosecutor has commissioned a special agent to deal with the cancellation of the nine state prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The reason was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the acts of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, the lawyers and the former General Attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that lawyers had been disposed of for political reasons.
The specialist Nora Dannehy is now to find out whether the officials who were investigated during the investigation have lying to the investigators in order to impede justice.
Serious claims, including criminal action, have not been fully examined or resolved, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The calling of a special agent with the power to force the Witnesses to pronounce was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 dismissed nine U.S. lawyers from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be released due to weak employment.
However, it was later found that the released lawyers had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the cancellations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-level republikan Congress members, while others refused to examine the allegations of electoral fraud of Democrats.
US lawyers are obliged to investigate and persecute judicial cases for the government.
They can be released at any time, but may not be disposed of for political reasons.
The leader of the General State Attorney Alberto Gonzales, then, has been advised by the rejections and has finally settled his office.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also cancelled.
The General Inspector's report has in particular addressed the role of Gonzales critically by carrying the "main responsibility" for dismissals, giving up his leadership role and showing itself in the process "exceptionally disinterested"
Other officials, including the former Chief Consultant of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epical song should be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for his epical hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, the next week in London, will accept his special golden price during the award, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the track to Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for the award of prices this year after it has come into the closer selection in four categories.
The chief actor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song that was written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song appeared on sales in the United Kingdom as single in 1979 and reached place 15 in the chart.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and has sold itself more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he had collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to an acute throat inflammation.
Later, he became aware that he had a cyst on his voice band.
Obskured road in city, often forgotten and maybe soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, sideways and other circumvention roads, of which some are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-term local residents to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small road is located in the East Village and runs from the First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks rather like a dustly street than a actively used doorway.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find it on a standard road plan.
This road still has its admires.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on the First Street.
It wants Extra Place to re-plant to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other worshipers is the long-term neighborhood that says she is fascinated by the short street, just because she is one of the remains of the past of the block.
However, the city administration department, responsible for the protection and construction of the housing buildings, and responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on the Rural Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the urban administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be presented in the next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the municipality Council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offerings how to repair the road and manage what could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure that public access remains guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road was set up new patches and seats, which include a café that the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it did not necessarily want to possess it.
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is to renovate this deceased street and make it a public meeting point," she said and added that the city had proposed the sale itself.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the Department of Conservation, said that it had actually been the desire of the city to sell the street and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the real estate rather than manage.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained something of his historical impression.
Some believe that the street was given its name in 1802, when a large farm that Philip Minthorne belonged to was divided between his many children and a tight stroke land was not claimed by anybody.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punkrock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is definitely most known as the scene for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scratch, lumps and parts of vessels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some inhabitants, including the blogger who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of sale of Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a practically unchanged splitter of the city that should be left quiet.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled with "The Book of the Complaints: A bitter nostalgical view of the extinct city"), published a part of the discussion of the city history of Extra Place, published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote then: "Extra Place is a small narrow sackgasse, which even remains dark on the day and is marked by roasted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and on rain runs past flying weekly newspapers."
With few exceptions, the road looked just like recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back part of the street, not far from the door that previously led to the CBGB, where there is a more expensive clothing business today.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and an empty bottle of beer was located on the ground not far from a fresh plunger of arranged newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be somewhat polated.
Fields, added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the race of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moist and weird.
Discussion on two-language training: education in English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for two-language training.
Lance T. Izumi, head of scientific staff in Kaliphonic Studies and Executive Director of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as well as one thinks: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Hispanian electorates are a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentioned that "the probability of successful completion of school in afro-American and hispanic students is lower than in white students" - what is true.
In order to conclude this distance of performance, Obama's education plan recommends, in particular, a two-language transitional phase in training for those who learn English first.
However, the question to Obama is whether its use for the two-language training, which focuses on education in other languages than English, contradicts its interest in reducing the distance in school services.
As an example of "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in the eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of the students are hispanic and come from families with low income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, astonishing 100 percent of the fourth-class students had the state examination in Mathe at a good level.
It is also surprising that 93 percent of the children from the fourth year of school were considered good in the English examination.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on steady control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach of training in an English-speaking environment. This is the point Obama should take into account, says the school leader Linda Mikels.
This approach values the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialised education.
Ms. Mikels, who rejected the idea of two-language training, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico shortly before. 12 months later one would be able to enter the classroom and no longer recognise it.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learning students?
The school's services would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national image unification associations have long supported the idea of two-language training) and its own consistent support for two-language training make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should cease to worry about the "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance distance, he should carefully take into account educational models that work instead of despise and trivialize them.
The oil price declines due to again anxiety about the economy
On Monday, the oil price was greatly delighted because of the fear that even the American rescue plan for financial markets could not be sufficient to resurrect the economy.
The raw oil final transactions on the New York Trade Exchange have fallen by 7 per cent to $99.80 per barrel during the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shocked by both the financial turbulencies on the Wall Street and by strong turbulences in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices had reached their peak of $145.29 per Barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per Barrel this month to then, again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors showed themselves worried again, although congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan in the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was not yet far completed.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup should purchase the businesses of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place in the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not succeeded in living the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to fall.
Analysts from the German Bank have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about the spread of the US American virus worldwide, especially to China."
The bank's analysts corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the next year, and their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 decreased by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Inside defense Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after he had experienced more than any other in the Jets Tricot in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the jets transformed a resultless game into a triumph.
"I have never seen such a thing," said Ellis.
After a slim game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard touchdown, this marked the perfect entrance to a afternoon in which their developed collaboration took a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which one time went out as an outstanding defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't make a special effort," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were captured, the defense of Quarterback Kurt Warner took away.
Foreign Defence Darrelle Revis took off an unhappy throw and transformed it into a 32-year touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and started it.
Linebacker David Bowens then provided a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets conquered the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were most of the points that the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of Jet's, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On both the answers, because in the third quarter, the jets allowed 21 points without reaching one, Mangini said: "I believe I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Equipped Bresselassie hits his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think it is the best long-term runner of all times after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person who made the route of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds that he had reached last year in Berlin.
Brorselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his multi-sided career, in which he has reached at least a world championship title or a world record on every route from one kilometre to the Marathon.
Last month, Brorselassie left out the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, of fear that may have been overdriven in the afternoon that air pollution could make its asthma problems worse.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - Breakfast has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railway runners such as Brorselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed to long distances, the record time for Marathon has fallen over 2 minutes in the last 10 years since Ronaldo da Costa won from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Brorselassie announced the press that he had had struggles in his wade two weeks ago and couldn't train a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after break and did not come back.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All has been done perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but at the end what was great."
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Rivals from East Africa - that he organized his races excessively, avoiding many world-best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the racing leaders as if it were a railway race, and setting world records on the competition.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of bressels as long runners.
Followed by four Kenyans on Sunday, Brselassie had reached the center of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elimination dopers from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge brewersassie after the pacemakers had left away.
Some more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last entry to separate from Kwambai, who arrived as the second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time in almost 5 minutes.
Camathi became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed an outstanding year by showing at 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all times.
The World Record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Britain.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She has planned her course by leaving a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners first, but after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came as third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the straps in the lives of the black population, in a city of very special nature
Hidden between the outbreaks of the recreational parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic drives, is a quiet city in which the pride and complications of the Afro American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three rocket places, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today, it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that it describes – and it made a tourist destination by entering it to the Florida travel guide, which was produced at the time of depression by the Federal writer project – in many respects a place of the very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, devoted and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "as little knows about us that he doesn't know what's going on."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidency candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on race relations, many are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very interested in how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and municipality member of the oldest church of the city.
It must be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is a historic example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
It is, on the one hand, a highburg of literature and on the other, an example of - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that inhabitants here are both proud and on the guard.
And so right, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as all of us call Hurston.
She presented her home city to the world in books that came from heart and were written in mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Travel Leader changed the city, which is close to route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frech like Oskar, both in real life and in literature, led Hurston Reader to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Besides the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-weightly highlighted modern school, with its cared gardens and playgrounds, which always cares for Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Witness Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sell drinks of any kind and what-auch-immer fits for hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus brought Eatonville into contact with self-regulation, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was definitely not a travel guide.
Indeed, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls forever the Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual plays.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
You still remember Hurtson as a lively excentrician who returned regularly after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
August Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston broke into the city, she mostly did this without a warning, in a tremendous chevrolet, smoking and dressing with pants, in a city that today pictures something on her honorable dressing style.
According to Mr Franklin, most inhabitants were fascinated, while many of them despised.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while he shocked in his chair, on a rear terrace that looks at the Sabelia lake, in which Hurston was baptized for all probability.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and captured her books.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary companion of Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was placed in a anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida.
In Eatonville there was no great Memorial, no public readings in large style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or her inheritance in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track motorway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlando's forests had already pushed the motorway 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Compulsory integration, among other things, had ended the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial interference brought hatred into the Community.
"In this time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the off-site people," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel asked the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision against the school council as "political rather than respecting my race".
Inhabitants today say that although the lifting of racial centres in some respects was positive, they weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his youths.
"Black children were used to get armed - I remember - they embraced his teacher in the morning and they embraced his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business leader of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural climb," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, the citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who rejected prejudices, as she did, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for her revelation.
Five years later, a very praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the book halls and again made it part of the American literature cannon.
The remote road project came just at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter once again was in the light of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a rescuer.
In 1988, the municipality began planning a Hurston Festival to show what could destroy the district with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-track remote road survived the city, accelerated the whole at peak speed, woke up real citizen chair," said Mrs Nathiri.
Mrs Boyd expressed it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
There came more and more tourists, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who went here to church since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was recorded in the historical register in 1998.
A new single library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly planted and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlandos, she can sometimes feel like a rear gas in the summer rain, as small as then when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black today.)
Outstanding in search of Eatonville's history and its significance are still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white and representing black men in field work - may not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a favorite for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston Festival grew, a higher degree of home pride was also born.
Above all, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with all its problems, not worse or better and as proud, creative and zealous, ugly and mixed as any other race and nation group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after the college to Eatonville to work in the city management or at the police that could use some help.
And even the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who are just going through here will think, "Ah, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on one Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, there's a floating financial latitude.
At first sight, nothing changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were remote from the newspaper modes and the huge television screens in the Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they were in the middle of a debakel.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shakeless offices with the glass facades, bankiers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, they have daily the worst horror working day since the stock exchange crash of 1929.
The suppliers still push the metal tea walls along climbing and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still swallows between apartments as human packets load around the 50 belted T-shirts that hang on a yoke-like stack on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for the citizen-steady foods on their breakfast ball and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a day of the week between 16 and 19 a.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon I decided to open a new savings account because of all the world's downturn.
Although I had decided to lay my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branches, about 20 people were standing snake.
Not to the money switches to cancel or pay money, but to the customer service switch where Stammkunds order checkbooks, tourists ask for the road to Macy's Buy House and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", was for the same reason as I was snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already lifted their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they retired, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had reimbursed money from so-called trappts (a little like a building spare fund), cooperative banks and local savings banks, which only have branches in one state, and say they treat their customers as a family.
Last year, 15 of these banks have gone quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with an amount of $327 billion, went home in bank management over and as the last Friday of New Yorker during the weekend, was looking for a rescuing buyer, Wachovia, another bank that has savings in value of $440 billion.
In fear of another crash, the office and shop employees brought their bares to a bank that is considered safe port, a bank responsible for most salvation purchases at Wall Street.
New Yorker's entirely normal financial deadlines in the last few weeks.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese supermarket, with so much confidence referred to Lehman Brothers, the Pleite bank, and their embarrassed governor Dick Full, as if she were to read about a faulty colleague.
And Lyn, who is around the 50-year-old concierge of my living block, has escaped from our usual entertainment rooms about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I have all my savings in money market funds now," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to risk anymore."
Muslim graves damaged during judicial rubbish in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-righter of the Austrian Rights Free Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, member of the Belgian Rights Pertei Vlaam's interest, participate in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to represent the organisation "Stads against Islamisation".
They carry signs in the style of transport marks on which a mosque is pictured, stroked with a red line.
The police accuse legal extremists of grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extreme right parties, of considerable gains in the parliamentary election of the country.
In the evening of Friday on this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an organized action, according to the police.
The actors sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officers believe that this is an attempt to swallow the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said that she was "deeply shaken" about the message of the grave scanning, which took place when the religious month of the Muslim Ramadans tends to end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country went to the right in the last parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the future of Austria, who received almost 30% of the votes in the far-right direction, were engaged in their electoral struggle for a strict anti-immigrant law, and some of their votes were criticized by opponents as foreign enemy.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, engaged in a ban on headtuchs and Burkas and even announced his rejection against food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minerates with the argument that these political symbols are continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Surveillances and analyses carried out directly after the election, which indicate that the extreme rights of the most political block in the country are, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel blocks for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, who has been condemned to the sexual abuse of children, was judicially prohibited from traveling to France and Spain.
Judge gave Glitter a six-month lock after he informed the control authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The police in Kent was granted last Thursday to impose a foreign travel block after she presented proof of excessive penalties to the judges for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Office Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning lawyer.
EIn Speaker of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Police Kent at Ashford's Office Court requested permission to prevent foreign travel from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the register of sexual criminals, Glitter, 64, the authorities informed that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police seven days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a penalty of 5 years.
The police in Kent said that she would not discuss individual cases or glitter's possible residence in the country.
A speaker of Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"Our view is that it is easier to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the highest concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual criminals in the country to minimise any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter fled to Bangkok, where he was supposed to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him by passing control and he fled to Hong Kong after some of them.
The Chinese authorities also refused him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials claimed to return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the court of Uxbridge in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for the authorisation to require him to register himself as a sexual criminal.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 because of the possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the Minister of Interior Jacqui Smith was calm and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no hands, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the large flamencot dancers who dismiss the concentration and devote themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or a man.
One-sided artist
On the other hand, personality
I look in private life, in these moments that are foreign for the audience, I know when I can find the depth of a stealed view or expression strength of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to join the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer represents theatraliks of some scenarios with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was not known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamencoding at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the Flamenco month's photography, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which grows increasingly from day to day, explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' `every man can be, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on the stage.
All normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to move the audience on stage passion, sadness, joy.
In order to maintain the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on the stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What I was interested in creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the largest flamen comeists with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the Festival `Cante de las Minas', took a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera's sorting function and the existing material, pictures created that remember classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, which gives the image the modernity and idea of how the farmer Flamenco understands: `Music with traditional roots that change and are surprised every day'.
This is not just the dance, the song or the instrumental game in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who is conducting the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that will be visible in the form of hearing, of His, and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallerie of El Fotómata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion to the portraits led him to react this idea two years ago and realise it as 'portraits of the veterans of sport' ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer likes me to photograph people, to know them and to put me in their life condition, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You hit yourself or stand on people, personalities that you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you for a couple of minutes alone to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realise my ideas."
The collection of the portraits of the Flamencos from today with the title `Flamenco-people' is issued in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street with the name la calle de la Mata, parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he just writes is a great courage.
He does not even know where the Roman's act takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to promote the project at which he is working, a novel with the Protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived twenty years in the Congo and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prizeholder confessed that the project he is `a great courage' and 'all pointes out that he would not have to write the novel'.
`If I were concerned, I wouldn't have done it, but I'm going to do it and hope to end the novel at some point', so he closed his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the course of the four days, he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities on the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Premium of the Festival Hay Festival and gave its voice to most attendees, is compared with the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and is seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had a audience before himself, which noticed that the Peruan, who has a wonderful memory and great humor, had not been given enough time to go through everything: as his call for literature was created from 'exceptional adventure lyst', from 'Freudy reading' and 'more wants to experience than before'; as he writes and 'Disziplin warns' to supplement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and reviews that he makes; like Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his call and what 'Getting image' it is the basis for his stories.
The hispano-American Roman writer admitted that there is no way to measure and where to know whether books change life, but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a volatile experience, stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it produces 'effects' and 'the people even more apart', therefore I asked the writers not to leave the lightness and take over the responsibility for his call '.
During the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bull fighting feasts fell partly.
After the announced bull fighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bull fight feast, with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be completed, was moved on yesterday morning.
Thus, the organiser, with the consent of Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bull feast.
Thus, the festival of the inconstant weather was exposed, so two of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it raind, so the second planned bull feast could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadore composed of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfarena.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luce, who cut three ears and triumphed after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and a ear of the bull, which had succeeded more by galoppering than by his bull fighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, a large part of the audience reacted in his second battle with buh calls.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, loaded with two thousand kilos of hasch.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago ten.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon, Álava.
Two cops urged the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took the escape.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of hash.
The police persecuted them and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A.A.J., as it announced the Inner Ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the transport police of Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to perform the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped on the edge of a few kilometers. At the moment the drivers came out of the car to flee over a country road into a forest area.
The police of the city Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of Haschisch, which was captured by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with sharks which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and to the scale of the plungel to other police services.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was 'doublet', so that it did not match the mark specified in the CFZ papers, and therefore was also arrested because of the fake of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue to investigate the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned above, could flee but also find the origin of the infected drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. A. J. was brought to an inquiry to a police office. It is sent to the prisoner in the next hours.
The actress Heather Locklear was arrested because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The actress Heather Locklear, known by the role of Amanda from the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested in Santa Barbara, California, this weekend because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
One Witness observed how she tried to run out of her parking gap in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokesmen of the California Transport Police report to the magazine 'People'.
The Witness explained in detail that Locklear pressed through the gas pedal at 16:30 a.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward out of the parking gap, and when she went back, she caught her sunglasses a few times.
Something later, the Witness, who at first probably hadn't recognized that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and went out of the car.
The Witness was the person who announced the emergency service because she lived about Locklears.
When the police strip came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the road and thus blocked the traffic.
`They seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to one police speaker, the actress showed himself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. "The first observations of the officials resulted, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine," the speaker said.
Locklear was suspected to drive under the influence of an unspecified substance that could not be determined and brought into a local investigation prison at 19 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the hospital in Arizona, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares is insisting that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and members of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will meet the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the Council House in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who was withdrawn last week after being accused of making business with family members.
`In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who must take over the responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out the way the party must have to have toward the one who is up to now sitting as a city council in the municipality of Sevilla.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for the 'Transparency' in the possible investigations of the irregular breaches that Silva could have started: 'The VL was always insisting that such cases would receive maximum transparency.'
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero book of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spanish against the French. This is a wonderful film in filmography, with about 15 million euro investment for the turning work.
In this way, the Cineast tried to present a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he always admired at the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci today explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday will be presented in cinema and will later be shown on the broadcaster Telemadrid as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this turning work his `Kindheitström' fulfilled. This he owes Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago ordered him to turn a Memorial film to the second century celebration in Madrid. Especially because the history is based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the task.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for turning, Garci, as he added, offers the "one-time opportunity" with the help of decorations and the corresponding clothing the picture of the "confused Spain", which selected the wrong leader for fighting, because the people had been represented by the fight for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII.
However, the Cineast regrets that funding as for 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as for 'Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the turning book with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be rotated.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', was involved in his ordinary work: he set himself on the stage to the actors with which one must first test before starting to turn and for those who had not cast, he appeared `s humiliating' and respectful, 'a part of the profession of the film director is to provide assistance in the theatre and in the cinema to know what happens in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many performers, on whom he stands in `Sangre de mayo', have to repeat before his camera, such as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is the view and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo' nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' nor finally the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci expects no awards for this film.
`In the beginning you think you are working for the descendants, later you notice that it is only for joy, and now you are satisfied when you have produced another movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Sevilla is a dancer who also comes from Sevilla.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusier (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert for Oriental dances.
She had a exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the woman's emancipation, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhistine, a vegetarian and sat for the abolition of the corsett, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her tracks in the dance and esthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed me this role, which seemed impossible to me.'
"We are not trying to tell her about her life without keeping her esprit," said the flamencot dancer.
Your dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, the dance of the butterfly appeared to me like Guajira, or the dance of the serpent like Tango.
Her dance was sensible and I have been told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area', she claims.
The scenario is based on two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her ideas, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work exceptionally with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The inscention is also expected with musical composition and the guitarists Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the Percussion of El Pájaro, and the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the cooperation with the actress Juanfra Juarez, he takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas in which he always loves.'
This work also tells you in a particular way about the life of this woman, who became known in so far-sized places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
`I wanted to recall her, because I think it is one of the women who have a huge influence on a particular period and whose works are no more today and they are even less appreciated,' claims Bayón.
The idea takes place today at 20:30 in the Theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture in order to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to remind the fiftyth anniversary of the award of the literature nobel price and the death day of both.
Thus, the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress that takes place in New York, with the restoration of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia's house museum and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the andalusian world poet more known.
The United States can imagine bad without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who cooperated with him in 'Sensation Reporterin', and from the dominant idea of the US-American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Look what she cost to give him the Oscar.
And when he went back in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Yet, this was a great struggle for everyone.
`What you sometimes feel is much more than a expression, and now I lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford crying, 'my life and my country were the biggest fools of his life.'
No one was afraid not to make himself ridiculous or to exaggerate.
As 'father' of the cinema and the father's country, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and the market collapse, in which the defeated self-value of the Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity.
If there are few people who can admire in this hard time without virtue, you do not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he had a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as a number of losses as well as gains: from the foundation that has written the fight against drugs and to honor his son from the first marriage that died of overdose was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it cost him a lot of effort to enforce a deadly nutrition culture.
A wide wave of surprise strikes haushoch over Hollywood without respect for nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, confirmed that not just one man died, but the whole era.
The English Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prizes, said that the work with Newman was no longer or not less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the largest of us all', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who trusted today to try to live like Paul Newman lived: maintaining high demands for justice, leading a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always simple or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone trying to, and Paul Newman was an example.
He was divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
`Why should I eat a Hamburger on the street when I have a filet at home?' he often jokeed himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily usual in America.
"From all the great roles he played on no one, he was as proud as to those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the careful grandfather and the Philanthropen," they say.
The roads in Madrid are inadequate for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organise some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was called perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst road with everything around and on that there was.
Of course, this is a lot of foolishness if you were to observe the assessment and I could check it, would clearly not have been done.
But, from the beginning, let's go through everything.
The fool starts with the ticket pickup that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem to be bad either, but if they already let you happen, they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid the stumbling on the street).
So don't.
Here they just let you pick up the ticket (the first fool, which is to go only for that reason) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second fool because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis, only small, much cheaper shirts were decided to buy from less material?
So good, things like these are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Besides that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes, which is impossible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road started and we hadn't let our back bags lie before it, even if it had succeeded once, but it would be more difficult to get back.
In addition, it looked like, in these 40 minutes waiting for rain, so it came to the temptation to organize a people rebellion and overcome the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people with lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in time in the classification because of this chip that I have received, I can think that the exit was mismeaning.
Of course, if you were to ask me for a perfect road, this road would never intervene in me.
So I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organised by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image identification system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without a lot of intelligence, which is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in case of Microsoft it is a route planner to move on the company's campus). The system observes what it hears during the entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face detection system, this `receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of their entertainment.
It can also arrange the attendants in the groups after the conversations.
In the presentation video `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not belonging to the group that leads to her conversation and that it is not a company employee either.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That's certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week they spoke very surfacely about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and do not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Human, Steven, that will be just for the few.
Everything is only one finding if you remember that Microsoft added some function in Windows versions and `Extras'.
The change in direction is worth
The Microsoft has the right to lose the operating system gradually of importance, just as the software.
When Google Chrom appeared in the network, this was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Suitable many pointed out that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an essential part, will always be necessary to enable hardware and software to function at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or husband when it comes to notifying his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you must think of his 'Death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, for more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to perform the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and we spend more time every day on surfing than in the surroundings of the 'window'.
What is half the use of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Light, not too excessive, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more to integrate its online services, which can then become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without doubt.
I took the picture of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreational rooms for Microsoft Employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refresh drinking machine a sign is attached: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of the employees used Microsoft, Google for network research.
Furthermore, last week was also confirmed that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will appear not at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather than 2010.
Microsoft seeks the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothes of a well built priest.
When we start counting the countless star appearances, we can return to the picture of a very strong man, with a peak bart that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circuit.
In fact, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, herballess and tailored.
The English speakers call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Brussels, however, exceeds all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. The legend tells us that the name origin is connected to sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' overrides all because of its excellent cotton, because of its different Unisex cuts, and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (ca.) that these T-shirts have as detail at the neck section.
And respect, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have college Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kashmirs, pants of cotton, T-shirts with strips, babys, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's very bad to use it as underwear.
You're very angry.
"I want to be a young mother; for the candidate I don't worry."
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is delicate, but full of joy of life.
At present, the sisters Gruz take their new activity very seriously in the fashion.
For Monica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the Mango company, moved to her residence and also makes the presentation of the most important prizes in the fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion house.
Mercyful and shameful, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and also visited the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner of Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and the 60s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and observe women as they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I believe, but at last, everything meets in one and these areas have many commonities.
Since I was young, I was enthusiastic about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to roll around in the clothes of my aunt and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a recreational park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in teaching and in the samples to look into the mirror and feel good.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real actress role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and its professionality.
You've recently become 30, haven't you been in a crisis?
Oh, something.
I feel better than ever, than thirty years old, I feel good.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things I've wanted to do since I was young, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, are you thinking about becoming a mother, isn't you?
For a long time, I know that I've become a mother because this requires my body and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to let that go.
With regard to the candidate, I'm not worried.
I'm going to give my child great feelings of happiness and to teach it with much love.
With regard to film art, you keep in mind the works you have participated in and the last year have been rotated.
That is the case, and I would like them to be presented to the public.
As a woman coming from the theatre, I am very impatient and unhappy and I want to have everything at once, of course, that cannot be immediately.
I would like `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' to be listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A few days ago, you appeared on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's good, don't say that.
It's not that I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, which I have known for some time, has simply called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the welfare event of her organization `Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothing pieces from our collection for Mango were auctioned to collect the money for Naomis NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, as the one she knows, would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this great-hearted thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handhold, I will do that too.
To support the women in the third world, whatever is necessary.
The drivers, which can be relapsed due to the alcohol level, will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The Authority orders that the driver who had three official punishments due to the alcohol level will install in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunk state. If he is alcoholized, then the car will not go on.
The initiative has already been announced last month in June and is now part of the report of the General Attorney Shepherd, according to its information it is a pilot project which will last a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, which is why he receives a course for the retraining of traffic behaviour.
Apart from the General State Attorney, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Safety of Automobiles will also participate in this.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers, who were shown more than once because of driving under alcohol influence, returned to tax.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents autostart if the driver has made alcohol tests; or if a alcohol concentration is detected higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by the one who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices have prevented up to 65% of the infringements of rules in the first year of its introduction.
In Spain it is expected that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take this action into account before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented in the usual way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required for the criminal persecution process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been built in some use vehicles and public transport vehicles.
In the morning, the parliamentary House will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British pointline at 17:40 p.m., at the time planed by the program, next to the presidential hanger of Benito Juárez de México DF, the plane of the Spanish Air Force traveled with the prince and prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but its rays have still forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair that came out of the plane.
Direct on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturia visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, there you can't take people at the airport at this time you're from here or so.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived a couple of years here.
- Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the prince of Asturia is and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the Hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 Marine soldiers, giving honor salve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with long hair weighed by the wind, without usual 'peep-toos', maybe she was told that it was expected to be a weather in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers waiting for the official succession.
At the door of the hotel where they are placed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from the Mexican TV is waiting for her to make jokes.
The best premium of the fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designer and bonuses than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashioners.
This is awarded at a money price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the show window of the Mango branches on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and wept almost because of the emotional excitement.
In addition, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have happened that are related to the fashion designer Valentino want to thank for his jurisdiction in competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the area of many famous people, the board organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the severe heart that was broken by pain because his brother died recently, kicked together. He dressed the dress from the fashion house and had some jewelry of ELAH that was stunning. He stayed on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of Mango's house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended with the baron of Rockschild without jackets, because jackets they borrowed the ladies.
Monica Cruz, has hurried to business and had a pocket and a shirt that she modelled herself, and to dinner she had a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was in excitement, remembered the old times, grabbed a bar and made a kind of `grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the Palace, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always generates a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed linen and towels) at Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked to have a room without smell.
The stars under the starly sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's how life is.
1001 Council against Stress
There is not 1,000, but one more way to forget chaotic life of everyday life.
And if there are few, all of them are collected in a book in which it says how to get to relax. The book comes into the book stories on 30 September.
The alarmer is a punishment when he rings at 7 a.m., but even worse, the idea appears to come back into the hectic rhythm, which requires the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one and not two methods to fight the daily fatigue and the problems of working world.
However, the number rises, no more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga statements, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book represents the full list of options that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and so the rest that the book provides comes into the book stories by the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Those who believe that it is impossible to reach peace in areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual rejects such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit on the sofa, switch the brain and concentrate on reading.
Talk in sleep
Some children speak in the night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened on the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be afraid, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disturbance called the talk in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially in children and youths.
Surely, more than one of you were told that you spoke in the night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regular (every day, once a week, once a month ), the child can remember nothing on the next day.
There is no only reason to cause this appearance.
Often links are searched with other appearances in the sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear in the night, Enuresis noctura (bednuts in the night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have mentioned earlier, it may be very high fiber, stress situations or excess.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite a opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be monitored and advised by a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus occurs.
We have said that it is a positive disturbance, so it will not be treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disturbance that can be treated (for example, with the sleep apnoe or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to cultivate the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children whose relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
When the talk occurs once in the sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will remember nothing that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will rip it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it's sleeping, so it's resting.
Remember, when a couple of appearances show anxiety, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child has for fear.
When they understand what it says (which is not so usual), the child is not under pressure to perform an inquiry and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything, because if the child is sleeping, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that they are careful about the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Illhouses ... at last
After a long thirst course, Illhouses on the field are finally back on a successful course.
Without a lot of effort, the yellow blacks played many Torchances and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this meeting, at which the attackers were trying to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot was closely precending the angle, Illhouses should dominate the game with lightness, and it succeeded alternately first Fonderflick with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the field center and only passed through the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half time should be crucial with first two torchances fought by Riahi and temporal, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Illhouses by Marais, who was exactly right to accept a ball that had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the illhyusian portrait should not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and about twelve minutes later being sent to the bank, so that his crew companions had to continue to play countlessly.
Denmark, however, did not use this, and did not face any major problems of an illhaeusian eleven, which just moved back a little to defend their defense, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball, after a great breakdown, predicates very close to the late.
Sarkozy hits angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another stacker to the Bretagne.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several breton and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to find himself in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he would come with 'concrete proposals'.
At the same time the President's visit takes place as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee set up by the British fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which has reached an average record value of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies become competitive again and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of the sailors.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led in the Morbihan and Calvado protest march, which caused a stand of nearly ten kilometres long.
Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not cease.
The island of Quiberon was bounded by a lock.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning on tyres and pallets from the early morning before the fuel depots of Brest and Lorient ports, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the Ermel Canal, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoe of trade ships.
The fishermen of turballs and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique resolved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding about possible measures.
Indeed, the Guilvinec crisis committee must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the debate planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsible national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
"The stroke will continue," for "the fishermen will not give up in any point" and "will not go to Paris," for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient announced.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel costs about 50 cents at present, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of Wonderful
The unforgettable shower from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 by the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes, accepted the filming and engaged actress Paul Newman who died at the age of 83.
Embraer holds his delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the threatening recession, to be a danger to the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, has its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size of 30 to 120 seats.
Until now, Embraer 41 machines have been delivered to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the American International Group, which has been financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, considers to reimburse more than 15% of his assets in order to reimburse the 85 billion dollars that have been allocated to it.
AIG is willing to control the sale of a large part of its businesses, beyond their international life insurance and their age-care in the United States.
According to the FT, the Administrative Board of the AIG Sunday evening met to check possible sales.
AIG could not be confirmed.
The FT continues to explain among the assets of which AIG might distinguish, their airplane leasing-filiale International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in the back-insured Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate and its investment in private equity.
As regards this sale, no definitive decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG has to do the sales to reimburs the loans over 85 billion that have granted it to the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the US authorities receive 80% of their capital and lose the current shareholders to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the Meeting of the Historical Morning Meeting
On Monday, after the representative chamber had rejected the plan Paulson to rescue the banks, the New York exchange reported a historic case of the courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of approximately 800 points, and the afternoon 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365,45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684,81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of trade decline after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final rates, the index afternoon, mainly relating to technology, has fallen by 199,61 points to 1.983,73, and the widespread index Standard&Poors 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Members, which should allow a bit of stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes against and 205 for this, the Members refused the funds he had asked to the financial secretary Henry Paulson.
Nearly two of three Republicans rejected their plan.
`Here is a bad picture put in circulation that represents the congress as incapable of adopting a plan', said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market was counting on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days will come too late.
`If the project is actually condemned to fail (...), it will be a quick task of the Fed (American Central Bank, Note Red.) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would even more restrict the credit conditions', Brian Bethune, Head of Economics at Global Insight warned.
And Miss Piegza stressed the feeling of extreme urgency even more, 'what every day, which goes, brings the ruin of a financial company in the United States.'
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned the purchase of Wachovia's banks by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures to the benefit of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, an indication that the markets looked forward to not only an American but a global crisis, the Analytic of FTN Financial added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenues of the State Bank within 10 years have decreased from 3.632% on Friday evening to 3.827%, and revenues within 30 years yesterday evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first TV
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House from Friday followed another to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this TV, which was to be persecuted by a third of the American families, both the Republicans and the Democrats.
The political analytic David Gergen estimates that John McCains performance, although very apparent, was not brilliant enough to allow him to stop his decline in the elections five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published a question of opinion on Saturday, according to Obama with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the democrat is clearly making the better figure.
For the undecisive voters, so those to which it comes now, Obama showed 39% as winners from the surveys, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% of them saw McCain as a winner.
Obama should be able to Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
`It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to put his incontroversy experience in the field of foreign policy into the foreground, and thus clearly underline the 'naivity' of his opponent regarding these issues that were the focus of this first TV.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he stressed several times.
`I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to become President', he also assured.
An attack point preached in the Republican election advertising spots since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represented the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without being able to get out of the version.
He put his ability to make good decisions and to renew the picture that the world has from the United States.
"McCain, however, has not yet understood, Obama," this weekend a democratic election advertisement against the fact that the Republican has not taken into account the complete extent of the crisis that has been loaded on the 'American from the street'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama plunged up before 200,000 people who had gathered in streaming rain at a election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'Mediterranean' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, which the Americans think the best to save the economy even at the edge of the ground, a clear advantage.
`The next week could represent a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday the influenceful democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton Government, compared the 'good economic instinct' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the conclusion of an eight-year economic policy that has been implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After remarking that he would even be able to lower the taxes for 95% of the Americans despite the fluctuations on the Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energetic independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, has the highest priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build an installation from 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates are carefully addressing the questions on the plan for saving the financial market over EUR 700 billion (470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress yesterday evening and are extremely unloved by the people.
`Have you noticed that there was a choice in Minsk?'
Young people and opposers demonstrated Sunday evening at the main place of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of Parliament's elections in advance.
Some hundred white robes gathered Sunday evening since closing the election rooms on the Minsk market to protest against the fraudulent nature of parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: 'The dictator is to withdraw'.
Some admit that they haven't chosen at all: 'What's useful if they do with my voice what they want', says a youth.
You do not believe that the regime that has shown the best light on foreign observers in order to resume the negotiations with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The penalties, including the non-release of Visa for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the resignation of certain assets, could be revoked if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
`We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the statement', regreted Juri Potemkin, Union press speaker of democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europa movement, because it is important who tells the votes, and this is the executive for us.
If Members of the opposition come into Parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament may mean time of broadcasting in television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of intervening in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is strongly guilty of Russia, is in a crisis and we are not reforming, we are at risk of being a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which has followed the election procedure, does not recognise the election as valid.
It emphasizes that the numbers of elections appear too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) has led to the way for any sort of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that a choice took place?, the leader of the Social Democrats, Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released this year in August.
No one was in the election rooms.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in Parliament, those who are best in line with the government's ideas.'
The silence of the night drops over the October square again.
In the television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Reconciliation - From blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her foundation, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has recovered public confidence, which had been severely shocked by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the blood donation of the Canadian Red Cross during the 1980s were infected with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the government of Canada launched a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994 aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and drawing up directives in order to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever still hesitated to submit his report, several provinces then put a committee on the legs whose aim was to develop a new system for the management of blood conserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this assignment.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up its work, nearly 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the huge efforts to improve the safety of blood conserves and work in this area during the following years, we have recovered public confidence," she says, before she prides that early 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps aware that "trust is something very violent".
Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the principle of caution since its establishment on 28 September 1998.
At this time, we experienced the appearance of many cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman who has been headed since the foundation of 1998.
`And we didn't have the least idea whether this disease could be transmitted through blood.
So we refer to one of the main directives of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which is said to apply exclusive measures, if you do not know this and if a disease progresss only slowly, as it is evident in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So, in April 1999, no blood was accepted by people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proved that this disease is transmitted via blood.
Thus this event has shown us that the principle of caution we applied has a sense.
In 1999, a much more precise technique appeared on the market for the detection of HIV: Nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which allow direct in the blood of the donor to prove the occurrence of the virus itself, and not the antibodies against the virus, as was the case in the tests used so far.
The NSTs made it possible to shorten the incubation time between the time when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it and you could not recognize this has been significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one of 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
`In other words, it means that you would have to distribute 12 million blood conserves before someone was infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 40,000 and 500.000 blood conserves each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs where HIV was transmitted via a blood conservation.
I believe that you can feel well today when you get or write a blood transfusion to restore health," says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogens can get into the system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya virus has appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects through the blood.
We need to monitor without interruption," continues Dr. Décary before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supply in addition to a safe supply.
`The need rises because the population ages.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood supply network, which is an average of only 3% of the appropriate inhabitants of Quebec. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and fulfils the appropriate criteria can spend blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who provide their blood are not assumed because they are, for example, sick of AIDS or malaria, and who are traveling to a country where malaria is spread, is excluded from the blood supply for a year.
`With these 3% we can get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing stocks are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and they can no longer spend blood.
It is difficult to convince people to spend blood, but especially to keep them and bring them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour while spending blood," Francine Décary regrets.
With a yearly budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conserves but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart clots, eye apples and skin, which are used almost exclusively in the case of severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema Quebec, which also manages the only public Navel Blood Bank of Quebec.
In the navel tube, which was previously considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood in stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
`A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandst navel blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand per year.
`We should probably start making it available for transplantations at the beginning of the next year', Dr. Décary continues to describe that this program is very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finale
Thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all gates) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and decide the game of the quarterly final series in the saputo stadion, where the total gate ratio counted, qualified for the half-final round of the excretion games of the first League of the USL.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the nineteenth minute game.
After a first half time without gate both for the one and the other side, the middle field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sounders.
Remember, at the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a front of Seattles had introduced a 2 to 1 downlay.
In the half-finale Impact will measure with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 victory, but the Whitecaps went into the half-final round with a total gate ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to meet the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series are set today.
Shortly said - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number 1-thrio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the Star of the Encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a passport in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparing games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only gate of all shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game so I can feel.
`He was too fixed on it in the first half, Guy Carbonneau noticed.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy applause.'
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister shall not exclude elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected in today's partial election.
`Please move the course of our last large border in the north : This is the long-term goal Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, which he fully followed.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens spectacular pictures of water power plants, mines, from Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great funds like during the electoral period.
Against the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he told that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, namely the 'new economic area' which provides an agreement with France on employees, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister in recent times, the opening of the north - the northern area at 49th wide-grade - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explain why the north was a Jewel with huge potential, but did not call a date, no sums of investment or precise priorities for the future projects.
At least a few views on what could be done more: particularly water energy, forests, but especially mining sectors, favoured by the growth of the threshold countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr Charest's list, the north has 'Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area twice as large as France' `is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed how to demonstrate clearly that he is seeking to realise a national foundation space.
Quebec has grown very much by his connection to the north, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James book.
`It belongs to us, it's our future', he added after he had put a theatral break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, explained to the press Prime Minister.
`This is a traditional attitude that persecuted all governments.
There is a borderline where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity I will take this attitude back on behalf of the government," he explained.
In addition, `with the climate change we have to reconsider our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be ridiculable throughout the year because of the ice cream.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the inhabitants and the inuits?
The Prime Minister said that Quebec's government would deal with them very carefully and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ehemal pecists of Ungava) have already launched discussions in about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Transport and Ground Taxes) takes a major place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to create a common vision.
The development of the north will also take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the plan Nord will be discussed, regulated and environmentally, he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as if it was a continuation of the liberal Prime Ministers who were in office before him.
`As the liberals who were in office before us, we have thought about transforming the challenges into new growth and development scenarios.
This was one of the topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a great cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the partial leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted plans to rename the power plant of Beauharnois to Adélard-Godbout-Stauddamm.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about reading that reached the silent revolution and the state of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James book, always knew our party to determine the future,' explained Jean Charest.
On the other hand, he referred to another conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 to 1963.
As regards the project Water Power Damm Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest emphasizes that it was intended to be put into service for 2012.
"It remains among us, but I'm about to be there," he trusted his party members, which led to those storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has in fact the possibility of holding this autumn a choice that is possible for him from the law, not yet excluded.
He emphasizes, however, that his calendar is full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The Weekend General Assembly created a platform of nationalist plans to the Liberal Party Manager, particularly from 'the Constitutional objectives' which were adopted without further delay: the PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of the 'Specificity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and have a veto regarding the decisions taken in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the Nord plan have been adopted with skepsis.
The Chief of the Party of Québécois, Pauline Marois, has reiterated the Nord-du-Quebec policy which the Landry Government introduced in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, has failed to apply them.
If she had done so, we would have been much further today, Mrs Marois judged at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has spoken to support the adoption of a plan in the north by the government.
`But what we want is that this is not just a big idea," explained the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the vacation today.
Letters - A Despised Country
Mr. Vic Toews, Ex-'Justiz' minister (which irony) at the Harper cabinet was the one who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that she was a 'shande' for Canada.
This woman, who has fought an unwilling fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with foolishness, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister, as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that has not brought home his countryman caught in the Guantanamo concentration camp as the only of all the countries concerned.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadri was still a youth than the things happened that are being disposed of him.
The only government who, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier go to it under inhuman conditions.
The only one who leaves to a court parodie to assess the blame of the accused.
Remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian lawyers are pleasing to bring Omar Khadri home so that he can get a fair process in Canada.
This government also closes the eyes before torture: it is little interesting for her that after so many years of pain, a young adult will surely be broken forever.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are currently experiencing a mysterious clipping of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper is constantly carrying as a flag before himself, and that sounds so none of his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen may be arbitrarily abused, tortured and locked up, according to the good thoughts of a Head of Government, who is only supported by the minority until today (may be part of minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation with a party preaching virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has dismissed the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this release, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The orwellish speech of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms and follows an orwellian logic that the world's largest gold gain society endeavoured a blasphemy of more than six million against three authors and a small medium-sized publishing house, with the aim of opening a public transparent debate.
If it is true that the judges are independent and unpartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of blasphemy, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely disguised by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to lead a public debate to drive everyone into ruin who dares to represent one of its opposed opinions.
Whatever the process is going on, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and to fight against a army of lawyers paying from the nearly insufficient bags of the gold mine.
The tactics of these inequal struggles are often to ruin the defenders, to force an agreement that makes the other side mouth-dood and also to scare anyone who dares to deal again with the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually carried out by the exchange of ideas and not by knobs.
So it would have been enough if the Gold Mine had opened their books and documents and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams that could have brought light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a public debate at the same time and, in this case, disregard the opinions of this public?
It seems that this word in the world of the Vice-President covers only the generously paid lawyers, not the Community of all Canadians; a very beautiful viewpoint of the term.
In a democracy, the defendant itself has the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this especially because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and condemn Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a kneebel claude (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a claim to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it demands that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom to academic research and the finding of truth, which is fundamental to every democratic society.
It fully denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment of which we belong has long been aware of how to tackle debates and disagreements and solve conflicts.
The disproportionate complaint by Barrick Gold clearly shows that, in contrast to what she claims, it does not want a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unjustified complaints.
Rescue Action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
The management of Bush and the executive Congress Members, Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the great depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaking Wall Street for months, has to be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main content is: better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public funds used, new facilities to prevent the number of houses that are placed on the basis of payment residues, and the right to monitor the wages paid to the directors of the supported companies.
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Members of Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, who was present at the negotiations, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
`We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective', explained the representative of the administration of Bush, Henry Paulson.
"It happened everything to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis at Wall Street," explained the democratic.
`This is the basic point: If we do not, the trauma, the chaos and disturbance will be enormous in the daily lives of the Americans," explained the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, in fear of the effect of a re-infringement on the atmosphere of investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidency candidates, who first participated in the negotiations lately, showed themselves rather as the supporter of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction about the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama relied on the addition of certain facilities to agree, especially those to allow the owners to keep their houses and those which concern the employees of the governing employees of the companies rescued by the State.
`If you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures due to the unresponsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to congratulate you on.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on the American television broadcasters.
When he was asked on another transmitter whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain answered: `I would like to know the details only, but I hope it.
`The directions I have read show that this is one thing that we must all devour, and with which we will be able to proceed.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
It arrives 14 months after a crisis triggered by the place of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage credits (subprime) before expanding to further forms of more widespread loans (PCAA), and finally to freeze into the financial power and ruin of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican Members had failed the first attempt to agree last week.
Since the democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of society in distress are only to be secured and not purchased by the government, it is believed to escape the sackgasse.
In order to round the perspectives for all at the Congress, one has also added an offer that says that if the government should make losses with this programme within five years, they can then raise new taxes to retain its capital used.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can be added to another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The further 350 billion payments must be adopted in a reconciliation vote by the Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that will bring him dividends in the event of gains and that can sell it again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to stop the settlement procedures relating to the housing of the real estate credits concerned by this plan, and also to set deadlines for repayment and findings paid to the directors of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Members to vote on him today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not sure that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday, there were other votes against this project, both from the Republicans and Democrats.
"We are obviously not understood by Washington," explained the Republican Scott Garett, member of the Financial Commission of the Chamber, his voters.
`Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are in order to ask the taxpayers to the box.'
The democratic Member Brad Sherman, head of a group at the Congress called 'the Caucus of Skeptics', represents things different, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, have written us to inform us: We ask the Congress not to be under pressure, and carefully consider what way is going to be," he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we again received evidence in Europe that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial government of the Fortis Banking Group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The entrance of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank announced GDP Paribas that she would not buy her competitor, which is in major difficulties since she lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis by the risky real estate credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and belongs to the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'That's not lost money, said yesterday the Dutch Minister for Finance, Wouter Bos.
In order to compensate, we receive a right of choice and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savings and households appreciate, now as uncertain times announce themselves.'
During this time, the British government was just in the opposite side of the Armelkanal to state another bank in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take all current loans at Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the UK Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has had to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty with the azure blue eyes was long his trumpf, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actress liberated with the charming smile from the Nazi mirror?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensibility and an obvious talent must have kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a big runner!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he was similar to and for which he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his play, with surely more devastating, but likewise an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a son of a German Jews and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, extremely quality feature.
Because in him, a whole country that was in love with the self-made-man reflected in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific war, who studied actuator art in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success in the theater, television and soon also in the movie.
This man who struggled for civil rights was also the driver who became the 24-hour race of Mans Second in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a pre-view relationship with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown faces of this mysterious, resistant, engaged and over-sensitive star glamour of showbusiness, whose puzzles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman moved the film lovers this weekend into Taumel, while on the dark screen of the reminders all his great roles were played.
More than a half-century American film art in constant change moves over with him.
The charming cowboy from the "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) will again come into memory, and the young man who rejects his senseful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot sheet roof filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter backward memory (1990) is raised to his sensible Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed at his high age by a wedding that did not fulfill all its promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were there in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A hand full of fools) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, was resumed after his death and made the Newman correctly known in 1956.
This sympathic Ganove in the superb Sting, which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and rapy Billard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, he was.
He's still there.
In his lifetime, Epoches are united.
The youth knows him mainly from the culture film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as the reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox Coach of an Eishockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a last role in 2003 as the father of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle was closed.
Unlike several cinema legates who have withdrawn early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the seat for a long time, and thus tell Hollywood, his assets, his prunk and his concessions.
The French film maker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the "Underplaying" when he assessed his all too powerful performances.
The meter was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, who flew to the rolls for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an external side: Neurotics, alcoholics, fists or desperate, with which perfect representation he shielded and reflected his rebellion.
As director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the Roman of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, signed a fine female portrait full of melanchol.
He, who lost his son Scott by overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of fine feeling and sadness.
During the flood of honor that went over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former armed companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared very much: "Our presence has improved my life and this country."
Mildness and joy of life were essential properties of the deceased actress.
Apart from his legendary career, a great prosecutor of citizens' rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, a opponent of Hollywood's departure, is now going there.
We may have seen him often with the foot in the shell full of vinaigrette, in sauces, baggages or other foods standing, and this considered quite tasteless, although we found it fun at first.
The profits from his turnovers nevertheless flow into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.'
And it was a honor for us to be allowed to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actress.
An exemplary citizen, in the closest and in the broadest sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of grant &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations begin in the criminal process against Jáno's grant and its complications.
In particular, the defendant is entrusted with the participation in organised crime, as well as serious harmful injury and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including counterfeiting of documents.
According to the prosecutor, the appropriations made in the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the benefits provided were often invoked with false invoices.
State funds and grants from self-administration - total HUF 65 million - are to be partly flown into the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly into individual private funds.
As the detection authorities announced, fictional invoices were presented in relation to the tender funds, and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the accusation, most of the invoices should have been faked.
The accounting blocks were purchased on the market by Jozsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on the round north of the Plateensee to which Isván Lados was sent by Jáno's grant.
During this "exploration tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He demanded accounts about the consumptions to be able to postpone later on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Labour, as well as the self-administration of Budapest.
These invoices should have been manipulated by the majority of Isván Lados and his complicate, András
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer room.
As two invoices issued by grants and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is supposed to have accommodated the ninety-headed group of the Association of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the manager of the company indicates that such a large group would not have entered the locally at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation of Job Jöv ért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also revealed serious form and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which only has three rooms and can not accommodate more than ten people at the same time, it is supposed to have stopped 130 guests according to the invoice.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently no limits as was the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Job Jöv ́ért and Hoppá, according to the accusation authority, did not even appear.
As Managing Director Gy ́z ́ Farkas of hvg.hu announced, he was immediately aware that it was false documents when he was presented by the prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were wrongly applied on the stamp."
And further: Besides form errors, the fact was also wrong that the company should have accommodated a hundred people after they have a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to offer as many people space.
The restaurant has also been invoked at the invoice, and has been in operation for a long time.
The emsige accounting counterparts have also failed to check that the Budapest travel agency taken to their visit only offers travels abroad, so they indicated Hungary's rice on the cash payment account, which was also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
As in the context of the investigations, they also referred to VAT on the invoices, although travel office services related to a country outside the EU are VAT free.
The amount of VAT was at the total of four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation of Job Jöv ́ért, as the operation was calculated at only 15 percent VAT instead of 25, and the employees issued exclusively machine invoices, but the counterfeit documents were handwritten.
A further error that had been undergone by the "accounting officers" was that in one case they had declared "care transport" as a performance, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment consultancy, the prosecutor informed.
Further form errors - incorrect account format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued at Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapittvány, as well as at XXI Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be declared as fakes.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managers used to never have issued the invoices.
Another "defect" is the false ones at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was just in dissolution at the time (2001) when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass manager therefore indicated that the invoices were not issued itself.
Consciously faked
The other group of accounting officers are persons who were well aware that they would have to put fictional bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapitvány has issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, in an amount of approximately 4 million HUF.
According to the complaint, the manager of the Collab Kft was persuaded by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional invoices.
The biogate Kft. currently also held in Liquidation is also intended to cooperate with grant and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH was expected to have provided the Foundation of Job Jövیért Alapítvány, as well as the Associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vorösfeny.Egyesület with fake invoices in total of 5 million HUF, which relate to unavailable services.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, but what the concerned have forgotten in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers comprises persons directly linked to the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postal commander of the Ukrainian Manager of Delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest but not foundable fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices on the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF approximately 18 million in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the detection authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas has been the buyer of these invoices since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian who should also be delivered by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigations, Kubatov stated that invoices on behalf of the GmbH were issued to the Associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that they had cashed their value itself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are supposed to have been founded by Romanian murders on Iván Kubatov's express wish.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, according to accused orders lacking.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: On request of his complication, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued accounts to the associations associated with the award, such as atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Totally, Kubatov has 15 invoices in total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of companies cash investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade issued to the organisations.
The prosecutor assumes that Cubatov could have cashed 10% of the total and VAT each.
Kubatov was to have even misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the socialist party's non-profit organization, Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány ("TMA").
Both received 500 000 forints each, but these amounts have benefited from abroad.
To do this, they submitted five fictional accounts to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were also secured during the examination of the office of Árpad Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
The negotiations are now expected by some defendants with a consent of the procedure of countervailing accounts, as they have already been made before the prosecutor.
A sensation could be if the main accused Jáno's grant to a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already agreed several times to report comprehensively about everything, his confession still stands out.
So the question remains open, whether this is in its interest, whether the socialists have completed a pact with him regarding the recompensation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether a grant in return is ready to take over the responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the "insulted" now plays the "insulted" after his search for mildening the arrest and house arrest had been put on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have suffered much greater damage with economic offences and have not paid them for them are free, or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains rejected.
The psychology of survival - or why we are ready to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and therefore overestimate the error.
Neurologens and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be struck in a competition, such as an auction to eBay, and are therefore ready to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological schema of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play lotto, while the others participated in a playback action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain, was measured in losers of the auction, where the survival of the opponent plays a key role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-rewarding" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore believed that the increase in prices could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of Striatum.
In order to support these, the economists in the research group have carried out additional investigations to follow up the money.
In this case, three groups against one partner should be involved under different conditions.
The control group has been informed of the true value of the product and then they have done their efforts.
Another group was also promised 15 dollar rewards, in case they are a winner from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between both groups was therefore merely that the emphasis on one on the profit, while the other was on losing.
However, as a proof of the hypotheses expressed by neurologians, the members of the group of "to lose" were ready to make more efforts than those in the control or win group.
"These results can not be derived from any previous economic theory.
Indeed, these have justified the behaviour observed in auctions with the joy of gain or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved through the formative neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the New York University Economic Faculty.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor visit?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be hundreds of thousands in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepaticity is the concept of collecting for various viruses infectious liver diseases.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellow occupancy are frequently, but the inducers and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogens, hepatitis viruses are spread in two different types: hepatitis A and E are transmitted by the digestive tractor (e.g. by contaminated foods or water), hepatitis B, C and D may be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, skiing secrets or spear).
Travelers are recommended to vaccine against the viruses A and B, in any case, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A show approximately two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by unwelcome, weakness, stomach pain and breakthrough.
Afterwards the yellow occupation occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the healing may take up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, approximately 1 million people die on hepatitis B, much more severe diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that estimates suggest that only every tenth of the infected patients are in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, since the influenza destroys the liver cells softly - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Consequently, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequently: those who have undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug dependents, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients is estimated to be 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory study, it is advisable to visit the home doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
At the time, the disease is healable, the virus can be eradicated, thus banning the risk of infection and preventing the emergence of cancer.
The 30th September is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 for the first time organized by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of the chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As most recent research results show that religious belief is like a kind of "smerger" that has already been facilitated by the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has been examined the extent to which faith in God affects the human pain feeling, reported the British leave "Telegraph".
During the more bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks, while studying a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to disable the majority of the pains.
Through a brain scan technology, it was even demonstrated that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project, which, in addition to scientists, also participates philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
When trying, the subjects were attached a sparkling device to the left hand, which gave the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: one of the pictures of God's mother, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with the Hermelin".
The scientists hoped that the sight of the virgin Mary among the believers would produce a kind of religious trance, while they chose the image of Vinci, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt it was comfortable.
The subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, and at this time they received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should view either the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "in security" when they looked at the mother of God, as if they were "careful" and they had felt "ruhe and peace".
During viewing the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than they had in mind Leonardo's work.
The Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thought that you could also produce similar effects with other, strongly-acting images, also with the atheists, you would have to find the appropriate photo.
"We need to find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of research.
"The practitioner of faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image Leonardos or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're saying about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthdays, Google can claim fog and right: she is found in the people's pockets as well as over her heads in heaven: she knows where people have spent their vacation, what specialists they are going to, and what they are moving to.
And that is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the managers of Google.
In the direction of skeptics who are plagued by Orwellschen horror visions, he lets it explain: these would just overlook the essential of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main goal of Google is to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company's original goal, which they want to "order all the information of this world".
Schmidt explained that after 10 years of world change, Google is still at the beginning of the information collection.
Ask for the status of Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?" but are software programs still not able to do so because they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their Internet searches the search terms were recorded, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited sites.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and go back to it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic, the so-called "recommendations" are also based on which the system recommends customized products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the case of data abuse - "When you check what I'm doing" - some are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that excites fear, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire for the power that is rejected by many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but also distributed to third parties, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, through which Google of the Brazilian government provided information collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also allowed the identification of pedophilia.
However, users concerned with personal rights were able to breathe in May when Google, together with the Civil Rights Organization of the EFF, successfully moved against the FBI before court: so Google can also be forced in the future with no point of the Constitution to publish information to the FBI on a secret request.
(Allerdings the Federal Government has successfully resulted in the release of 50.000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the youth protection law adopted years ago, but it has been retained from the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list to two months.)
So Google's Image remains controversial: Those who do not spend their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimacy through the use of the Google services, the company is disgusting with the conservative companies.
However, the American geek culture, which is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both fight for the same goal.
A possible reason for this is that Google does not request its users identification codes, as opposed to Microsoft, and its services are available free of charge, so that an open, continuously updated source code and program package seems to be far more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking at the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been focused in particular in the past years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" concerns nothing other than collaboration, speaking, the users are deliberately leaving tracks and benefiting from the available communication channels, and even though the sizes are different individually, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
A average youth can at the same time manage its profile on several Community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect with other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually bind all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo gallery that are placed on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: When viewing the last night's party photos, the friend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is dismissed because in his blog he only makes all too honest his anger about business management air - one is sure: the term "Privacy" has now been re-interpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he awards from himself - in some way you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever is trying to keep something secret, or even cope with the Google monopol, can like to do that - as with Scroogle, a tool that, though accesses Google's search engine, will not deliberately leave any traces.
Not a few people are deliberately not registering on Community pages so that they are not found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore not create the best possible profile from the user.
The public opinion, however, waits for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even in front of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly faster imported services are not only providing Microsoft but also other software developers head breakdowns.
Critical observers, however, also find the disturbing counterpoles: For example, the group leadership has completely rejected a protest from the employees after the fees of the company's own child garden were doubled, and the management also considered the multiple meal of the employees too expensive. However, this all is too courageous against the fact that Google was even in the knees before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed with an agreement that all regiment critical meetings, or those who would be inflicted against the good taste.
The group's internal regulation is that no new service will be acquired in advance, but only if it is available. However, the events of the next months and years could recreate somewhat: While some think that Google's book and magazine scanning or archivering project is currently taking into account the extent that the company will soon have to interfere with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned with the "Health" system that enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors already delivers the substance - about "Scroogled", the famous novel of Cory Doctorov describes in best orwellish manner a future in which a human being becomes terriblely approachable thanks to Google's data.
Two young people help the double murderer of Ozd with track removal
In connection with the double murder of Ozd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping to eliminate the traces, the speaker of the Police Commissioner Borsod informed on Tuesday.
The young people were stable and are currently accused of aid.
According to the information provided by the news agency MTI, it is two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with a penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is suspicious to have deliberately murdered several people.
During the investigations, it has appeared that the 23-year-old owed a greater amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to repay his debts, so he attracted his believer to an area in Ozd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of long hand - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murders with a gun hidden on the site.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon as well as the circumstances of their use.
Warschauer Börse offers purchase for Prague Börse
Approximately EUR 200 million, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warschauer's exchange has offered for the hundred percent purchase of the stock packages of the Prague exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of Warschauer Börse, confirmed the offer that the Poles had made, despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchanges.
Reason for this is that Warsaw's stock exchanges belong to the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
Following reports from the Czech daily newspaper "E15" the Poland offeres include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna exchanges, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Exchange and the German Exchanges have made offerings.
Petr Koblic, Head of Prague Exchange said last week that of all interested parties the Warsaw exchanges would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not conclude that this could lead to the closing of the Prague Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Exchange to 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholder agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent share, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the international financial crisis, which is increasingly focused on, on Tuesday, some leading European leaves were already spoken of "second 11 September".
The global financial disaster we ought to blame the American President, said, for example, "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to make his own party for the draft law behind himself, which should bring a bit of relief into the distressing situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-wide investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September".
Parts of the press in Madrid also place the sinnbock in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo" the lack of political leadership is blame for the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to break up, and there will suffer the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now threatens after the vote in the Congress the danger that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy is hanging in the air just at a time when one of the biggest transformations of capitalism's history takes place.
You can no longer let the threat out of mind, for example the Geneva means "days" indicator.
Even though some countries could provide their banking institutions with a disadvantaged savings packages and the banks could save the taxpayers' money from the bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are still more banks, then no further financial talks or other emergency measures will help.
In the long term, the EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise the control of money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion has been paid to weakening money institutions, the Vienna's "The Standard" reminds us. In addition, the newspaper continues to be more realistic that, according to the Americans, the European taxpayers should now take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
Until now, the EU has not seriously faced the crisis that is now a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "Retters" would not have to "bound" immediately with a number of hundreds of billions of euros, it would be advisable to maintain in which case it would be reasonable to tackle the money of taxpayers in order to remedy even more damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies for accident prevention if not to imitate the natural barrier sensors?
For example, the bees.
The CEATEC in Japan presented an amazing project in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired when creating new accidents avoiding systems.
In collaboration with the Tokiot University, Nissan has built the biomimetic system of type BR23C, a mini-car, equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collision.
In the flight, each bee forms its own oval "Private Area", which is very similar to our own "protective sign", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composed eye of the bee, which can see in every direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, play an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in a face field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately introduces the collision avoiding process.
The obstacle is recorded in second break parts, and the authoroboter immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike existing systems, this manoeuvre takes place instinctively.
"If it wouldn't, the authoroboter could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the authoroboter project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innerest and most vulnerable part of the protective sign - a layer that is currently considered unavoidable within the accident.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of bees when they eliminate other bees.
And that must be done in the fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, it can not go up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, only towards the turnability of the tyres.
While the bees are infinitely open in order to eliminate other bees, the scientists could only use the rotational movement, or acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy-efficient and therefore have longer life than traditional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process some inputs per second and respond accordingly to them.
It doesn't need to save it, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous manoeuvre, so that it is currently using a handful of KB memory.
No Gigabyte and Megabyte hard memories are required.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan's estimate, will be seriesly in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in the GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading it to the target.
A name for the sinful child
Now, the written version of the 700-million dollar heavy rescue package code is present, which will be applied in several stages and aims at the purchase of bad loans from banks.
In the first passage, half of the money is to be spent.
Reuters reported that in a meeting ending on Saturday after midnight Eastern Coast, the Congress Members, after several days' debates, reached an agreement on the 700 million dollars of severe rescue package.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American House, and said that the agreement should only be brought to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
As a result, Minister Henry Paulson said: the programme will show effect and it will be effective, but you have to do more. According to Pelosi, it was not about saving the Wall Street, but about shaping the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before opening the Asian markets, that is, Washington's time Sunday evening 8 (Medium European Time Monday 2:00 in the morning), but has not triggered an elevation flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the parliamentary House first votes on the draft law for the stabilisation of the economy of 2008, then the Senate is in line.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
However, the programme declines from the initial recommendation of the Bush administration, which suggests that the 700 billion dollars should be spent once for the purchase of fauler, credited securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is intended to be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on Monday. This sum is to be used for the purchase of credit cards, bad securities, and over the next 100 billion USD is to decide.
The programme is reviewed by a Commission which is also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
For the purposes of the Law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactics: it can at the same time buy bad loans, hypotheses, and hypotheses charged with securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As competent persons of the Ministry have reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds and pays the fees to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary resources so that up to 700 billion dollars can be provided as immediate aid for the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk that is triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it was signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and now dependent on state aid can expect that their finishes, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the Overseas Snake, will be reduced by the government.
A reduction in wages will only exist in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry buys in the framework of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the executive banking officer is suspended to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of faulty loans, the government will act aggressively in order to ensure that the manager's salary is not excessive.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements, so that more people are involved in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history that reductions are regulated by law in manager wages, the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the action.
The State gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers is lower, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank become better.
The draft law provides that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years, how taxpayers should recover their losses from the financial sector.
On both sides, however, there were skeptics who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not at all protect the money of taxpayers, says the Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were advanced by the same persons who are also responsible for the collaps of the Wall Street.

The largest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly in bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, in shoes the prices increased by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and production (1.6 per cent).
A price reduction was observed in raw oil processing (1.4 per cent), in electrical and technical devices (0.9 per cent) and in small proportion in wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices in the paper manufacture, as well as in the publishers and in the printing industry remained unchanged.
In other branches of the processing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the main domestic markets in the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
If the domestic markets of the manufacturing industry are considered in the annual comparison, prices in raw oil processing have increased as much (32.4 per cent).
In the metal processing sector a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, drinks and tobacco was 11%.
A price reduction was observed in the textile industry (2.5 per cent) and in electrical and technical devices (0.3 per cent).

Compared to the euro, the domestic currency became by 1.7 percent, to the dollar by 7.1 per cent weaker, and compared to the course of August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro, even by 15.9 per cent in the dollar.
No more visa to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances for the American-Hungary visa agreement to enter into force around the 12th year, as the Foreign Minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian municipality in Chicago.
Their view is that "all things are only dependent on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in overseas time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no permit for entry in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The Hungarian diplomat leads negotiations in Washington from now on.
It meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will give her the "Mediterranean Cruise with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also talk with the foreign policy consultants of the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican president John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support savings packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidency candidates of the large American parties, promised their support for the 700 billion dollars of salvation package for banks on Sunday. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After days of Marathon consultation on Sunday tomorrow, the Congress and representatives of the government announced that they had reached an agreement on the Bank Rescue Package.
The crisis of the Wall Street, as well as the emergence of the frozen credit market, became one of the key issues of the Presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suitable than the opponent in order to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
Following recent surveys, Obama was able to continue to expand his proximity thanks to the economic topics, while McCains High, who has been melted at the same time as the presentation of Vice-President's candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention.
At a election event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will accept the law of 700 billion dollars of heavy packages quickly.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passages of consumer protection that it has supported.
"We need to act now, responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industry branches, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 viewers.
He did not fail to mention McCains economic visions as "obsolet".
In an interview given to the transmitter ABC, McCain explained: "We will all have hard to bow (...) but nothing is certainly no alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a Control Commission for the Ministry of Finance, and the restriction of the finishes for top managers - something that he was on.
The CBS said Obama that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, informed that the parliamentary House is likely to vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press view of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters were self-conscious within the camp - so commented "The Mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror ( mirror.de)
In the online edition of the left-down German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned police officer, the Erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bayern for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch break is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy as for Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU was not surprising, but on Sunday something ended, but it was already quite exactly ten years ago: the doubtless hegemony of a state party
For ten years ago, 1998, the CSU has landed at 47.7 percent and has fallen under the fifty percent marks for the first time since the fifty years.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Federal Day elections, which is still in the highly quoted Stoiber-Ara.
Modernisation consistently carried out by the CSU in the state has finally destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but they were considerably damaged at the rate, but without any impact the secularization, the results of education, the passing of East and North Germans to the prospering regions of Bayern could not remain faithful to the CSU winners.
Modernisation is always consistent with optional increases, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters in the camp became more critical and more selfish.
It is noted that in recent weeks the classical citizens' groups have expressed the largest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and the electorates with abiturs such as college graduates.
Here CSU support decreased to even less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna's daily newspaper reports in their "Who with who? Party managers who hold back in coalition questions" articles about the chaotic internal position in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions for conversations, while the greens do not want to define themselves in relation to a coalition yet.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the heads of the parties were hardly able to look in their maps.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very well possible - in some countries and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP-Chef as a vice-chancer, left Faymann open.
As he said, the electors would have elected the Schüssel-Molter course.
A repetition of this direction would not be questioned.
But murderers have responded carefully to red offers.
Cooperation could not be fruitful, he said when Faymann was trying to mix himself into internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in the coalition, is currently fully open and these issues should be discussed on the internal market.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are willing to take over government responsibility," says Haider.
Yesróka: The Devil Circle of Poverty and Segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which is directed by the EU Presidency country of France.
In its speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, the Fidesz Member of the European People's Party, in particular to the education segregation, since it is one of the most serious infringements that Roma children suffer, and this is the greatest obstacle to their needs.
The high-level conference was opened by French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and civil organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the Fidesz Members report, Járóka has noted that, in addition to discrimination in the search for jobs, Roma would be exercising from the labour market mainly because of its low level of education.
"The large majority of Roma youths have no secondary education, and thanks to a bad basic education, only a small part of them can reach a degree of education".
In addition, Járóka stressed that education was a fundamental human rights which would be a key role in making other human rights valid.
Investments in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
The Members believe that it is important that this context becomes aware of the widest possible circle, that is, Roma and non-Roma.
Because the earlier a Roma student starts school, the more the more its chances to become a productive member of the labour market, and by means of income and turnover tax they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the bad and segregated education must be stopped" says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member explained, a common, target and action-oriented approach of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the disegregation process in the educational sector, and to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly respected.
"We must break through the devil circle of poverty, Segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic possibilities to contribute to the future of Europe as fully justified citizens," Járóka urged.
Since the convention in Berlin last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the prior implementation of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national level, in the meaning of the "European Year of Equality".
CSU: Grace at time
At the end of October, the destiny of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is determined
Despite the election debtor, no heads have been rolled yet, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debates have been dismissed.
Head of Party Erwin Huber and Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace would be.
The fate of the Tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent voice loss will be decided on the last October week's day of the extraordinary party.
But the much educated duo already made it look through that it doesn't want to stick on their chairs.
They want to address the agitated group and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bayerian Tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - conceived under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber at his career height - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the pussy against Stoiber, they could only secure 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was "aloneregierer" in Bayern, which produces 18 percent of German GDP.
The conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern state of the Hungarian economy, but will need to be governed in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of partial restructuring, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice-President and Bundesagrarminister Horst Seehofer is also involved in the exploration team, which leads with the liberal FDP, or the judicial "Free Choices" talks about a possible Munich Coalition.
A irony of fate is the same that with the list of "Free Choices" that Gabriele Pauli enters the law, whose anti-Stobs appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first used to then defend the targeted politician in vain.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who hitherto pulled the threads out of the background, becomes an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called the "bitterest day of his political course" on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic comments towards CDU - his view that the CSU would have earned much more support from the Sister Party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed much to success at national level in 2005, is not reposed on the legs with a common force act, Merkel cannot become a kansler again after the Federal Day elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a hole from her disappointment about the fiasko, believes that the terrain loss of the CSU will not have a negative effect on the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relatively: the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of socialists will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has reached its best result in Bayern since 1946.
Lukaschenko opposition: 110-0
At the elections on Sunday, no Member of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament has succeeded.
Russian observers believe that this is a matter of prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects that the votes are not lawful.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
Although the Legislatur of the 10-million-inhabitant state has come out without opposition for decades. However, the counterparties gathered under the name "Unified Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections have seriously hoped that Lukaschenko, who already renewed his presidency mandate for the fourth time in 2006 at the unclear elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment, would "lay some members of the opposition in Parliament" this time.
Therefore, the ODS even took away from the previously planned boycots.
Ukraina is increasingly dependent on the increase in prices for the import of natural gas from Russia. For the reduction of price increases, even loans were recorded, and the country also agreed to the Russians the sales of Beltransgas, the owner of the country's gas pipeline, and, in the light of the expectations of the opposition, the hope that Ukraine will improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukaschenko and other high-level politicians have been classified as an anti-democratic ban on entry into the EU.
The OECD electoral evaluation report, which emphasized the positive movements rather than the defects, such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections, provided for temporary relaxation.
However, on Monday, the OECD's Quick Report criticised the campaign - and therefore oppositional would not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present when speaking the votes.
Despite all, the opposition can recognize a improvement in the political system: Political prisoners have been set free, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continueing to recognise the independence of the deceased Georgian provinces South-Ossetia and Abchasia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, has regarded the two regions as independent for a month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our magazine.
According to the opposition candidates of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to continue, although "the mighty were afraid to leave only one oppositional in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the oppositional newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way when selling stones, but yet I see that more and more people support change, even the older," said Milinkewitsch in view of the fact that not even the most supported layer of the pensionists agree with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only earnings are the production of social security.
"Thanks for the debt of the country and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a question of time until the "social security" that is accompanying the silence of a cemetery begins to break," says Milinkewitsch.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, explained to the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the acts and not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electors.
Brunetta: "From now on, before work is frozen"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are twisted doors for the entrance and exit of the officials.
From now on, the measure will enter into force against those sluumiers, which first stamp and then go to drink coffee during the working time.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz Act" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Government and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">"Drewable doors are a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services", says Minister Brunetta.
"Now starts a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta once again underlines.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says, "the choice of the turnable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, assured by the Secretary-General: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
So everything in all there is no breakfast anymore during the working time; end with coffee or croissant .
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino works miraculously at 7 o'clock."
During a meeting of the Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione (Scuola Superiore della)
by Rome, the Minister announces that "in three months, the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60.000 people a year more attended to work".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"their wages-dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as high as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above inflation rates."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined together to cooperate with the Brunetta Decree in the context of the call supported by Codacons.
"When the Minister for Public Service is profiled with figures of less absenses at work - the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'acting faul pellets' grow uninterrupted.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have joined together to explain the decisive standards of the decisive decisives of war."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related disease; the planned extension of the obligatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the minister's new situation are raised.
Napolitano: "Prophylaxis against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day there are 2500 accidents in Italy, three people die, and 27 remains lifelong invalid.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazional contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents were around 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon, which is almost twice the number of deaths caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will be the 58th national day for victims of accidents in order to focus the attention of social institutions and media on this dramatic situation.
"The alarming data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the decisiveness of the prevention issue at work," confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of Amil (Associazione nazional mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention of jobs, to protect the injured workers, to support the families of victims and to make public opinion aware".
"A resented "Basta" has raised itself to this; understandably in tragedies that, measured in their order of size, triggers some twins in the media and involvement of the public. However, the everyday reality often faces us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not conceal that "there is in any case also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The number of initiatives for direct awareness in the school framework are particularly important for young people who are living in the labour world.
It is our duty to focus on this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness, and to bring into force and improve a legislative norm.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "which the phenomenon of labour-related deaths represents an urgent social disaster, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules aimed at ending the problem".
"The data of work accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is much too high," emphasized the President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you think you are actually doing too little to combat the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight by various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – so Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to inform the workers who already start in school."
"A further effort is necessary - so it adds - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility is asked by the employers to face a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli also called on "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the victims of accidents at work" and put forward the "absorption of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the employee a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident is not dependent on voluntary or random donations decided by a legislator from time to time."
Mp3 Player under charge: Danger of hearing damage
Sound music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This reports to the European Commission, quoting the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) in a report published in Brussels.
"The report – as stated in a comment – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable music devices for at least five years per week for more than one hour a day risk the lasting loss of their hearing."
"I am worried that such a large number of youths who usually put portable musical devices and mobile phones on a high volume will inevitably damage their hearing without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – it is said by the Eu – show a clear risk that is pressing to act quickly.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and make this information common.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the existing control systems in order to be fully effective and to take steps with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical devices among young people.
"Scientists - then the EU communication - confirm that they are too concerned and that the European Commission will now examine the necessary measures to protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard at the moment that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB. The concerns about the damage that could arise from a too large noise load.
You can limit these damages very much in order to address solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the sound showing.
In their report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union pointed out that when users of portable music devices hear only five hours a week loud (which is more than 89 decibel) music, the legal limits already exceeded that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this border risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This amounts to 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the European Union.
Roma, Alemanno gives the launch to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, in March it's over, in June the balance is drawn.
This is the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome" set by the Capitol. The Commission met in the new seat behind the Caracalla themes this morning.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project will be completed, the City and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the capitol and Oberborgermeister Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," stresses Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains by the City and the Municipal Council.
There is no re-distribution of competences, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve itself, since such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June - as the Mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence, as their opinion is lacking in liability, Alemanno replies: "All things depend on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deal with the everyday problems and emergency situations that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of view to work seriously with the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The Colonel Champion of Rome emphasizes the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to thought. It will occupy the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to allow our city a quality jump - which it really needs - and thus to do a common step in the future".
A future, says the Mayor of Rome, "which will not only be limited to the current local borders but will look much further", not only with regard to the role of Rome as the metropolis and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President?
A well-known American politician, who is a great deal of being regarded as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations with the enemyed Islam (and this still does as a private man today)".
The attacks on Obama become more and more violent, just now when the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a web page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very freak: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!"
However, these attacks are not much to say; they are racist attacks, and they do not answer the voters' question: Will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; everyone says that Obama will win with a great advance.
In this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: only in the election cabin we will know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here a American mentality appears, which has been kept hidden until the end.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our creeping, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something that was never heard before – only now when the success of the black candidate seems so sure.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the definitive weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error has Bush made during his term of office? 89% have answered: the war in Iraq.
America changes.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a trip into the hill.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness point.
The one who will take his job is facing a huge task.
United States. The financial collapse also leaves his tracks in journalists: In the newspapers you can feel the reductions. And many accuse the Internet, the "mörder" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were consulted by the PEW Research Center on their situation and mental control in the future.
Today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not really declare concern to those concerning the information relating to competitors because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for the American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists, a economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cutting of the newsroom, that is, the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent the traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from diminishing significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism meets the American journalist today.
Six of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong way at national level.
In the local area, the executives even account for 65%.
Printed versus Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction of the web.
The main publishers are moving the way to the Internet, which is considered by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to want to join the new technology in the hope of "they bring something good for journalism".
The biggest rice is in American journalism today between the chief actors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the chief players at national level are sure to share their values with them, while it is only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with the "security in work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "redacturers", note, Red.) is always a current topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and Internet operators, the employers offer as they like, and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
Chefredakteurs receive very often very high wages, but the editor can sometimes only receive 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance.
As far as the vacation is concerned, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they confess themselves, are often "sick" during the year.
It's a question of climate.
UNIPOL: DIRECTIVE IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBED IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of Judgment in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate maker, which had requested to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is identified against Coppola because of bank root in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a duty of residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate maker to be transferred from the province city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the Court, such discouragements (with regard to the prosecution of the prosecutor) could enable him to influence his society and obtain proof to him.
The Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had been revealed a few days ago when the parliamentary Chamber voted against the 700 billion dollar spare package of the White House: one large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing the Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the last edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the course of the republikan party is divided more and more into its old and moderate East Coast Sea, which always favored the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are "the ones in Washington" and the financial world enemy and wins in the south and the centre of the countries choosers.
This part of the party is due to its rise, for example, to the vote of which I mentioned above.
However, this example mentioned above is only a small part of the major changes that the present economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, even in the west and perhaps beyond it will be affected by them.
Both in the states as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-frightened events, which eventually take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unreasoned renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close links with abroad and at the same time manage an incredible amount of private households living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for the governments, namely how to behave with the families concerned, which also represent a huge voter mass.
So the crisis appears economically global, politically against it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been abandoned and lost its right of speech: the clearing evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division in various national and international conflicts, does not know a common way to find.
Therefore, all of us are now expecting the intervention of their own country; rescue plans, new rules, and a. distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more serious, only the US will be able to rescue in the economic situation without foreign assistance.
And in addition to the funds, they also have the legitimation to use these: thus two non-compliant conditions – under certain circumstances – to which otherwise no international organisation and no market will be able to take a similar approach.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is in perfect line with the growing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with the most closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradox is it just now, when we were so convinced that we have entered long in a networked whole world, into a realm of ever differentiated technologies, of intangible technologies, that at once we need to find out how our future will be increasingly dependent on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can all be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are still at the extreme with a tightly surrounded piece of Earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one with such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a harvestless, waterless or oil-free area.
I am now coming to the second news, but it requires a short insurrection.
Whoever Territory, who government, who says politics also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leaderships, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of dismantling over existing leaders, such as those of the economy, which have been insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeply sufficient and in some sense still disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an innocentness, a picture of inappropriateness, a feeling of remoteness, all of which focuses on a whole class of managers in the western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large parts of the population is the way that it is not only the acts of the social elites, but already their ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is more and more foreign and overwhelming.
So the demand for Leadership is undergroundly a devastating but powerful movement of the destruction of the leading class and the traditional political establishments. This is manifested in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the immediate turn of the collective state of mind of the past time: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bayern, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American members against Bush (and may also play a role in the victory of the rights in Italy).
You gain the impression that the old elite, its parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems, and therefore less representative value as to what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and still strengthened from the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be too exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes widely open is not sure.
The super sticker that lets go up on walls
The forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have almost reached the goal.
With a adhesive on a surface of only 2.5 qcm, researchers have managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives using a special carbon structure called carbon nanore tubes.
"The principle of the adhesive can be imagined as a row of a stack of spaghetti arranged tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, covered by microscopic heroes, which give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as Glass Teflon and Slip Paper have shown that the new sticker is ten times higher than the holdability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "remove problemlessly from the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering Sciences at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a perishable adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Something like Spiderman to empor to walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers rather think of a less fascinating advantage, such as the connection of electrical devices, as the nanor tubes are also leader of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the area of space.
So for the moment the super heroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, dedicates a new climbing species.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive from microfibres that cleans themselves like hair by moving on a surface even from dust and thus keep perfect liability.
Medicinal products: never take fruit juice
Caution from grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness v.a. in the summer, may cause serious health damage when they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme impact on the intake by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly pointed to the risk of packed and fresh fruit juice in connection with the intake of medicines. In the 236th Meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he reappeared alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the acceptability of certain vital medications, so that they are practically eliminated and thereby endangered the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular medicines, anxiolytic and neurologic medicines to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN FEHR – The same medicine agency had warned doctors and patients against the risks of this mixture in a report two years ago, and emphasizing that they should be careful for drinking in connection with medicines such as diazepine or methadone.
It IS NOT BY GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts also contains orange juice and apple juices that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, Michele Carruba, Director of Università Statale di Milano, appeals: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, to have no scourge to ask a pharmacist or a doctor," the expert on the Ansa Agency emphasizes.
Economic nobel price goes to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is to the American Paul Krugman for its analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and external policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a lead article of the New York Times that this second event had been more decisive for the history of the United States than the attents.
A prediction that did not receive a few polemics as an answer and was held to the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked about how quickly the memory of the scandales was disappeared in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom from the public view field," explained Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economy of great value", but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style that is particularly addressing the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the Open Source Software wins as a free replacement for Microsofts Office a growing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freeshipers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some news to the audience: in addition to a revised and now spartanically designed start menu, it is now finally a reason for guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
It also took account of compatibility with Microsofts Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those who allow it to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, e.g. e-mail dispatch. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphics editing modules and maintaining the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybride" PDF files can be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: tables can now be edited more handy by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor is assigned a fracture to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the cloud, while the definitive result is to be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
However, if the free of charge is an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it has also been in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed in the large throw: finally, various bodies of public administration and schools have already been transferred to OpenOffice.
In fact, it is not even missing a training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the Word related text generation program; Calc, the table program aiming at an explosion of Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as with Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of known access; and last Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded at 3 million and 600 thousands already reached.
Coal also positively tested and thus the fourth doping case
It opens a new doping case with the previous tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl des Teams Gerolsteiner, who is a third-classified and winner of the best climbing.
The news published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old coal of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver who was tested positively on Cera, the third generation Epo. This was already met with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis of the coal blood samples is one of those carried out in the last weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The Chief of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, also announced the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian went to the scene behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and claimed the tricot of the best climber for himself.
THEMA INTRODUCTION: THE New YORK TIMES REQUIREMENT: IS ITALIAN RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the one country of the migrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which is only taken against.
Does this from the Belpaese make a nation of racists? This asks the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy and from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he stole a package of cookies.
The case proves to what the Times calls "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and employment opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentations and the greatest support of the Lega Nord".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and for the faster elimination of illegal immigrants is also referred to as signs of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also emphasizes the Pope and the President of State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for cooperation between Church and State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900-Euros per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study by the Sunia, the Rental Association, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already adopted very serious moves. The whole group of students loses their right to study so in fact because their families are not able to support them at this level," says the manager of the Sunia, Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the great demand of the students leads to a deformation of the market, which also harms the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental price limits, unauthorised rentals.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which result in a review of taxation at lower rental prices.
In a more precise review of the investigation, it appears that in Milan a sleeping space is needed in the Brianza district, about 450 euros; a single room begins at 650 euros (in the quarter of Bande Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the district of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or some 900 euros in Vittoria.
In Florenz, an average sleeping space costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the quarters around the university, are EUR 250/280 for a bedplace of necessities, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the quarters around the University are approximately EUR 600 for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
Just a little deeper are the rents in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euros in Eastern and Cinecittà.
Only anyone in the outer district can save money: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need EUR 300 450 for a bedroom, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a bedroom costs 250-350 Euro, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of hire to non-European students is more frequently, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a hire of 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Bye-bye to the ancient Kino Paradiso – the cities close their historical cinema halls
The historical cinema closes due to the favoured multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinema is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what happens at the moment in the large city centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinema starting with the birth of the large multi-sale complex in the periphery means in the long term the death of the single-sale cinema in the centre. A process that seems not only irreversible and irreversible but also the moves of a cultural crime.
Most of these are historical places full of memories, "it is to lose like a friend with which one has left a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who introduced him the Oskar and the great price of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the history of a pre-town kinos and its nostalgie, which consists of living in a well-for-ever- lost cinema.
The numbers that the Anec, the central trade union, provide a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinema has to be closed; these cinema paid mostly the cinema in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Neapel, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinema, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and the Lombardei with 41.
This proves that the main guilts are the multiplexkinos, because there are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardei has listed the lists, 81 are both in the Tuscany and in the Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "though it is useful that new structures also occur, but first of all, the conservation of the already existing, because closing a hall in the city, are not all its tribal customers ready to visit instead of an old multi-exquino in the periphery.
And here remains the missing unit for the trade union fund: the debt burden recorded by the State is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral viewpoint that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million in the year of necessity."
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fear of the old cinema halls, has decided to protect them by an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The predicted measures include tax advantages for the cinema drivers as well as benefits for the audience with regard to the nearby transport: it will be allowed to drive to the transport restricted areas of the centre and also parking for more favourable parking fees.
"It's a delightful initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
But surely, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to do something against the superpower of multiplex halls, because finally the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the key point that brought me to the founding of the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even if I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; if I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to side to not see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia group.
The accusations of the lawyer of the Antimafia authorities of Kalabrien against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his vice-president Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for mafia business.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the Clan and the public administration, and his nephew, was also taken in hands: the lawyer, who is carrying the same name as the Chief of the Clan, had already been condemned for the involvement of criminal associations of the Mafia, to a remuneration sum of 10 million euros at that time.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard disregarding," the lawyers write, "had the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"So the Mafia group had been made possible – so the judges – to enter the Council houses officially and to take part in the public administration policy."
The President of the Regional Committee of Kalabrien Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "all other than an exception to interconnection of local administrations and organised crimes." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who oppose the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white west."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police of the Clan Piromalli, the police were excovered.
Since the end of April, the Municipal Council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but the local politicians of their municipal offices had already been removed in 1991 – and also because of claimed links between organised crime and local administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, has been elected as head of the Middle Right Coalition after the election of May 2006.
He shouted as the prefecture ordered the resolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in the Vice-President Marco Minniti, who he claimed to have found everything for political and strategic reasons. However, the judges, in connection with the arrest order of this morning, explain that the Piromalli-Clan even dared to apply for an amendment to the A3 project.
The willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus the public administration measures became identical with the interests of this clone."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones suddenly run up.
It is a non-squeezing source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and seems to understand the world's large energy companies only now.
Wells, flows and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now looking at all, and also seeking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies did not accidentally intensify significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke in 1980, the idea of sea energy was lost, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are pressing on new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy demand could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be the same as the double of the energy produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the flows and times were still available.
Giant at the attack.
The first company that now puts on sea energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the establishment of a power plant in the north of Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now increasingly more companies from the traditional energy industry who are applying to marine energy.
"Chevron explores these technologies" – the speaker of a company known to the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal – and weighs off the opportunity to cooperate with us."
This concerns the acquisition of an authorisation from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project before Alaska's coast.
This is a not too underestimative sign, for example, if you consider that just in Alaska, oil continues to be promoted by the United States and President Bush has recently launched the plans for new drilling.
Besides Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers are talking about an increasing interest.
Still improved technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in the outbreak, not least because the last doubts of environmental protectors have not yet been clarified.
Until now, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a smaller dimension and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy in a large scale, technologies with a much greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are various options: Ocean Power uses about a system of connected boys.
The shot of the waves, which moves the boys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimming pool over plumbs and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which, again, operates a generator.
The power is sent to the coast through subwater pipelines.
To date, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for State Authorisation. A part of the energy gained could also serve for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power already produces energy for a shopping house and a parking lot with the help of underseas turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the times drive the turbines, which, by the turning movement, eat the generator.
According to Verdant, a long snake of possible clients is waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
A special interest, according to the Institute for Electricity Research, is immediately deserving the potential that is in times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind flows, sun radiation and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of power.
It is just the time energy that brought states such as New York, Maine, Alaska and other coastal states to invest already $7.5 million in 2008 – for 2009 up to 35 million are already planned.
