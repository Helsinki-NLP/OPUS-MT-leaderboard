To get back to their previous energy level, they had to leave the extra energy that they had received from the light.
They're doing that by emitting a win-worthy lightparticle, called photon.
Scientists call this process "stimulated radiation mission", because the atoms of light light are stimulated, causing the emission of a light photo, and light is a type of radiation.
The next image shows the atom that emitters photos; of course, photons are much smaller than those on the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the material that atoms fade!
